Remarkably, several large population-based longitudinal epidemiological studies have recently indicated that the incidence and prevalence of dementia might be decreasing in Western countries.

AD, the most common form of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with impaired cognition and cerebral accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta). Most notably, the microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system that is not fully understood, but includes neural, immune, endocrine, and metabolic pathways. Studies in germ-free animals and in animals exposed to pathogenic microbial infections, antibiotics, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation suggest a role for the gut microbiota in host cognition or AD-related pathogenesis. The increased permeability of the gut and blood-brain barrier induced by microbiota dysbiosis may mediate or affect AD pathogenesis and other neurodegenerative disorders, especially those associated with aging. In addition, bacteria populating the gut microbiota can secrete large amounts of amyloids and lipopolysaccharides, which might contribute to the modulation of signaling pathways and the production of proinflammatory cytokines associated with the pathogenesis of AD. Moreover, imbalances in the gut microbiota can induce inflammation that is associated with the pathogenesis of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and AD. The purpose of this review is to summarize and discuss the current findings that may elucidate the role of the gut microbiota in the development of AD.

Considering that AD pathology begins decades prior to clinical symptoms, the higher risk in women cannot simply be accounted for by their greater longevity as compared to men. Recent investigation into sex-specific pathophysiological mechanisms behind AD risk has implicated the menopause transition (MT), a midlife neuroendocrine transition state unique to females. Commonly characterized as ending in reproductive senescence, many symptoms of MT are neurological, including disruption of estrogen-regulated systems such as thermoregulation, sleep, and circadian rhythms, as well as depression and impairment in multiple cognitive domains. Preclinical studies have shown that, during MT, the estrogen network uncouples from the brain bioenergetic system. The resulting hypometabolic state could serve as the substrate for neurological dysfunction. Indeed, translational brain imaging studies demonstrate that 40-60 year-old perimenopausal and postmenopausal women exhibit an AD-endophenotype characterized by decreased metabolic activity and increased brain amyloid-beta deposition as compared to premenopausal women and to age-matched men. This review discusses the MT as a window of opportunity for therapeutic interventions to compensate for brain bioenergetic crisis and combat the subsequent increased risk for AD in women.",,"['Scheyer, O', 'Rahman, A', 'Hristov, H', 'Berkowitz, C', 'Isaacson, R S', 'Diaz Brinton, R', 'Mosconi, L']","['Scheyer O', 'Rahman A', 'Hristov H', 'Berkowitz C', 'Isaacson RS', 'Diaz Brinton R', 'Mosconi L']","['Lisa Mosconi, PhD, Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, 428 East 72nd St, Suite 500, Room 407, New York, NY, 10021; Tel: (212) 746-4624, Email: lim2035@med.cornell.edu.']",['eng'],"['P01 AG026572/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR002384/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,J Prev Alzheimers Dis,The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,101638820,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/etiology/*physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Brain/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Hormone Replacement Therapy', 'Humans', '*Menopause', 'Risk Factors']",PMC6198681,['NIHMS990068'],2018/10/10 06:00,2019/11/09 06:00,['2018/10/10 06:00'],"['2018/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.14283/jpad.2018.34 [doi]'],ppublish,J Prev Alzheimers Dis. 2018;5(4):225-230. doi: 10.14283/jpad.2018.34.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Perimenopause', 'brain imaging', 'early detection', 'women']",['The authors declare no disclosures.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also examines in detail the financial impact of Alzheimer's on families, including annual costs to families and the difficult decisions families must often make to pay those costs. An estimated 5.4 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease. By mid-century, the number of people living with Alzheimer's disease in the United States is projected to grow to 13.8 million, fueled in large part by the aging baby boom generation. Today, someone in the country develops Alzheimer's disease every 66 seconds. By 2050, one new case of Alzheimer's is expected to develop every 33 seconds, resulting in nearly 1 million new cases per year. In 2013, official death certificates recorded 84,767 deaths from Alzheimer's disease, making it the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age >/= 65 years. Between 2000 and 2013, deaths resulting from stroke, heart disease, and prostate cancer decreased 23%, 14%, and 11%, respectively, whereas deaths from Alzheimer's disease increased 71%. The actual number of deaths to which Alzheimer's disease contributes is likely much larger than the number of deaths from Alzheimer's disease recorded on death certificates. In 2016, an estimated 700,000 Americans age >/= 65 years will die with Alzheimer's disease, and many of them will die because of the complications caused by Alzheimer's disease. In 2015, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.1 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $221 billion. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age >/= 65 years with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are more than two and a half times as great as payments for all beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. Total payments in 2016 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age >/= 65 years with dementia are estimated to be $236 billion. The costs of Alzheimer's care may place a substantial financial burden on families, who often have to take money out of their retirement savings, cut back on buying food, and reduce their own trips to the doctor. In addition, many family members incorrectly believe that Medicare pays for nursing home care and other types of long-term care.

However, previous clinical trials have pre-determined a single treatment modality, such as a drug candidate or therapeutic procedure, which may be unrelated to the primary drivers of the neurodegenerative process. Therefore, increasing data set size to include the potential contributors to cognitive decline for each patient, and addressing the identified potential contributors, may represent a more effective strategy. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a precision medicine approach to Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment is effective enough in a proof-of-concept trial to warrant a larger, randomized, controlled clinical trial. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment, with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores of 19 or higher, were evaluated for markers of inflammation, chronic infection, dysbiosis, insulin resistance, protein glycation, vascular disease, nocturnal hypoxemia, hormone insufficiency or dysregulation, nutrient deficiency, toxin or toxicant exposure, and other biochemical parameters associated with cognitive decline. Brain magnetic resonance imaging with volumetrics was performed at baseline and study conclusion. Patients were treated for nine months with a personalized, precision medicine protocol, and cognition was assessed at t = 0, 3, 6, and 9 months. RESULTS: All outcome measures revealed improvement: statistically significant improvement in MoCA scores, CNS Vital Signs Neurocognitive Index, and Alzheimer's Questionnaire Change score were documented. No serious adverse events were recorded. MRI volumetrics also improved.

This review highlights Kirtan Kriya (KK), an easy, cost effective meditation technique requiring only 12 minutes a day, which has been successfully employed to improve memory in studies of people with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and highly stressed caregivers, all of whom are at increased risk for subsequent development of AD. KK has also been shown to improve sleep, decrease depression, reduce anxiety, down regulate inflammatory genes, upregulate immune system genes, improve insulin and glucose regulatory genes, and increase telomerase by 43%; the largest ever recorded. KK also improves psycho-spiritual well-being or spiritual fitness, important for maintenance of cognitive function and prevention of AD. KK is easy to learn and practice by aging individuals.

We explore the hypothesis that art therapy is useful in dementia by reviewing the extant literature. With appropriate structure, patients with dementia can produce and appreciate visual art. Case studies and several small trials suggest that art therapy engages attention, provides pleasure, and improves neuropsychiatric symptoms, social behavior, and self-esteem.

We hypothesize that multimodal interventions that address many risk factors simultaneously and are individually tailored to patients may help reduce AD risk. We describe a novel clinical methodology used to evaluate and treat patients at two Alzheimer's Prevention Clinics. The framework applies evidence-based principles of clinical precision medicine to tailor individualized recommendations, follow patients longitudinally to continually refine the interventions, and evaluate N-of-1 effectiveness (trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03687710). Prior preliminary results suggest that the clinical practice of AD risk reduction is feasible, with measurable improvements in cognition and biomarkers of AD risk.

Commonly, and in line with the amyloid/neuroinflammation cascade hypothesis, microglia have been portrayed as potentially dangerous immune effector cells thought to be overactivated by amyloid and producing neurotoxic inflammatory mediators that lead to neurofibrillary degeneration. We disagree with this theory and offer as an alternative the microglial dysfunction theory stating that microglia become impaired in their normally neuroprotective roles because of aging, i.e., they become senescent and aging neurons degenerate because they lack the needed microglial support for their survival. Thus, while the amyloid cascade theory relies primarily on genetic data, the dysfunction theory incorporates aging as a critical etiological factor. Aging is the greatest risk factor for the sporadic (late-onset) and most common form of Alzheimer's disease, where fully penetrant genetic mutations are absent.

We searched the Web of Science and PubMed databases (from 2000 to October 27, 2020) for literature on the treatment of AD with sensory and multisensory stimulation, including music therapy, aromatherapy, rhythmic (e.g., visual or acoustic) stimulation, light therapy, multisensory stimulation, and virtual reality assisted therapy, then conducted a systematic analysis. Results show these sensory and multisensory stimulations can effectively ameliorate the pathology of AD, arouse memory, and improve cognition and behaviors. What's more, it can cause brain nerve oscillation, enhance brain plasticity, and regulate regional cerebral blood flow.

It is now recognized that pathophysiological changes begin many years prior to clinical manifestations of disease and the spectrum of AD spans from clinically asymptomatic to severely impaired. Defining AD purely by its clinical presentation is thus artificial and efforts have been made to recognize the disease based on both clinical and biomarker findings. Advances with biomarkers have also prompted a shift in how the disease is considered as a clinico-pathophysiological entity, with an increasing appreciation that AD should not only be viewed with discrete and defined clinical stages, but as a multifaceted process moving along a seamless continuum. Acknowledging this concept is critical to understanding the development process for disease-modifying therapies, and for initiating effective diagnostic and disease management options. In this article, we discuss the concept of a disease continuum from pathophysiological, biomarker, and clinical perspectives, and highlight the importance of considering AD as a continuum rather than discrete stages.

Deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) remains a hallmark feature of the disease, yet the precise mechanism(s) by which this peptide induces neurotoxicity remain unknown. Neuroinflammation has long been implicated in AD pathology, yet its contribution to disease progression is still not understood. Recent evidence suggests that various Abeta complexes interact with microglial and astrocytic expressed pattern recognition receptors that initiate innate immunity. This process involves secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and generation of reactive oxygen species that, in excess, drive a dysregulated immune response that contributes to neurodegeneration. The mechanisms by which a neuroinflammatory response can influence Abeta production, aggregation and eventual clearance are now becoming key areas where future therapeutic intervention may slow progression of AD. This review will focus on evidence supporting the combined neuroinflammatory-amyloid hypothesis for pathogenesis of AD, describing the key cell types, pathways and mediators involved. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Deposition of intracellular plaques containing amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a hallmark proteinopathy of the disease yet the precise mechanisms by which this peptide induces neurotoxicity remains unknown. A neuroinflammatory response involving polarized microglial activity, enhanced astrocyte reactivity and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine load has long been implicated in AD and proposed to facilitate neurodegeneration. In this issue we discuss key receptor systems of innate immunity that detect Abeta, drive pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production and influence Abeta aggregation and clearance.

Our works emphasized the interest of hippocampal subfield volumetry in early diagnosis and the need for further development in this field including optimization, standardization, and automatization of the techniques. Also, we conducted several studies in cognitively intact at-risk elderly (e.g., subjective cognitive decline patients and APOE4 carriers) to better identify biomarkers associated with increased risk of developing AD. Regarding the physiopathological mechanisms, specific multimodal neuroimaging techniques allowed us to highlight the relevance of diaschisis, the mismatch between neurodegeneration and local Abeta deposition and the regional variation in the mechanisms underlying structural or functional alterations. Further works integrating other biomarkers known to play a role in the physiopathology of AD (tau, TDP-43, inflammation, etc.) in a longitudinal design would be useful to get a comprehensive understanding of their relative role, sequence, and causal relationships. Our works also highlighted the relevance of functional connectivity in further understanding the specificity of cognitive deficits in AD and how connectivity differentially influences the propagation of the different AD biomarkers. Finally, we conducted several studies on the links between lifestyle factors and neuroimaging biomarkers to unravel mechanisms of reserve.

Although depression in AD is primarily treated with antidepressants, there are few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing efficacy and results have been conflicting. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review evidence on efficacy of antidepressant treatments for depression in AD. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of double blind RCTs comparing antidepressants versus placebo for depression in AD. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and on line national and international registers. Primary outcomes were treatment response and depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes were cognition, acceptability, and tolerability. Risk of bias was also assessed. RESULTS: Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Three compared sertraline with placebo; one compared both sertraline and mirtazapine to placebo; imipramine, fluoxetine, and clomipramine were evaluated in one study each. In terms of response to treatment (6 studies, 297 patients treated with antidepressants and 223 with placebo), no statistically significant difference between antidepressants and placebo was found (odds ratio (OR) 1.95, 95% CI 0.97-3.92). We found no significant drug-placebo difference for depressive symptoms (5 studies, 311 patients, SMD -0.13; 95% CI -0.49 to 0.24). Overall quality of the evidence was moderate because of methodological limitations in studies and the small number of trials. CONCLUSION: Despite the importance of depression in people with AD, few RCTs are available on efficacy of antidepressants, limiting clear conclusions of their potential role.

Kirtan Kriya meditation has been shown to mitigate the deleterious effects of chronic stress on cognition, reverse memory loss, and create psychological and spiritual wellbeing, which may reduce multiple drivers of Alzheimer's disease risk. OBJECTIVE: To detail a new concept in medicine called Spiritual Fitness, a merging of stress reduction, basic wellbeing, and psycho/spiritual wellbeing to prevent Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The literature on the topics mentioned above is described, including an in-depth discussion on why and how each are critical to advancing the future of Alzheimer's disease prevention. The many negative effects of chronic stress, and the benefits of Kirtan Kriya, are reviewed. The four pillars of basic wellbeing, six practical aspects of psychological wellbeing, and the four new non-sectarian features of spiritual fitness are then disclosed. Moreover, instructions on practicing Kirtan Kriya are offered in the Supplementary Material. CONCLUSION: Religious and spiritual practices, including Kirtan Kriya, are crucial components in the development of enhanced cognition and well-being, which may help prevent and, in some cases, reverse cognitive decline. The key point of this review is that making a commitment to live a brain longevity lifestyle including spiritual fitness is a critically important way for aging Alzheimer's disease free. We hope that this article will inspire scientists, clinicians, and patients to embrace this new concept of spiritual fitness and make it a part of every multidomain program for the prevention of cognitive disability.",,"['Khalsa, Dharma Singh', 'Newberg, Andrew B']","['Khalsa DS', 'Newberg AB']","[""Alzheimer's Research and Prevention Foundation, Tucson, AZ, USA."", 'Department of Integrative Medicine and Nutritional Sciences, Department of Radiology, Marcus Institute of Integrative Health, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*prevention & control/psychology', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Love', 'Meditation', '*Spirituality']",PMC8075383,,2021/02/09 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2021/02/08 08:45'],"['2021/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/02/08 08:45 [entrez]']","['JAD201433 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-201433 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2021;80(2):505-519. doi: 10.3233/JAD-201433.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease prevention"", 'kirtan kriya meditation', 'neurotheology', 'peace of mind', 'psychological well-being', 'purpose in life', 'spiritual fitness', 'spiritual well-being', 'spiritual/religious involvement', 'unlimited love']","[""Authors' disclosures available online"", '(https://www.j-alz.com/manuscript-disclosures/20-1433r1).']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importantly, aging is also the primary risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. As such, there is an urgent need to provide a greater understanding of both the pathogenesis and treatment of these devastating neurodegenerative disorders. One of the key cellular processes that becomes dysregulated with age and participates both directly and indirectly in age-related dysfunction, is metal homeostasis and the neurochemistry of metalloproteins, the basic science of which has been extensively reviewed in the past.

These studies have found subtle yet detectable differences in driving associated with AD biomarker status among cognitively intact older adults.

Currently, drug treatments target the symptoms of the disease and do not modify or halt the disease progress. Thus, natural compounds have been investigated for their ability to treat AD. This review examines the efficacy of curcumin, a polyphenol derived from turmeric herb, to treat AD. We summarize the in vivo and in vitro research describing the mechanisms of action in which curcumin modifies AD pathology: curcumin inhibits the formation and promotes the disaggregation of amyloid-beta plaques, attenuates the hyperphosphorylation of tau and enhances its clearance, binds copper, lowers cholesterol, modifies microglial activity, inhibits acetylcholinesterase, mediates the insulin signaling pathway, and is an antioxidant. In conclusion, curcumin has the potential to be more efficacious than current treatments. However, its usefulness as a therapeutic agent may be hindered by its low bioavailability.

Together with axons, myelin is a prerequisite for the higher functions of the central nervous system and complex forms of network integration. Myelin impairments have been suggested to lead to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. Accumulating evidence, including brain imaging and postmortem and genetic association studies, has implicated myelin impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

So Israel and Lavine have proposed a $3 billion state bonding initiative to secure sufficient funding to tackle this disease. It would be similar to the bonding initiatives that have made California and Texas this nation's centers for stem cell and cancer research. The bond would provide a dedicated funding stream to support research to find effective means to treat, cure, and eventually prevent Alzheimer's, and fund programs to help people currently dealing with Alzheimer's and their caregivers.

This has led to hypothesize that there could be a common biological mechanism, deregulated in opposite directions that might explain the phenomenon of mutual protection. The immunological system and its regulatory checkpoints are good candidates to explain why having survived a cancer could protect from developing AD. During cancerous growth, the neoplastic cells induce immune tolerance to block the host's immunity system that would prevent tumor growth. This has led to the development of drugs that block distinct immune checkpoints, such as Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) and its major ligand PD-L1, that have shown great promise in treating diverse types of cancer.

AF is a major risk factor for stroke, and stroke is the greatest risk factor for vascular dementia. However, the relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, and AF remains unclear. At least four epidemiological studies have reported AF significantly raises the risk of AD 1.5- to 2.5-fold. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, resulting from persistent AF, could explain the link as hypoperfusion may mechanistically exacerbate amyloid-beta (Abeta) neuropathology, such as senile plaques and amyloid angiopathy, by upregulating Abeta-producing enzymes and lowering Abeta clearance efficiency. In addition, hypoperfusion may exacerbate tau pathology directly through upregulation of tau-phosphorylating enzymes and indirectly via the amyloid cascade. However, most neuropathological studies do not support the direct link between AD pathology and AF but rather suggests vascular neuropathology is related to, or coexistent with, AF and lowers the threshold for clinically-evident AD. Vascular neuropathology may thus mediate the link between AD and AF. From a treatment perspective, an observational study has shown that catheter ablation is associated with less incidence of AD in AF patients, suggesting rhythm-control suppresses hypoperfusion-induced AD neuropathology. In addition, rate-control may lower the rate of cognitive decline in cognitively impaired elderly subjects with AF. Further studies are warranted to clarify the mechanisms underlying the linkage between AF and AD.

An Approach from Emotional Sensorial Stimulation.,505-521,10.3233/JAD-200408 [doi],"Alzheimer's disease (AD) provides a valuable field of research into impairment of self-consciousness (SC), because AD patients have a reduced capacity to understand their mental world, to experience and relive previous personal events, as well as to interpret thoughts, feelings, and beliefs about themselves. Several studies observed that AD patients had an altered SC, but not a complete abolition of it. Emotions are an integral part of the construction of personal identity, therefore of Self. In general, most studies on emotion in AD patients have observed that emotion is not completely abolished and it lets them better remember autobiographical events with greater emotional charge. The positive effect of autobiographical memories rich in emotional content, evoked directly/automatically by sensorial stimuli such as familiar odors or music, could be used to reestablish/reinforce the permanence and coherence of the Self in AD. We studied the research of empirical evidence supporting the power of the sensorial cues associated with emotion, which could be capable of enhancing the SC in AD. We presented the studies about ""Emotional stimulations"" using odor, music, or taste cues in AD. All studies have shown to have a positive impact on SC in AD patients such as odor-evoked autobiographical memories, taste/odor-evoked autobiographical memories, emotional sensorial stimulation using musical cues, and multi-sensorial stimulations using healing gardens. We found research supporting the notion that emotional sensorial stimulations can even temporarily exalt memory, affective state, and personal identity, that is, the SC in AD.

Recent research has suggested a potential association between certain infectious diseases and dementia, either directly due to bacterial brain invasion and toxin production, or indirectly by modulating the immune response. Therefore, in the present review we focus on the emerging issues of bacterial infection and AD, including the existence of antimicrobial peptides having pore-forming properties that act in a similar way to pores formed by Abeta in a variety of cell membranes. Special focus is placed on oral bacteria and biofilms, and on the potential mechanisms associating bacterial infection and toxin production in AD. The role of bacterial outer membrane vesicles on the transport and delivery of toxins as well as porins to the brain is also discussed. Abeta has shown to possess antimicrobial activity against several bacteria, and therefore could be upregulated as a response to bacteria and bacterial toxins in the brain.

However, clinical studies with active and passive immunotherapy have been disappointing in several aspects, especially lately, when reports analyzing long term result of immunization protocols failed to show improvement in cognitive function and disease progression. Furthermore, some of the active immunotherapy protocols appear to be associated with severe side effects, including brain inflammation and amyloid angiopathy mediated hemorrhage.

Forms of sAD do not exhibit familial aggregation and are characterized by complex genetic and environmental interactions. Recently, the expansion of genomic methodologies, in association with substantially larger combined cohorts, has resulted in various genome-wide association studies that have identified several novel genetic associations of AD. Currently, the most effective methods for establishing the diagnosis of AD are defined by multi-modal pathways, starting with clinical and neuropsychological assessment, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and brain-imaging procedures, all of which have significant cost- and access-to-care barriers. Consequently, research efforts have focused on the development and validation of non-invasive and generalizable blood-based biomarkers. Among the modalities conceptualized by the systems biology paradigm and utilized in the ""exploratory biomarker discovery arena"", proteome analysis has received the most attention. However, metabolomics, lipidomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics have recently become key modalities in the search for AD biomarkers. Interestingly, biomarker changes for familial AD (fAD), in many but not all cases, seem similar to those for sAD. The integration of neurogenetics with systems biology/physiology-based strategies and high-throughput technologies for molecular profiling is expected to help identify the causes, mechanisms, and biomarkers associated with the various forms of AD.

RECENT FINDINGS: Neuroinflammation in AD is an active field of research, with increasing evidence from basic and clinical studies for an involvement of innate or adaptive immune responses in the pathophysiology of AD. Few clinical trials with anti-inflammatory drugs have been performed in the last decade, with negative results. SUMMARY: Besides the information gathered from basic research, epidemiological studies have provided conflicting findings, with most case-control or prevalence studies suggesting an inverse relationship between NSAIDs use and AD, but divided results in prospective population-based incident cohort studies. Clinical trials with different NSAIDs are almost unanimous in reporting an absence of clear benefit in AD. CONCLUSION: The modulation of inflammatory responses is a promising therapeutic strategy in AD. After three decades of research, it seems that conventional NSAIDs are not the best pharmacological option, both for their lack of clear effects and for an unfavorable side-effect profile in long-term treatment. The development of other anti-inflammatory drugs as candidate treatments in AD may benefit from the knowledge acquired with NSAIDs.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Villarejo-Galende, Alberto', 'Gonzalez-Sanchez, Marta', 'Blanco-Palmero, Victor A', 'Llamas-Velasco, Sara', 'Benito-Leon, Julian']","['Villarejo-Galende A', 'Gonzalez-Sanchez M', 'Blanco-Palmero VA', 'Llamas-Velasco S', 'Benito-Leon J']","['Department of Neurology, University ""12 de Octubre"", Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Complutense University, Madrid, Group of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Imas12, Biomedical Research Networking Center in Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Neurology, University ""12 de Octubre"", Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Complutense University, Madrid, Group of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Imas12, Biomedical Research Networking Center in Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Neurology, University ""12 de Octubre"", Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Complutense University, Madrid, Group of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Imas12, Biomedical Research Networking Center in Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Neurology, University ""12 de Octubre"", Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Complutense University, Madrid, Group of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Imas12, Biomedical Research Networking Center in Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Neurology, University ""12 de Octubre"", Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Complutense University, Madrid, Group of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Imas12, Biomedical Research Networking Center in Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['R01 NS039422/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Alzheimer Res,Current Alzheimer research,101208441,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*drug therapy/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Brain/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*drug therapy']",,,2020/11/28 06:00,2021/11/05 06:00,['2020/11/27 12:07'],"['2020/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/27 12:07 [entrez]']","['CAR-EPUB-111922 [pii]', '10.2174/1567205017666201127163018 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Alzheimer Res. 2020;17(11):1013-1022. doi: 10.2174/1567205017666201127163018.,['NOTNLM'],"['Alzheimer s disease', 'NSAIDs', 'amyloid', 'anti-inflammatory drugs', 'clinical trials', 'risk']",,,,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms which make the neurons involved in learning and memory particularly vulnerable to the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles remain completely unknown. Here, I propose a hypothesis that may resolve this puzzle. A growing body of evidence suggests that memory formation involves epigenetic mechanisms that regulate patterns of gene expression. Therefore, it is conceivable that the process of memory consolidation may include the synthesis of novel proteins that are recognized by the immune system as ""non-self"" antigens. Normally, neurons involved in formation and storage of memory are isolated from the organism's immune system by the blood-brain barrier. Since all known genetic and environmental risk factors for Alzheimer's disease can compromise this barrier, I hypothesize that the disease is initiated as an autoimmune reaction against the memory-bearing neurons. This reaction gradually makes these neurons vulnerable to the subsequent formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. This hypothesis suggests that early therapy of Alzheimer's disease could be devoted to preventing impairments in the blood-brain barrier. Recent evidence that formation of the blood-brain barrier is controlled via the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway may suggest potential directions to addressing this problem.",,"['Arshavsky, Yuri I']",['Arshavsky YI'],"['BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0402, USA. yarshavs@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*complications/pathology/therapy', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Memory Disorders/*etiology/*physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Models, Biological', '*Neurophysiology', 'Risk Factors']",,,2010/04/10 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2010/04/10 06:00'],"['2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['L57063610Q860783 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-2009-1339 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2010;20(1):5-16. doi: 10.3233/JAD-2009-1339.,,,,,,,,,,,,180,,,,,,,,,,

Episodic memory decline was observed to be the most salient cognitive function, correlating with high levels of amyloid deposition and hypoconnectivity across large-scale brain networks.

Ongoing advances in the knowledge of pathogenesis, in the identification of novel targets, in improved outcome measures, and in identification and validation of biomarkers may lead to effective strategies for AD prevention.

It is now widely accepted that neuroinflammation is implicated in AD pathogenesis. METHOD: Indeed, inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) can impact on the Alzheimer s amyloid precursor protein by affecting its expression levels and amyloidogenic processing and/or beta -amyloid aggregation. Additionally, cytokines and chemokines can influence kinases' activities, leading to abnormal TAU phosphorylation. To date there is no cure for AD, but several therapeutic strategies have been directed to prevent neuroinflammation. Anti-inflammatory, but also anti-amyloidogenic compounds, such as flavonoids were shown to favourably modulate some pathological events associated with neurodegeneration. CONCLUSION: This review focuses on the role of cytokines and chemokines in AD-associated pathologies, and summarizes the potential anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing or slowing down disease progression.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Domingues, Catarina', 'da Cruz E Silva, Odete A B', 'Henriques, Ana Gabriela']","['Domingues C', 'da Cruz E Silva OAB', 'Henriques AG']","['Neurosciences and Signalling Laboratory, Department of Medical Sciences and Institute of Biomedicine - iBiMED, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal.', 'Neurosciences and Signalling Laboratory, Department of Medical Sciences and Institute of Biomedicine - iBiMED, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal.', 'Neurosciences and Signalling Laboratory, Department of Medical Sciences and Institute of Biomedicine - iBiMED, University of Aveiro, P.O.

Specifically, AD is now divided into three stages: preclinical (abnormal biomarkers and no or only subtle cognitive impairment), mild cognitive impairment or prodromal AD (abnormal pathophysiological biomarkers and episodic memory impairment), and dementia (abnormal biomarkers and clear cognitive and functional impairment). The possibility of assessing AD pathophysiology in vivo before the onset of clinical symptoms in the preclinical stage provides the unprecedented opportunity to intervene at earlier stages of the continuum in secondary prevention trials. Currently, large cohort studies of cognitively healthy participants are undergoing with the main aim of disentangling the natural history of AD to identify individuals with an increased risk of developing AD in the near future to be recruited in these clinical trials.

Currently available drugs can only improve cognitive symptoms, have no impact on progression and are not curative, so identifying and studying new drug targets is important. There are evidences which indicate disturbances in cholesterol homeostasis can be related with AD pathology, especially the compartmentation of intracellular cholesterol and cytoplasmic cholesterol esters formed by acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) can be implicated in the regulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, involved in AD. Blocking ACAT1 activity, beneficial effects are obtained, so it has been suggested that ACAT1 can be a potential new therapeutic target. The present review discusses the role of cholesterol homeostasis in AD pathology, especially with ACAT inhibitors, and how they have been raised as a therapeutic approach. In addition, the genetic relationship of ACAT and AD is discussed. CONCLUSION: Although there are several lines of evidence from cell-based and animal studies that suggest that ACAT inhibition is an effective way of reducing cerebral Abeta, there is still an information gap in terms of mechanisms and concerns to cover before passing to the next level. Additionally, an area of interest that may be useful in understanding AD to subsequently propose new therapeutic approaches is pharmacogenetics; however, there is still a lot of missing information in this area.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Alavez-Rubio, Jessica Sarahi', 'Juarez-Cedillo, Teresa']","['Alavez-Rubio JS', 'Juarez-Cedillo T']","['Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Epidemiologica y en Servicios de Salud, Area Envejecimiento, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Actualmente comisionada en la Unidad de Investigacion en Epidemiologia, Clinica, Hospital Regional, Num. 1 Dr. Carlos MacGregor Sanchez Navarro IMSS), Mexico.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Alzheimer Res,Current Alzheimer research,101208441,IM,"['Acetyl-CoA C-Acetyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Alzheimer Disease/*genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Humans']",,,2019/08/24 06:00,2020/10/07 06:00,['2019/08/24 06:00'],"['2019/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['CAR-EPUB-100430 [pii]', '10.2174/1567205016666190823125245 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Alzheimer Res. 2019;16(8):699-709. doi: 10.2174/1567205016666190823125245.,['NOTNLM'],"['Alzheimer s disease', 'cholesterol metabolism', 'cholesteryl esters', 'inhibiting ACAT1', 'pharmacogenetics', 'therapeutic target.']",,,,"['97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.3.1.9 (Acetyl-CoA C-Acetyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present causality analysis evaluates the extent to which the routine, life-long intake, and metabolism of aluminum compounds can account for Alzheimer's disease (AD), using Austin Bradford Hill's nine epidemiological and experimental causality criteria, including strength of the relationship, consistency, specificity, temporality, dose-dependent response, biological rationale, coherence with existing knowledge, experimental evidence, and analogy. Mechanisms that underlie the risk of low concentrations of aluminum relate to (1) aluminum's absorption rates, allowing the impression that aluminum is safe to ingest and as an additive in food and drinking water treatment, (2) aluminum's slow progressive uptake into the brain over a long prodromal phase, and (3) aluminum's similarity to iron, in terms of ionic size, allows aluminum to use iron-evolved mechanisms to enter the highly-active, iron-dependent cells responsible for memory processing. Aluminum particularly accumulates in these iron-dependent cells to toxic levels, dysregulating iron homeostasis and causing microtubule depletion, eventually producing changes that result in disconnection of neuronal afferents and efferents, loss of function and regional atrophy consistent with MRI findings in AD brains. AD is a human form of chronic aluminum neurotoxicity.

The arc of scientific progress is now requiring a change in how we diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Both the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) 2011 workgroup and the International Work Group (IWG) have proposed guidelines that use detectable measures of biological changes in the brain, commonly known as biological markers, or biomarkers, as part of the diagnosis. This Special Report examines how the development and validation of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers-including those detectable in the blood or cerebral spinal fluid, or through neuroimaging-is a top research priority. This has the potential to markedly change how we diagnose Alzheimer's disease and, as a result, how we count the number of people with this disease. As research advances a biomarker-based method for diagnosis and treatment at the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease, we envision a future in which Alzheimer's disease is placed in the same category as other chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, which can be readily identified with biomarkers and treated before irrevocable disability occurs.","[""Copyright (c) 2017 the Alzheimer's Association.

However, recent multi-year AD studies have lost 10% to 54% of participants. OBJECTIVE: We surveyed a random sample of 443 participants (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR]</=1) at four Alzheimer Disease Research Centers to elucidate perceived facilitators and barriers to continued participation in longitudinal AD research. METHODS: Reasons for participation were characterized with factor analysis. Effects of perceived fulfillment of one's own goals and complaints on attendance and likelihood of dropout were estimated with logistic regression models. Open-ended responses suggesting study improvements were analyzed with a Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model. RESULTS: Factor analyses revealed two categories, personal benefit and altruism, as drivers of continued participation. Participants with cognitive impairment (CDR > 0) emphasized personal benefits more than societal benefits. Participants with higher trust in medical researchers were more likely to emphasize broader social benefits. A minority endorsed any complaints. Higher perceived fulfillment of one's own goals and fewer complaints were related to higher attendance and lower likelihood of dropout. Facilitators included access to medical center support and/or future treatment, learning about AD and memory concerns, and enjoying time with staff. Participants' suggestions emphasized more feedback about individual test results and AD research. CONCLUSION: The results confirmed previously identified facilitators and barriers. Two new areas, improved communication about individual test results and greater feedback about AD research, emerged as the primary factors to improve participation.",,"['Gabel, Matthew', 'Bollinger, Rebecca M', 'Coble, Dean W', 'Grill, Joshua D', 'Edwards, Dorothy F', 'Lingler, Jennifer H', 'Chin, Erin', 'Stark, Susan L']","['Gabel M', 'Bollinger RM', 'Coble DW', 'Grill JD', 'Edwards DF', 'Lingler JH', 'Chin E', 'Stark SL']","['Department of Political Science, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'School of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'School of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders, Departments of Psychiatry & Human Behavior and Neurobiology & Behavior, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', ""Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA."", 'School of Nursing, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', ""Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."", 'School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'School of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 AG066468/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AG066519/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AG016976/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 AG072122/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['*Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/psychology/therapy', '*Cognitive Dysfunction/psychology', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mental Status and Dementia Tests']",PMC9673904,['NIHMS1814912'],2022/04/12 06:00,2022/05/25 06:00,['2022/04/11 12:14'],"['2022/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/25 06:00 [medline]', '2022/04/11 12:14 [entrez]']","['JAD215710 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-215710 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2022;87(2):945-955. doi: 10.3233/JAD-215710.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'barriers', 'facilitators', 'retention']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The morphological alterations consisted of considerable changes of the mitochondrial cristae, accumulation of osmiophilic material, and decrease of their size, in comparison with the normal controls. Mitochondrial alterations were particularly prominent in neurons, which showed loss of dendritic spines and abbreviation of the dendritic arborization. The ultrastructural study of large number of neurons in the thalamus and the red nucleus revealed that the mitochondrial alterations did not coexist with cytoskeletal pathology and accumulation of amyloid deposits, though they were prominent in neurons, which demonstrated fragmentation of the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus.

It proposed that the brain damage leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD) was instigated by soluble, ligand-like AbetaOs. This hypothesis was based on the discovery that fibril-free synthetic preparations of AbetaOs were potent CNS neurotoxins that rapidly inhibited long-term potentiation and, with time, caused selective nerve cell death (Lambert et al., 1998). The mechanism was attributed to disrupted signaling involving the tyrosine-protein kinase Fyn, mediated by an unknown toxin receptor. Over 4,000 articles concerning AbetaOs have been published since then, including more than 400 reviews. AbetaOs have been shown to accumulate in an AD-dependent manner in human and animal model brain tissue and, experimentally, to impair learning and memory and instigate major facets of AD neuropathology, including tau pathology, synapse deterioration and loss, inflammation, and oxidative damage. As reviewed by Hayden and Teplow in 2013, the AbetaO hypothesis ""has all but supplanted the amyloid cascade."" Despite the emerging understanding of the role played by AbetaOs in AD pathogenesis, AbetaOs have not yet received the clinical attention given to amyloid plaques, which have been at the core of major attempts at therapeutics and diagnostics but are no longer regarded as the most pathogenic form of Abeta. However, if the momentum of AbetaO research continues, particularly efforts to elucidate key aspects of structure, a clear path to a successful disease modifying therapy can be envisioned. Ensuring that lessons learned from recent, late-stage clinical failures are applied appropriately throughout therapeutic development will further enable the likelihood of a successful therapy in the near-term.",,"['Cline, Erika N', 'Bicca, Maira Assuncao', 'Viola, Kirsten L', 'Klein, William L']","['Cline EN', 'Bicca MA', 'Viola KL', 'Klein WL']","[""Department of Neurobiology, Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center, International Institute for Nanotechnology, and Chemistry of Life Processes Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA."", ""Department of Neurobiology, Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center, International Institute for Nanotechnology, and Chemistry of Life Processes Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA."", ""Department of Neurobiology, Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center, International Institute for Nanotechnology, and Chemistry of Life Processes Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA."", ""Department of Neurobiology, Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center, International Institute for Nanotechnology, and Chemistry of Life Processes Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.""]",['eng'],"['R41 AG054337/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AG020506/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/*metabolism/therapy', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Models, Neurological']",PMC6004937,,2018/05/31 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD179941 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-179941 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2018;64(s1):S567-S610. doi: 10.3233/JAD-179941.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'amyloid-beta peptide', 'diagnostics', 'etiology', 'model systems', 'oligomers', 'prions', 'receptors', 'structure-function', 'tau', 'therapeutics']",,,,['0 (Amyloid beta-Peptides)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, there are limited pharmacological interventions, and this has heightened the urgency to identify potential preventable or modifiable risk factors that promote resilience to the neuropathological effects of AD. The regular use of two or more languages is one such factor that may increases cognitive reserve through the long-standing executive control involved in managing multiple languages in the brain. There is also evidence that bilingualism is associated with increased brain reserve or maintenance, particularly in frontal-executive structures and networks. This review examines the current, sometimes conflicting literature on bi/multilingualism and AD. These studies have confounding variations in the assessment of age of second language onset, language proficiency, language usage, and whether determining incidence of AD or age of symptom onset. Despite these limitations, most publications support the presence of increased frontal-executive reserve that compensates for the development of AD neuropathology and, thereby, delays the emergence of clinical symptoms of dementia by about 4-5 years. Although regularly speaking more than one language does not protect against AD neuropathology, the delay in its clinical expression has a potentially significant impact on the lifelong morbidity from this age-related disease.

Pathological hallmarks include amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyper-phosphorylated tau protein. Evidence suggests that both pathologies are self-propagating once established. However, the lag time between neuropathological changes in the brain and the onset of even subtle clinical symptomatology means that patients are often diagnosed late when pathology, and neurodegeneration secondary to these changes, may have been established for several years. Complex pathological pathways associated with susceptibility to AD and changes that occur downstream of the neuropathologic process further contribute to the challenging endeavour of developing novel disease-modifying therapy. Recognising this complexity, effective management of AD must include reliable screening and early diagnosis in combination with effective therapeutic management of the pathological processes. Roche and Genentech are committed to addressing these unmet needs through developing a comprehensive portfolio of diagnostics and novel therapies. Beginning with the most scientifically supported targets, this approach includes two targeted amyloid-beta monoclonal antibody therapies, crenezumab and gantenerumab, and an anti-tau monoclonal antibody, RO7105705, as well as a robust biomarker platform to aid in the early identification of people at risk or in the early stages of AD.

As a result of this growing understanding, several research efforts have launched or will be launching large secondary prevention trials in AD. These and other efforts have clearly demonstrated a need for better measures of cognitive and functional change in people with the earliest changes associated with AD. Recent draft guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration further elevated the importance of cognitive and functional assessments in early stage clinical trials by proposing that even in the pre-symptomatic stages of the disease, approval will be contingent on demonstrating clinical meaningfulness.

Besides the extensive neuron-oriented research, an increasing body of evidence suggests that glial cells, namely astrocytes, microglia, NG2 glia and oligodendrocytes, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. In the first part of this review, AD pathophysiology in humans is briefly described and compared with disease progression in routinely used animal models. The relevance of findings obtained in animal models of AD is also discussed with respect to AD pathology in humans. Further, this review summarizes recent findings regarding the role/participation of glial cells in pathogenesis of AD, focusing on changes in their morphology, functions, proteins and gene expression profiles. As for astrocytes and microglia, they are fundamental for the progression and outcome of AD either because they function as effector cells releasing cytokines that play a role in neuroprotection, or because they fail to fulfill their homeostatic functions, ultimately leaving neurons to face excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Next, we turn our attention towards NG2 glia, a novel and distinct class of glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), whose role in a variety of human CNS diseases has begun to emerge, and we also consider the participation of oligodendrocytes in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Since AD is currently an incurable disease, in the last part of our review we hypothesize about possible glia-oriented treatments and provide a perspective of possible future advancements in this field.",,"['Dzamba, David', 'Harantova, Lenka', 'Butenko, Olena', 'Anderova, Miroslava']","['Dzamba D', 'Harantova L', 'Butenko O', 'Anderova M']","['Department of Cellular Neurophysiology, Institute of Experimental Medicine, AS CR, Videnska 1083, 142 00 Prague 4, Czech Republic. anderova@biomed.cas.cz.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Alzheimer Res,Current Alzheimer research,101208441,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/drug therapy/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Neuroglia/drug effects/pathology/*physiology']",,,2016/01/31 06:00,2017/10/03 06:00,['2016/01/31 06:00'],"['2015/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['CAR-EPUB-73332 [pii]', '10.2174/1567205013666160129095924 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Alzheimer Res. 2016;13(8):894-911. doi: 10.2174/1567205013666160129095924.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Greater use of unbiased ""omics"" approaches is being increasingly recognized as essential for the future development of effective AD research, that need to better reflect the multiple distinct pathway abnormalities that can drive AD pathology. The track record of success in AD clinical trials thus far has been very poor. In part, this high failure rate has been related to the premature translation of highly successful results in animal models that mirror only limited aspects of AD pathology to humans. We highlight our recent efforts to increase use of human tissue to gain a better understanding of the AD pathogenesis subtype variety and to develop several distinct therapeutic approaches tailored to address this diversity. These therapeutic approaches include the blocking of the Abeta/apoE interaction, stimulation of innate immunity, and the simultaneous blocking of Abeta/tau oligomer toxicity.

In this article, we review the role of GSH in AD from a pathological as well as a diagnostic point of view. We recapitulate the literature that has assessed the role of GSH in AD onset and progression. We discuss the various methodologies through which alterations in GSH levels might be monitored, and highlight the yet uncharted potential of assaying GSH levels in vivo with magnetic resonance spectroscopy in AD therapeutics and prognostics.

Increased knowledge gained during the past 25 years indicates that AD falls along a clinical and neuropathological spectrum represented as a continuum that extends from preclinical disease in which there are no symptoms, through early symptomatic phases, and finally to AD dementia. The Alzheimer's research community recognizes that imaging, body fluids, and cognitive biomarkers contribute to enhanced diagnostic confidence for AD. There has also been emerging consensus regarding the use of AD biomarkers in clinical trials. The use of biomarkers in clinical trials and practice is hampered by the lack of standardization. In response to the emerging need for standardization, an international meeting of AD researchers was held in Melbourne, Australia, in March 2012 to bring together key researchers, clinicians, industry, and regulatory stakeholders with the aim of generating consensus on standardization and validation of cognitive, imaging, and fluid biomarkers, as well as lifestyle parameters used in research centers worldwide.","[""Copyright (c) 2013 The Alzheimer's Association.

METHODS: Literature review, consensus meetings, and a retrospective chart review of patients with probable AD were conducted. RESULTS: Literature review showed that RCD definitions varied. Mini-Mental State Examination scores <20 at treatment onset, vascular risk factors, age <70 years at symptom onset, higher education levels, and early appearance of hallucinations, psychosis, or extrapyramidal symptoms are recognized RCD risk factors. Chart review showed that RCD (Mini-Mental State Examination score decline >/=3 points/year) is more common in moderate (43.2%) than in mild patients (20.1%; P < .001). Rapid and slow decliners had similar age, gender, and education levels at baseline. DISCUSSION: RCD is sufficiently common to interfere with randomized clinical trials. We propose a 6-month prerandomization determination of the decline rate or use of an RCD risk score to ensure balanced allocation among treatment groups.","[""Copyright (c) 2017 the Alzheimer's Association.

Often overlooked however, is how the loss of neuronal innervation of blood vessels, termed perivascular innervation, may also contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. There is now considerable evidence supporting a crucial role for the neurovascular unit (NVU) in mediating the clearance of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide, one of the main pathological constituents of AD, from the brain. Moreover, efficient removal appears to be dependent on the communication of cells within the NVU to maintain adequate vascular tone and pulsatility. This review summarizes the composition of the NVU, including the sources of perivascular innervation and how the NVU mediates Abeta clearance from the brain. It also explores evidence supporting the hypothesis that loss of neurally mediated vasoreactivity contributes to Abeta pathology in the AD brain.","['(c) 2017 The Author(s); published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the', 'Biochemical Society.']","['Nizari, Shereen', 'Romero, Ignacio A', 'Hawkes, Cheryl A']","['Nizari S', 'Romero IA', 'Hawkes CA']","['School of Life, Health and Chemical Sciences, Faculty of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, The Open University, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA, U.K.', 'School of Life, Health and Chemical Sciences, Faculty of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, The Open University, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA, U.K.', 'School of Life, Health and Chemical Sciences, Faculty of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, The Open University, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA, U.K. cheryl.hawkes@open.ac.uk.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Clin Sci (Lond),"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blood Vessels/*innervation', 'Brain/*blood supply/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', '*Hemodynamics', 'Humans', '*Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurons/pathology', '*Neurovascular Coupling', '*Plaque, Amyloid']",,,2017/06/02 06:00,2017/08/29 06:00,['2017/06/02 06:00'],"['2016/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['CS20160769 [pii]', '10.1042/CS20160769 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Sci (Lond). 2017 Jun 1;131(12):1207-1214. doi: 10.1042/CS20160769.,['NOTNLM'],"['Alzheimers disease', 'blood vessel', 'innervation', 'vasoreactivity']",,,,['0 (Amyloid beta-Peptides)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While a myriad of different disease risk factors contribute to AD, these ultimately converge to a common disease outcome. Based on decades of research, a picture emerges where upstream risk factors combine in a feedforward pathophysiological cycle, culminating in a rise of cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+) ](c) ) that triggers neurodegeneration. In this framework, positive AD risk factors entail conditions, characteristics, or lifestyles that initiate or accelerate self-reinforcing cycles of pathophysiology, whereas negative risk factors or therapeutic interventions, particularly those mitigating elevated [Ca(2+) ](c) , oppose these effects and therefore have neuroprotective potential.","[""(c) 2023 reMYND N.V and The Authors.

After clarifying the different kind of musical memories, we investigated their alterations throughout AD's progression from mild to severe stages. Both procedural and retrograde semantic memory seem relatively spared in AD, while episodic memory appears to be impaired early. Moreover, partial preservation of music encoding in AD can be revealed through paradigms that are especially designed for AD patients (relying on behavioral cues, using adapted settings, etc.). Although seldomly used, they would definitely help understanding the preserved capacities in every stage of AD. However, more research is needed to better understand this phenomenon and assess its specificity to music or other types of supports. These findings could lead to multiple applications in care settings and research designs, bringing more nuanced understanding of how long-term musical memory degrades throughout the course of AD, and should encourage us to prioritize patients' preserved cognitive abilities in current AD recreational and care programs.",,"['Groussard, Mathilde', 'Chan, Tyler G', 'Coppalle, Renaud', 'Platel, Herve']","['Groussard M', 'Chan TG', 'Coppalle R', 'Platel H']","['Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, PSL Research University, EPHE, INSERM, CHU de Caen, Cyceron, Caen, France.', 'The Grossman Institute for Neuroscience, Quantitative Biology, and Human Behavior, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, PSL Research University, EPHE, INSERM, CHU de Caen, Cyceron, Caen, France.', 'Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, PSL Research University, EPHE, INSERM, CHU de Caen, Cyceron, Caen, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*psychology', 'Brain/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Memory', 'Models, Theoretical', '*Music/psychology', 'Neuroimaging', '*Retention, Psychology']",,,2019/03/19 06:00,2020/08/28 06:00,['2019/03/19 06:00'],"['2019/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD180474 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-180474 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2019;68(3):857-883. doi: 10.3233/JAD-180474.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'care', 'memory', 'music', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very few species spontaneously develop the cognitive, behavioral, and neuropathological symptoms of AD, yet AD research must progress at a more rapid pace than the rate of human aging. In recent years, a variety of models have been created--from tiny invertebrates with life spans measurable in months to huge mammals that live several decades. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a powerful genetic tool that has recently emerged as a model of AD with neural features and assessable learning and memory. Transgenic mice are the most widely used animal models of AD and have yielded significant research breakthroughs. Accelerated aging seen in the SAMP8 mouse is a non-transgenic model with great utility. Rat models provided early evidence about the deleterious impact of amyloid-beta (Abeta) on neurons and continue to provide insights. Rabbits, as langomorphs, are more closely related to primates than are rodents and have conserved the sequence of Abeta in humans (as have canines and non-human primates). The hypercholesterolemic rabbit is an excellent AD model. The aging canine develops AD neuropathology spontaneously and is especially suitable for tests of therapeutics. Non-human primates are invaluable for the development of therapeutics translating to humans. Each animal model has limitations and strengths, but used together in complementary fashion, animal models for research on AD are essential for rapid progress toward a cure.",,"['Woodruff-Pak, Diana S']",['Woodruff-Pak DS'],"['Department of Psychology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19122, USA. oak@temple.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/genetics/*pathology/*therapy', 'Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Dogs', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Primates', 'Rabbits', 'Rats']",,,2008/12/20 09:00,2009/02/10 09:00,['2008/12/20 09:00'],"['2008/12/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [medline]']",['10.3233/jad-2008-15401 [doi]'],ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2008 Dec;15(4):507-21. doi: 10.3233/jad-2008-15401.,,,,,,,,,,,,65,,,,,,,,,,

The pathological alterations of AD start 30 years before symptoms, and it is essential to develop the capacity to detect those changes. In this regard, molecular biomarkers that detect early pathological manifestations are helpful. Based on markers data, early preventive interventions could reduce more than 40% of AD cases. Protective actions include exercise, shown to induce neurogenesis, cognitive stimulation, intellectual-social activity, and nutrition among others.

These failures in treatment efficacy have led many to believe that symptomatic disease, including both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, may be refractory to therapeutic intervention. The recent focus on biomarkers for defining the preclinical state of MCI/AD is in the hope of defining a therapeutic window in which the neural substrate remains responsive to treatment. The ability of biomarkers to adequately define the at-risk state may ultimately allow novel or repurposed therapeutic agents to finally achieve the disease-modifying status for AD.

There has been growing interest in early diagnosis of this disease, particularly regarding the initiation of new treatment strategies ahead of the onset of irreversible neuronal damage. It is accepted that the pathologic changes underlying AD appear in the brain years to decades before the symptomatic stages. Consequently, clinical measures of cognitive impairment, as used for definition of dementia, will not allow early diagnosis of AD-pathology in the mild or asymptomatic stages. Thus, a need for complementary sensitive biomarkers is apparent. Brain imaging markers are among the most promising candidates for this diagnostic challenge. Particularly, [18F]FDG PET as a marker of regional neuronal function has been demonstrated to represent a most sensitive and specific method for early identification of AD-pathology and thus for prediction of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), even in the mild and asymptomatic stages.

While significant progress has been made in reducing rates of mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular disease over the last thirty years, progress towards effective treatments for AD has been slower. Despite the known association between hypertension and dementia, research into each disease has largely been undertaken in parallel and independently. Yet over the last decade and a half, the emergence of converging findings from pre-clinical and clinical research has shown how the renin angiotensin system (RAS), which is very important in blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular disease, warrants careful consideration in the pathogenesis of AD. Numerous components of the RAS have now been found to be altered in AD such that the multifunctional and potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, and similarly acting angiotensin III, are greatly altered at the expense of other RAS signaling peptides considered to contribute to neuronal and cognitive function. Collectively these changes may contribute to many of the neuropathological hallmarks of AD, as well as observed progressive deficiencies in cognitive function, while also linking elements of a number of the proposed hypotheses for the cause of AD.

To limit this impending socio-medical calamity, a fulcrum change from how AD is presently managed is crucial. The present approach has not averted the stress of AD on medical resources nor reduced the already cost-strained government health care programs. Since substantial evidence indicates that sporadic AD is directly associated with vascular risk factors, a strategic plan is proposed to target this association and markedly reduce the onset of AD. This plan would establish in-house heart-brain clinics devoted to identifying, detecting, and preventing the progression of vascular risk factors that predispose to cognitive impairment and development of AD. The heart-brain clinics would be staffed with a multidisciplinary group of neurologists, psychologists, neuroradiologists, cardiovascular specialists, and technical personnel Their goal would be to apply and interpret non-invasive, cost-effective multidiagnostic testing of heart and brain function in outpatient asymptomatic and symptomatic patients at risk of dementia. Multidiagnostic testing would permit better risk stratification, medical decision-making, and a tailored intervention of patients at-risk of dementia than the present monotherapeutic approach. Personalized intervention, moreover, should achieve better patient compliance and outcome through periodic follow-up visits to the clinics where the medical plan of action could be monitored and modified as needed.

Pretangle formation marks the beginning of the pathological process and is of particular interest because it is temporally closer to the prevailing conditions that induce the pathological process underlying Alzheimer's disease in contrast to late-stage disease. However, not all pretangles convert into neurofibrillary tangles. We propose that the development of tau lesions in Alzheimer's disease is traceable to differences between early- versus late-maturing oligodendrocytes and to the exceptionally protracted myelination of late-developing portions of the human brain.

Whereas the study of biological markers has mobilized major activity in the field, the development of cognitive markers is largely ignored, despite the unique advantages they may offer. Cognitive markers essentially assess the core clinical feature that biological markers intend to predict. In this respect, cognitive markers expand the foundation of preclinical diagnostics and disease staging in a manner that integrates both physiological and psychological factors. In addition, the cost-effective implementation of cognitive markers makes them remarkably conducive to community-wide screenings, and thereby a vital component of any global blueprint for prevention. Specifically, in the primary care setting, cognitive markers may provide effective gate keeping for more invasive, labor intensive, and expensive procedures. From this perspective, cognitive markers may provide the first step for identifying preclinical treatment recipients in general public. Moreover, the detection of preclinical decline via cognitive markers can increase awareness of AD risk and the motivation for making protective lifestyle changes.

The AddNeuroMed consortium conducted a longitudinal observational cohort study with the aim to discover AD biomarkers. During this study, a broad selection of data modalities was measured including clinical assessments, magnetic resonance imaging, genotyping, transcriptomic profiling, and blood plasma proteomics. Some of the collected data were shared with third-party researchers. However, this data was incomplete, erroneous, and lacking in interoperability. OBJECTIVE: To provide the research community with an accessible, multimodal, patient-level AD cohort dataset. METHODS: We systematically addressed several limitations of the originally shared resources and provided additional unreleased data to enhance the dataset. RESULTS: In this work, we publish and describe ANMerge, a new version of the AddNeuroMed dataset. ANMerge includes multimodal data from 1,702 study participants and is accessible to the research community via a centralized portal. CONCLUSION: ANMerge is an information rich patient-level data resource that can serve as a discovery and validation cohort for data-driven AD research, such as, for example, machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches.",,"['Birkenbihl, Colin', 'Westwood, Sarah', 'Shi, Liu', 'Nevado-Holgado, Alejo', 'Westman, Eric', 'Lovestone, Simon', 'Hofmann-Apitius, Martin']","['Birkenbihl C', 'Westwood S', 'Shi L', 'Nevado-Holgado A', 'Westman E', 'Lovestone S', 'Hofmann-Apitius M']","['Department of Bioinformatics, Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI), Sankt Augustin, Germany.', 'Bonn-Aachen International Center for IT, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universitat Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI), Sankt Augustin, Germany.', 'Bonn-Aachen International Center for IT, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universitat Bonn, Bonn, Germany.']",['eng'],"['MC_PC_17215/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Department of Health (NIHR)/']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Cohort Studies', '*Datasets as Topic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Proteomics']",PMC7902946,,2020/12/09 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2020/12/08 01:02'],"['2020/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/08 01:02 [entrez]']","['JAD200948 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-200948 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2021;79(1):423-431. doi: 10.3233/JAD-200948.,['NOTNLM'],"['AddNeuroMed', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'biomarkers', 'cohort analysis', 'cohort studies', 'data-driven science', 'dataset', 'dementia', 'genome wide association studies', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'multimodal']","[""Authors' disclosures available online"", '(https://www.j-alz.com/manuscript-disclosures/20-0948r2 ).']",,,,['AddNeuroMed Consortium'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The allele epsilon4 of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE epsilon4), is the most prevalent genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, and is expressed in more than half of the AD patients. However, in spite of its genetic prominence, the allele APOE epsilon4 and its corresponding protein product apoE4 have been understudied.

Aging may begin when the rate of damage exceeds the rate of continual repair and turnover. Quality control for damaged mitochondria entails cellular digestion by mitophagy, a specialized kind of autophagy. Insufficient protective autophagy could cause damaged cellular components to accumulate over many years until they affect normal function in the cell. Alternatively, aging could be the result of overactive, pathologic autophagy. Current knowledge supports both hypotheses with conflicting data, depending on which stage of autophagy is examined. To distinguish these opposite hypotheses, two criteria need to be observed. First, is there a buildup of undigested waste that can be removed by stimulation of autophagy? Or second, if autophagy is overactive, does inhibition of autophagy rescue cell, organ and organism demise. Both of these are best determined by rate measures rather than measures at a single time point. Here, we review the generalized process of autophagy, with a focus on the limited information available for neuron mitophagy, aging, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In two mouse models, treatment with rapamycin abolishes the AD pathology and reverses memory deficits. As a working model, we hypothesize that insufficient protective autophagy accelerates both aging and AD pathology, possibly caused by defects in autophagosome fusion with lysosomes.",,"['Barnett, Aaron', 'Brewer, Gregory J']","['Barnett A', 'Brewer GJ']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, USA. abarnett2@siumed.edu']",['eng'],['R01 AG032431/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['*Aging', 'Alzheimer Disease/*pathology/*physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Autophagy/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",PMC3547650,['NIHMS432762'],2011/03/23 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/03/23 06:00'],"['2011/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['A170712756755521 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-2011-101989 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2011;25(3):385-94. doi: 10.3233/JAD-2011-101989.,,,,,,['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and (more proximal to cognitive decline) the death of neuronal and other cells. A systems biology approach seeks to organize these observed variables into pathways that discriminate those that are highly involved (i.e., causative) from those that are more usefully recognized as bystander effects. We review the evidence that iron dysregulation is one of the central causative pathway elements here, as this can cause each of the above effects. In addition, we review the evidence that dormant, non-growing bacteria are a crucial feature of AD, that their growth in vivo is normally limited by a lack of free iron, and that it is this iron dysregulation that is an important factor in their resuscitation. Indeed, bacterial cells can be observed by ultrastructural microscopy in the blood of AD patients. A consequence of this is that the growing cells can shed highly inflammatory components such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS). These too are known to be able to induce (apoptotic and pyroptotic) neuronal cell death. There is also evidence that these systems interact with elements of vitamin D metabolism. This integrative systems approach has strong predictive power, indicating (as has indeed been shown) that both natural and pharmaceutical iron chelators might have useful protective roles in arresting cognitive decline, and that a further assessment of the role of microbes in AD development is more than highly warranted.",,"['Pretorius, Etheresia', 'Bester, Janette', 'Kell, Douglas B']","['Pretorius E', 'Bester J', 'Kell DB']","['Department of Physiology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pretoria, Arcadia, South Africa.', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pretoria, Arcadia, South Africa.', 'School of Chemistry, The University of Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, UK.', 'The Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, The University of Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, UK.', 'Centre for Synthetic Biology of Fine and Speciality Chemicals, The University of Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, UK.']",['eng'],"['BB/L025752/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BB/M017702/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*metabolism/*microbiology/pathology', 'Animals', '*Bacterial Physiological Phenomena', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Systems Biology']",PMC5325058,,2016/06/25 06:00,2018/01/30 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JAD160318 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-160318 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2016 Jun 18;53(4):1237-56. doi: 10.3233/JAD-160318.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'LPS', 'bacteria', 'dormancy', 'dysbiosis', 'eryptosis', 'iron', 'systems biology', 'ultramicroscopy']",,,,['E1UOL152H7 (Iron)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of drug trials in this regard have thus far been disappointing, and non-pharmacological interventions are receiving increased attention. One such intervention is complex cognitive activity. Evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that participation in stimulating mental activities is associated with lowered dementia risk. The introduction of novel and complex cognitive interventions to healthy adults and those with cognitive impairment may represent an efficacious treatment option to improve cognition, lower dementia incidence, and slow rate of decline. This review examines the evidence for restorative cognitive training (CT) and addresses a number of clinically relevant issues regarding cognitive benefit and its transfer and persistence. Although the number of randomized controlled trials is limited, preliminary evidence suggests that CT may provide immediate and longer term cognitive benefits which generalize to non-trained domains and non-cognitive functions, with supervised small group multi-domain training providing greatest benefits. Possible neuroplastic mechanisms are discussed, and recommendations for further research and clinical implementation provided.",,"['Gates, Nicola J', 'Sachdev, Perminder']","['Gates NJ', 'Sachdev P']","['Centre for Healthy Brain Aging (CHeBA), School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia Neuropsychiatric Institute, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia.', 'Centre for Healthy Brain Aging (CHeBA), School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia Neuropsychiatric Institute, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/complications/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Cognition Disorders/etiology/rehabilitation', 'Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/*methods', 'Humans']",,,2014/08/30 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2014/08/30 06:00'],"['2014/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['Y51G3U78XV22482X [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-141302 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2014;42 Suppl 4:S551-9. doi: 10.3233/JAD-141302.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'cognitive intervention', 'cognitive training', 'treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AD is characterized by early cognitive deficits, particularly in short-term memory, followed by a gradual decline in other cognitive functions. Functional imaging studies indicate that hippocampal and medial temporal lobe cortices are the sites of early pathology underlying the initial memory impairments. Behaviors that rely on hippocampal integrity have been the focus of extensive research using animal models and represent useful functional endpoints in pre-clinical AD research. In this review, we argue that relevant information can be derived from studying normal, aging animals performing hippocampal-sensitive tasks. Because age is the greatest risk factor for developing clinical AD, the aspects of cognitive decline occurring in normal, aging animals that resemble those seen in aging humans are reliable endpoints that can be applied to improving human therapies. Ultimately, pre-clinical studies that employ tasks sensitive to hippocampal function can be applied toward novel hypotheses in AD intervention and could provide important insights for developing early detection devices for AD patients.",,"['Britton, Gabrielle B', 'Rao, K S J']","['Britton GB', 'Rao KS']","['Center for Neuroscience, Instituto de Investigaciones Cientificas y Servicios de Alta Tecnologia, Panama, Republica de Panama. gbritton@indicasat.org.pa']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['*Aging', 'Alzheimer Disease/*complications/*diagnosis', 'Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Humans']",,,2011/03/23 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/03/23 06:00'],"['2011/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['P27Q688J4675U7M2 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-2011-110239 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2011;24 Suppl 2:153-9. doi: 10.3233/JAD-2011-110239.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence linking oral bacteria to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is discussed in the context of aging, drawing together data from epidemiological, experimental, genetic, and environmental studies. Immunosenescence results in increased bacterial load as cell-mediated and humoral immune responses wane. The innate immune system gradually takes over; contributing to the rise in circulating proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha. Maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) against a backdrop of increasing bacterial load is important. Aging may favor the proliferation of anaerobes in the mouth eliciting a robust TNFalpha response from the oral epithelium. Prolonged exposure to high levels of circulating TNFalpha compromises the integrity of the BBB. Sensitive techniques now detect the ""asymptomatic"" presence of bacteria in areas previously thought to be sterile, providing new insights into the wider distribution of components of the microbiome. These ""immune-tolerated"" bacteria may slowly multiply elsewhere until they elicit a chronic inflammatory response; some are now considered causal in instances of atherosclerosis and back pain. Inflammatory processes have long been associated with AD. We propose for a subset of AD patients, aging favors the overgrowth of oral anaerobes established earlier in life provoking a pro-inflammatory innate response that weakens the BBB allowing bacteria to spread and quietly influence the pathogenesis of AD. Finally, we suggest that human polymorphisms considered alongside components of the microbiome may provide new avenues of research for the prevention and treatment of disease.",,"['Shoemark, Deborah K', 'Allen, Shelley J']","['Shoemark DK', 'Allen SJ']","['School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol, Southmead Hospital, Bristol, UK.', 'School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol, Southmead Hospital, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"[""106/ALZS_/Alzheimer's Society/United Kingdom""]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aging/*immunology', 'Alzheimer Disease/immunology/*microbiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immune System/pathology', '*Immunity, Innate', '*Microbiota', 'Mouth/*microbiology']",,,2014/08/16 06:00,2015/08/22 06:00,['2014/08/16 06:00'],"['2014/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['0203701U68005336 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-141170 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2015;43(3):725-38. doi: 10.3233/JAD-141170.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'blood-brain barrier', 'environmental', 'epidemiological', 'immune-tolerated', 'innate', 'microbiome', 'oral', 'polymorphism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A clue into the importance that the interdependence between AD and vascularity has gained in scientific opinion is the large amount of recent reviews, almost reaching that of original papers, on the topic.

As a result, there has been considerable interest in identifying methods that maintain or enhance cognitive functioning in these older adults. Existing pharmacological agents are limited in this respect and disease-modifying agents are years away from being available. Cognitively based interventions (i.e., cognitive training, cognitive rehabilitation) hold particular promise for maximizing patients' functioning, are relatively inexpensive, and have virtually no side effects. Everyday life is complex and multifaceted, which means that a personalized approach is essential for maximizing and prolonging functioning in each patient. Unfortunately, little is known about the factors contributing to such an approach. The current review first identifies several lifestyle factors that have been shown to be neuroprotective as well as risk factors that may ultimately contribute to the efficacy of different cognitive intervention techniques. There is a critical need to understand the conditions under which individual techniques are effective; an issue examined through characteristic examples across the AD spectrum.

Identification of etiological factors for AD and active implementation of interventions targeting those modifiable factors that may prevent or postpone clinical onset of the dementing disorder will provide an opportunity to cope with this challenge. Multidisciplinary research involving epidemiology, neuropathology, and neuroimaging has provided moderately strong evidence supporting the role of vascular factors and related disorders (e.g., midlife high blood pressure and obesity, diabetes, cerebral microvascular lesions, and smoking) as risk factors and the possible role of psychosocial factors (e.g., high educational achievements, mentally-stimulating activity, social engagement, and physical exercise) as protective factors in the development and clinical manifestation of the dementia syndrome, including AD. The implementation of long-term, multidomain interventions designed for the modification of multiple vascular risk factors and the maintenance of socially-integrated lifestyles and mentally-stimulating activities is expected to postpone the clinical onset of AD and dementia, and thus, substantially reduce the burden of the disease at both the individual and societal levels.",,"['Qiu, Chengxuan', 'Xu, Weili', 'Fratiglioni, Laura']","['Qiu C', 'Xu W', 'Fratiglioni L']","['Aging Research Center, Karolinska Institutet-Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden. chengxuan.qiu@ki.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['*Alzheimer Disease/epidemiology/psychology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Psychology', 'Risk Factors', 'Vascular Diseases/*complications/*epidemiology']",,,2010/02/26 06:00,2010/09/09 06:00,['2010/02/26 06:00'],"['2010/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['682028731U442P52 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-2010-091663 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2010;20(3):689-97. doi: 10.3233/JAD-2010-091663.,,,,,,,,,,,,76,,,,,,,,,,

It is most likely that a reduction in CBF could displace a pathway leading to AD genesis, in so far neuron death explains a sustained reduction in the supply of oxygen, glucose, and nutrients. Nevertheless, the concept of secondary CBF deficiency cannot explain the critical stages of early memory loss while, on the other hand, the picture of progressive ischemia due to primary CBF decline sheds light on the course of AD in a most persuasive manner. The concept of primary CBF deficiency is even more strengthened by the lack of correlation between degree of dementia and amount of CBF. Vascular abnormalities, frequently observed to co-occur with AD, might play a critical role in the initiation and aggravation of AD pathology given that the elimination of amyloid-beta (Abeta) through a vascular route is an important brain Abeta clearance mechanism and its failure leads to formation of vascular amyloidosis and dense-core plaques.

Examples of dependence in AD range from a need for reminders (early AD) to requiring safety supervision and assistance with basic functions (late AD). Published literature has focused on the clinical domains as somewhat separate constructs and has given limited attention to the concept of patient dependence as a descriptor of AD progression.

RESULTS: We are currently in various phases of recruitment with over 55 data repositories in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and can presently query >250,000 subjects using GAAIN's search interfaces. DISCUSSION: GAAIN's data sharing philosophy, which guided our architectural choices, is conducive to motivating membership in a voluntary data sharing network.","[""Copyright (c) 2016 The Alzheimer's Association.

We integrate biomarker findings into a comprehensive model of AD pathogenesis from healthy aging to cognitive decline, the resilience to cerebral amyloid load (RECAL) matrix. The RECAL framework integrates factors of risk and resilience to cerebral amyloid load for individual risk prediction. We show the clinical consequences when the RECAL matrix is operationalized into a diagnostic algorithm both for individual counseling of subjects and for the identification of at risk samples for primary and secondary preventive trials. We discuss the implication of biomarkers for the identification of prodromal AD for the primary care system that seems presently not even prepared to cope with the increasing number of subjects afflicted with late stage AD dementia, let alone future cohorts of subjects searching counseling or treatment of predementia and asymptomatic stages of AD. The paradigm shift in AD diagnosis and its operationalization into a diagnostic framework will have major implications for our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Now, for the first time, we have access to in vivo markers of key events in AD pathogenesis integrated into a heuristic framework that makes strong predictions on pattern of multimodal biomarkers in different stages of AD.

Cumulative data suggests that neuroinflammation plays a prominent and early role in AD, and there is compelling data from different research groups of age-associated dysregulation of the neuroimmune system. From the clinical point of view, despite clinical resemblance and neuropathological findings, there are important differences between the group of patients with sporadic early-onset (<65 years old) and late-onset AD (>65 years old). Thus, it seems important to understand the age-dependent relationship between neuroinflammation and the underlying biology of AD in order to identify potential explanations for clinical heterogeneity, interpret biomarkers, and promote the best treatment to different clinical AD phenotypes. The study of the delicate balance between pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory sides of immune players in the different ages of onset of AD would be important to understand treatment efficacy in clinical trials and eventually, not only direct treatment to early disease stages, but also the possibility of establishing different treatment approaches depending on the age of the patient.

Despite decades of thorough research in the field of AD, the pathomechanism is still not fully understood. The development of novel experimental models can help us in the discovery of both genetic and non-genetic components of disease pathogenesis. As currently available therapies in AD can provide merely moderate or only temporary symptomatic relief, there is a great demand for the development of new drugs with higher therapeutic potential.

In particular, there is growing evidence that hypertensive people that do not have their BP adequately treated and controlled in midlife are more likely to develop AD in late-life. It has been hypothesized that cerebrovascular disease is a common pathway which connects hypertension and AD in individuals with apolipoprotein E genotype through brain hypoperfusion and hypoxia. This could accelerate amyloid-beta aggregation that disrupts cell-to-cell connectivity and leads to eventual brain neuron loss. Also, high BP contributes to worsen AD by raising oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Aging-related structural and functional disturbances appear to exacerbate the deleterious effect of chronic hypertension on cerebral blood flow autoregulation. There is evidence suggesting that some antihypertensive drug classes reduce the risk and progression of AD more than others. Further prospective randomized studies comparing different classes of antihypertensive drugs are needed to provide more evidence regarding their effects on AD risk. Hypotension could be a consequence of the incident dementia and conversely deteriorate the outcome of AD by worsening brain hypoperfusion.

Similarly, three postulates are formulated here to help evaluate hypothetical proposals attempting to explain the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The first postulate requires that the cause of AD precedes the cognitive decline and neurodegenerative pathology that characterize AD. This rule identifies a primary event from a neuropathological effect generated by the disease process. The second postulate stipulates that interventions aimed at the proposed causal event should prevent or reverse the cognitive and neurodegenerative pathology associated with AD prior to disease onset. This postulate emphasizes prevention or reversal of emerging neurocognitive pathology considerably before AD onset. If the first and second postulate requirements are met, the third postulate follows that interventions targeting the causal event should significantly lower the incidence of AD. For a causal hypothesis to be considered ""likely"" pathogenic to AD, support from all three postulates is a requisite. The pragmatic potential of the three postulates was applied to seven proposals using evidence-based meta-analysis mainly from randomized controlled trials. Proposals included the amyloid-beta, cell cycle, cholinergic, inflammatory, oxidative stress, tau, and vascular hypotheses. Clinical evidence derived from each proposal formed the basis for an inferential conclusion based on the level of confidence provided by the trial data. The three postulates may challenge or help validate a proposed cause-effect relationship to AD and serve as a useful model for designing more intelligent therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing AD.",,"['de la Torre, Jack C']",['de la Torre JC'],"[""Center for Alzheimer's Research, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aging/*metabolism/psychology', 'Alzheimer Disease/*etiology/*metabolism/psychology', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Oxidative Stress/*physiology', 'Plaque, Amyloid/*metabolism']",,,2011/02/16 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2011/02/16 06:00'],"['2011/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['5G1H566630J5851R [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-2011-101884 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2011;24(4):657-68. doi: 10.3233/JAD-2011-101884.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rare familial early-onset form of the disease is caused by dominant mutations in at least four different genes. Three of these genes have now been identified and the gene for presenilin 1 (PS1) on chromosome 14 is mutated in about 75% of the families. By contrast, the common form of Alzheimer's disease has late onset and may occur as sporadic cases in the families. This form is multifactorial and the most important genetic risk factor is the E4 allele of the polymorphic apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) on chromosome 19. The E4 allele is associated with moderately or strongly increased lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease in persons with respectively one or two copies of the gene variant.

Faced with limited treatment options, patients and their relatives may come to consider complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) a viable option, albeit one with minimal supporting evidence. Accordingly, the hopes and needs of some preclinical patients and their relatives could further fuel market-oriented entrepreneurship for CAM.

Sporadic AD is a complex multifactorial neurodegenerative disease with evidence indicating coexisting multi-pathogen and inflammatory etiologies. There are significant associations between AD and various pathogens, including Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), Cytomegalovirus, and other Herpesviridae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, spirochetes, Helicobacter pylori, and various periodontal pathogens. These pathogens are able to evade destruction by the host immune system, leading to persistent infection. Bacterial and viral DNA and RNA and bacterial ligands increase the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules and activate the innate and adaptive immune systems. Evidence demonstrates that pathogens directly and indirectly induce AD pathology, including amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation, phosphorylation of tau protein, neuronal injury, and apoptosis. Chronic brain infection with HSV-1, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and spirochetes results in complex processes that interact to cause a vicious cycle of uncontrolled neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Infections such as Cytomegalovirus, Helicobacter pylori, and periodontal pathogens induce production of systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines that may cross the blood-brain barrier to promote neurodegeneration. Pathogen-induced inflammation and central nervous system accumulation of Abeta damages the blood-brain barrier, which contributes to the pathophysiology of AD. Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) enhances brain infiltration by pathogens including HSV-1 and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. ApoE4 is also associated with an increased pro-inflammatory response by the immune system.

METHODS: We used AD patient data (N = 7815) from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center database and multinomial logistic regression to investigate presentation age and first cognitive/behavioral symptoms. RESULTS: The odds of having a nonmemory first cognitive symptom (including impairment in judgment and problem solving, language, and visuospatial function) increased with younger age (P < .001, all tests). Compared with apathy/withdrawal, the odds of having depression and ""other"" behavioral symptoms increased with younger age (P < .02, both tests), whereas the odds of having psychosis and no behavioral symptom increased with older age (P < .001, both tests). DISCUSSION: There is considerable heterogeneity in the first cognitive/behavioral symptoms experienced by AD patients. Proportions of these symptoms change with age with patients experiencing increasing nonmemory cognitive symptoms and more behavioral symptoms at younger ages.","[""Copyright (c) 2015 The Alzheimer's Association.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of motor symptoms with cognition or neurodegeneration in patients with AD, and whether this association differs by the age at onset. METHODS: We included 113 amyloid positive AD patients and divided them into early-onset AD (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD), who underwent the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-Part III (=UPDRS) scoring, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)/Clinical Deterioration Rating Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SOB), and magnetic resonance image (MRI). Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the association of UPDRS and MMSE/CDR-SOB or MRI neurodegeneration measures, and whether the association differs according to the group. RESULTS: The prevalence of motor symptoms and their severity did not differ between the groups. Lower MMSE (beta= -1.1, p < 0.001) and higher CDR-SOB (beta= 2.0, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with higher UPDRS. There was no interaction effect between MMSE/CDR-SOB and AD group on UPDRS. Global or all regional cortical thickness and putaminal volume were negatively associated with UPDRS score, but the interaction effect of neurodegeneration and AD group on UPDRS score was significant only in parietal lobe (p for interaction = 0.035), which showed EOAD to have a more pronounced association between parietal thinning and motor symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that the severity of motor deterioration in AD is related to the severity of cognitive impairment itself rather than age at onset, and motor symptoms might occur through multiple mechanisms including cortical and subcortical atrophy.",,"['Kim, Jinhee', 'Jang, Hyemin', 'Park, Yu-Hyun', 'Youn, Jinyoung', 'Seo, Sang Won', 'Kim, Hee Jin', 'Na, Duk L']","['Kim J', 'Jang H', 'Park YH', 'Youn J', 'Seo SW', 'Kim HJ', 'Na DL']","['Departments of Neurology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Departments of Neurology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Samsung Alzheimers Convergence Research Center, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Neuroscience Center, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Departments of Neurology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Samsung Alzheimers Convergence Research Center, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Departments of Neurology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Neuroscience Center, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Departments of Neurology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Samsung Alzheimers Convergence Research Center, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Neuroscience Center, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, SAIHST, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Research Design & Evaluation, SAIHST, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Departments of Neurology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Samsung Alzheimers Convergence Research Center, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Neuroscience Center, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Neurology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Humans', '*Alzheimer Disease/complications/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', '*Cognitive Dysfunction/complications', 'Mental Status and Dementia Tests', 'Cognition']",,,2022/11/22 06:00,2023/01/11 06:00,['2022/11/21 01:21'],"['2022/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/01/11 06:00 [medline]', '2022/11/21 01:21 [entrez]']","['JAD220745 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-220745 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2023;91(1):345-354. doi: 10.3233/JAD-220745.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'neuropsychological tests', 'parkinsonian disorders']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite improved management, a cure has not been found and hence analysis of predisposing factors to identify preventive strategies has become increasingly important. Surgery and anesthesia have been proposed to increase the incidence of post-operative cognitive decline (POCD) and AD. This is hypothesized to be the result of a malignant neuroinflammatory response and subsequent synaptic impairment in the elderly and susceptible individuals. As a result, strategies are being explored to prevent surgery and anesthesia induced cognitive impairment. Whereas previously the diagnosis of AD was primarily dependent on clinical examination, biomarkers such as inflammatory cytokines, amyloid-beta, and tau deposition in the cerebrospinal fluid have received increased attention. Nonetheless, AD is currently still treated symptomatically with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA antagonists to improve cholinergic transmission and prevent glutamatergic excitotoxicity. Therapeutic success is, however, often not achieved, since these treatment methods do not address the ongoing neuroinflammatory processes and hence novel therapeutic and protective strategies are urgently needed. This review provides an insight into the current understanding of age-related cognitive impairment post-surgery and reflects on novel markers of AD pathogeneses exploring their use as targets for treatment. It gives a summary of recent efforts in preventing and treating POCD or AD with regards to the choice and depth of anesthesia, surgical strategy, and peri-operative medication, and discusses the mechanism of action and therapeutic prospects of novel agents.",,"['Kapila, Ayush K', 'Watts, Helena R', 'Wang, Tianlong', 'Ma, Daqing']","['Kapila AK', 'Watts HR', 'Wang T', 'Ma D']","['Anaesthetics, Pain Medicine and Intensive Care, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Chelsea & Westminster Hospital, London, UK.', 'Anaesthetics, Pain Medicine and Intensive Care, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Chelsea & Westminster Hospital, London, UK.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Anaesthetics, Pain Medicine and Intensive Care, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Chelsea & Westminster Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"[""186/ALZS_/Alzheimer's Society/United Kingdom""]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/*etiology/physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Anesthesia/*adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology/physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Neuroprotective Agents/therapeutic use', '*Postoperative Complications']",,,2014/03/01 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2014/03/01 06:00'],"['2014/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['B8555956614Q8423 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-132258 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2014;41(1):1-13. doi: 10.3233/JAD-132258.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'anesthesia', 'cognitive decline', 'neuroinflammation', 'surgery']",,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, in the brains of some normal aged individuals, there are as many amyloid-beta plaques seen as in typical cases of AD.

More than one molecular mechanism has been described for the development of amyloid-beta as well as neurofibrillary degeneration of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau. Thus, AD apparently results from several different etiopathogenic mechanisms and offers numerous rational therapeutic targets. We have discovered that there are at least five different subgroups of AD, and future studies are likely to identify additional subgroups. The employment of these subgroups of AD in clinical trials can markedly increase the success in developing specific and potent therapeutic drugs.",,"['Iqbal, Khalid', 'Chohan, M Omar', 'Grundke-Iqbal, Inge']","['Iqbal K', 'Chohan MO', 'Grundke-Iqbal I']","['Department of Neurochemistry, New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, 1050 Forest Hill Road, Staten Island, New York, NY 10314, USA. iqbalk@worldnet att.net']",['eng'],"['AG028538/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG019158/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG019158-08/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AG019158/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG028538/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG019158-07/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG028538-02/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/classification/*drug therapy/etiology/genetics', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Patient Selection', 'Research Design']",PMC2676925,['NIHMS106729'],2008/10/28 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/28 09:00'],"['2008/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3233/jad-2008-15215 [doi]'],ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2008 Oct;15(2):339-45. doi: 10.3233/jad-2008-15215.,,,,,,['0 (Neuroprotective Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, the use of these diagnostic and scientific tools in clinical trial practice has not yet aligned or optimized. Most agents still target clinical end points associated with mild to moderate AD rather than focus on modulation of the underlying pathologies. Although there are obvious practical reasons for this, meaningful progress in other areas of medicine such as cardiology and oncology have generally targeted and monitored improvement or abatement of pathology as the primary end point as a successful disease-modifying strategy.

RESULTS: We found that mechanisms involving monoaminergic biosynthesis and function are likely key elements of NPS-AD and while current treatment approaches are in line with this, the lack of effectiveness may be due to contributions from additional mechanisms including neurodegenerative, vascular, inflammatory, and immunologic pathways.

This second revision of the postdiagnostic management of Alzheimer's disease (AD) guideline by the California Workgroup was prompted by significant advances in knowledge about appropriate care management, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches to treatment of the disease, accompanying behavioral problems, and functional decline. The focus remains explicitly on primary care, where the majority of it occurs for those with AD and other dementias. METHODS: In all, 40 experts in dementia care were recruited from a variety of disciplines across California. Four workgroups were created that reviewed recent research findings from a total of 569 publications since 2002. The revised Guideline incorporates 305 new references, including 11 state and federal laws, in addition to 78 references from the previous version. RESULTS: The Guideline is divided into four sections that address postdiagnostic management: (1) assessment, (2) treatment, (3) patient and family education and support, and (4) legal considerations associated with AD. Significant revisions and changes in each area and the underlying research to support the recommendations are presented in this article. New topics related to early stage and end-of-life were identified and recommendations were developed for these specific populations. CONCLUSIONS: The Guideline recommendations provide a framework to inform and improve medical care for AD by primary health care providers.","[""Copyright (c) 2011 The Alzheimer's Association.

We evaluate the performance of MRI-based neuromorphometrics features (nMF) in the classification of Healthy Controls (HC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), converters MCI (cMCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. NEW METHODS: We propose to segregate participants in three groups according to Mini Mental State Examination score (MMSEs), searching for the main nMF in each group. Then we use them to develop a Multi Classifier System (MCS). We compare the MCS against a single classifier scheme using both MMSEs+nMF and nMF only. We repeat this comparison using three state-of-the-art classification algorithms. RESULTS: The MCS showed the best performance on both Accuracy and Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC) in comparison with single classifiers. The multiclass AUC for the MCS classification on Test Dataset were 0.83 for HC, 0.76 for cMCI, 0.65 for MCI and 0.95 for AD. Furthermore, MCS's optimum accuracy on Neurodegenerative Disease (ND) detection (AD+cMCI vs MCI+HC) was 81.0% (AUC=0.88), while the single classifiers got 71.3% (AUC=0.86) and 63.1% (AUC=0.79) for MMSEs+nMF and only nMF respectively. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: The proposed MCS showed a better performance than using all nMF into a single state-of-the-art classifier. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that using cognitive scoring, e.g. MMSEs, in the design of a Multi Classifier System improves performance by allowing a better selection of MRI-based features.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence indicates that depression, anxiety, sleep disorder, neuroticism, life stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder increase risk for AD, and we suggest they do so by increasing Cognitive Debt. Repetitive negative thinking (RNT), a behaviorally measurable process common to these factors, may drive Cognitive Debt acquisition. RNT transcends disorder-specific definition, encompasses rumination and worry, and is defined by perseverative, negative thought tendencies. Evidence of dysregulated stress responses supports the concept of Cognitive Debt, of RNT as its causal mechanism, and of an interaction with the APOE-epsilon4 genotype to increase vulnerability to clinical AD, independent from traditional AD pathology. Defining a more specific behavioral profile of risk would enable interventions to be targeted earlier and more precisely at individuals most vulnerable to developing AD. Additionally, modulating RNT could potentially reduce risk of clinical AD. Interventions to reduce RNT are discussed, as are suggestions for future research.

A major source of difficulty in identifying safe and effective treatments for agitation is the lack of validated biomarkers. As such, patients may not be appropriately targeted, and biological response to pharmacotherapy cannot be adequately monitored. METHODS: This systematic review aimed to summarize evidence on the association between biomarkers and agitation/aggression in patients with Alzheimer's disease, utilizing the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association Research Framework and the Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools Resource of the Food and Drug Association-National Institutes of Health Biomarker Working Group. RESULTS: This review identified six classes of biomarkers (neuropathological, neurotransmitter, neuroimaging, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, inflammatory, and clusterin) associated with agitation/aggression, which were mostly diagnostic in nature. DISCUSSION: Future studies should investigate the predictive, prognostic, and monitoring capacity of biomarkers to provide insight into the longitudinal course of agitation/aggression, as well as predict and monitor biological response to a pharmacological intervention.","[""Copyright (c) 2018 the Alzheimer's Association.

An Alzheimer's Disease Dilemma.,289-96,10.3233/JAD-150124 [doi],"In the popular nursery rhyme, Humpty Dumpty's great fall and the inability to put him together again has been used to demonstrate the second law of thermodynamics. An oversimplification of this law states that all things in the universe tend to move from order to disorder, an occurrence that can be applied allegorically to the development and clinical outcome of Alzheimer's disease (AD). An important argument relevant to the future use of resources and primary focus of AD research arises from the question, do we make it a priority to mend the shattered brain of AD patients or attempt to prevent the brain from shattering? If the former approach continues to be the priority it has become, how exactly do we mend the irreparable neuronal loss and associated cognitive failure in advanced cases of AD? Or, must we change direction and make prevention the primary goal of AD research? The latter approach would identify asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with high risk of developing dementia by means of establishing multidisciplinary heart-brain clinics that would provide either close observation or a tailored therapeutic intervention. This is an important challenge that needs to be achieved if the AD incidence, societal costs and suffering, is to be significantly reduced.",,"['de la Torre Jack, C']",['de la Torre Jack C'],,['eng'],,['Editorial'],Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/metabolism', 'Brain/*physiopathology', 'Cognition', 'Entropy', 'Humans', 'Memory']",,,2015/03/18 06:00,2016/07/12 06:00,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['P3504277X81X4740 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-150124 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2015;46(2):289-96. doi: 10.3233/JAD-150124.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'amyloid-beta hypothesis', 'cognition', 'entropy', 'heart-brain clinics', 'memory', 'prevention']",,,,['0 (Amyloid beta-Peptides)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the limited causal treatment options they represent a big challenge. OBJECTIVE: Overview of disease-modifying strategies in neurodegenerative diseases and outlook regarding future treatment development. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Literature search regarding treatment development in neurodegenerative diseases and integration of the results. Additionally, consideration of expert opinions. RESULTS: The development of biomarkers and genetic parameters for the detection of causal pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases as an indispensable basis for the development of disease-modifying treatment is rapidly advancing. Targets for causal interventions are all steps in the pathophysiological cascade of neurodegenerative diseases. Therapeutic antibodies are most advanced in the development and are able to remove protein deposits from the brain and to reduce the clinical progression in Alzheimer's disease. A combination of biomarkers, genetic characteristics and clinical parameters could enable an individualized treatment. CONCLUSION: The future of the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases focuses on disease modification using molecular-based approaches. Targeted interventions against protein aggregation, inflammation and genetic factors as well as a personalized stratification of treatment hold promise for more effective forms of treatment. Although challenges still remain, current research and clinical studies give optimism for the development of disease-modifying treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.","['(c) 2023.

We update the prediction with an improved model and newer data. METHODS: The model tracks patients from initial evaluation, cognitive testing by a dementia specialist, confirmatory biomarker testing, and infusion delivery. All steps after initial evaluation are assumed to be capacity constrained. Model parameters and assumptions about care-seeking behavior were derived from the published literature and expert input. RESULTS: If patients were referred based on a brief cognitive test, wait times for specialist visits would reach around 50 months. If referral also required a positive blood-based biomarker test, wait times would be around 12 months. In both scenarios, wait times for confirmatory biomarker testing and infusion treatment would be limited. DISCUSSION: Better diagnostic tools at initial evaluation may reduce unnecessary delays in access to treatment.","[""(c) 2021 the Alzheimer's Association.""]","['Mattke, Soeren', 'Hanson, Mark']","['Mattke S', 'Hanson M']","['University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Alzheimers Dement,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978,IM,"['*Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/therapy', 'Biomarkers', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Humans', 'Referral and Consultation', 'United States', '*Waiting Lists']",,,2021/09/28 06:00,2022/05/11 06:00,['2021/09/27 09:04'],"['2021/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/27 09:04 [entrez]']",['10.1002/alz.12470 [doi]'],ppublish,Alzheimers Dement. 2022 May;18(5):1071-1074. doi: 10.1002/alz.12470.

Globally, trees drawn by patients showed an evolution characterized by a progressive reduction of the crown compared to the trunk. TC index showed a significant linear growth change (2.52 points per year) while SO index did not significantly increase. No significant associations were found examining the relations between MMSE and TC and SO index.

Key features of this guidance are the advocacy of sensitive cognitive measures and a taxonomy of disease severity. Whilst desirable patterns of cognitive-functional improvement are included, specific measures, and the magnitude of required effects, are not described. MAIN SECTION: We describe key elements of the guidance content, especially with regard targeting key cognitive domains and the means by which they might be efficiently indexed in the disease stages included in the guidance. We discuss also the opportunities to assess cognitive performance in 'Stage 2' and 'Stage 3' patients, as well as the possibilities for effectively assessing function in the latter category. In this section we review candidate cognitive assessments that we judge are capable of delivering on the guidance specification for sensitive neuropsychological measures. This includes detailed consideration of the ADCS-PACC and Catch-Cog initiatives. With respect to the magnitude of effects, we propose that standardised effect sizes of 0.3 represent a reasonable level of efficacy based on the observation that already marketed drugs on average deliver this level of improvement. CONCLUSIONS: We propose the use of cognitive measures in stage 2 patients to index the cognitive skills known to be compromised early in the Alzheimer's disease process. We recommend extending the traditional interest in episodic memory to include sensitive, reliable and valid measures of attention, working memory and aspects of executive function. We propose a focus on these additional cognitive abilities based on evidence that performance on tests of these domains is moderately well related to functional skills.",,"['Harrison, John E']",['Harrison JE'],"['Metis Cognition Ltd., Kilmington Common, Wiltshire, BA12 6QY, UK. johncpc@btinternet.com.', 'Alzheimer Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. johncpc@btinternet.com.', ""IoPPN, King's College London, London, UK. johncpc@btinternet.com.""]",['eng'],,['Editorial'],England,Alzheimers Res Ther,Alzheimer's research & therapy,101511643,,"['Alzheimer Disease/*complications/therapy', 'Cognition Disorders/*etiology/therapy', 'Guidelines as Topic/*standards', 'Humans', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration/*standards']",PMC6026341,,2018/07/01 06:00,2019/08/03 06:00,['2018/07/01 06:00'],"['2018/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13195-018-0386-7 [pii]', '386 [pii]', '10.1186/s13195-018-0386-7 [doi]']",epublish,Alzheimers Res Ther. 2018 Jun 29;10(1):61. doi: 10.1186/s13195-018-0386-7.,['NOTNLM'],"['Alzheimers', 'Attention', 'Cognition', 'Dementia', 'Executive', 'Memory', 'Neuropsychological']","['ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Not applicable.

The cognitive rehabilitation interventions focused on memory are usual in Alzheimer's disease. Memory deficits are prominent from the early stages of the disease and cause detriment to patient autonomy in daily life. In particular, problems of identity and autobiographical memory, although still often overlooked in the patients' general neuropsychological profile, appear right away. Because of their more insidious negative influence, specific treatments are still underdeveloped. Rehabilitation of autobiographical memory is complex because it requires taking into account its multiple components, both semantic and episodic, but also understanding its links with personal identity. Thus, this article provides an overview of existing cognitive rehabilitation interventions of anterograde and retrograde autobiographical memory in Alzheimer's disease. We specify the contribution of new technologies to improve the consolidation of recent events memory and of a rehabilitation program of autobiographical memory - REMau -, derived from the TEMPau task, which takes into account the constructive nature of episodic memories via the personal semantic through different periods of life. The main aim is to examine what are the objectives, benefits and limitations of these interventions and to estimate how they can meet the more general problem of deficiency in personal identity. As identity is constructed on the basis of past experience, but is modulated by new experiences, our current challenge is to associate combined treatments of anterograde and retrograde memory based on the interaction between autobiographical memory and the self.",,"['Lalanne, Jennifer', 'Piolino, Pascale']","['Lalanne J', 'Piolino P']","['Laboratoire memoire et cognition, Institut de psychologie, Universite Paris Descartes, Boulogne Billancourt, France, Inserm UMR S894, Centre de psychiatrie et neurosciences, Paris, France.']",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil,Geriatrie et psychologie neuropsychiatrie du vieillissement,101553404,IM,"['Aged', 'Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Amnesia, Retrograde/diagnosis/psychology/rehabilitation', 'Attention', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', '*Memory, Episodic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Nootropic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Self Concept', 'Semantics']",,,2013/09/13 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/09/13 06:00'],"['2013/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['pnv.2013.0422 [pii]', '10.1684/pnv.2013.0422 [doi]']",ppublish,Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil. 2013 Sep;11(3):275-85. doi: 10.1684/pnv.2013.0422.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimers'disease"", 'SenseCam', 'TEMPau', 'autobiographical memory', 'rehabilitation', 'self']",,Prise en charge des troubles de la memoire autobiographique dans la maladie d'Alzheimer du stade debutant au stade severe : revue de la litterature et nouvelles perspectives.,,['0 (Nootropic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attempts to find cures for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have, however, failed so far, in spite of enormous investments, intellectual and financial. We therefore have to reconsider the problem from new angles. AD is regarded as a disease because of its clinical manifestations and underlying pathology. However, this combination does not define a disease but rather a syndrome, just like hepatic cirrhosis in which liver pathology causes metabolic changes, but which can result from many different etiologies. It is unlikely that attacking a downstream phenomenon, like apoptosis or amyloid-beta accumulation, can cure AD, or prevent the progression of the disease. It is probable that senile dementia is the result of a combination of several processes, working differently in each person. Epidemiological studies have identified many risk factors for ""senile dementia of the Alzheimer type"", some genetic but most environmental and therefore modifiable. Thus, a concerted action to fight the dementia epidemic must be made by aggressive action against its risk factors, and this battle must begin in midlife, not in old age.",,"['Korczyn, Amos D']",['Korczyn AD'],"['Departments of Neurology, Physiology and Pharmacology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel. amoskor@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/pathology/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', '*Treatment Failure', 'tau Proteins/metabolism']",,,2012/01/20 06:00,2012/07/27 06:00,['2012/01/20 06:00'],"['2012/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['KR71J7741GR56558 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-2011-110359 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2012;29(2):275-82. doi: 10.3233/JAD-2011-110359.,,,,,,['0 (tau Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Episodic autobiographical memories, especially the richness of details, were impaired early in the course of Alzheimer's disease or even in the preclinical phase, while semantic memories were spared until moderate stages, indicating a dissociation between both memory systems.

Despite the high prevalence of these behaviors, little is known about the factors which lead some patients to develop florid behavioral symptoms while others may progress to severe dementia without such phenomenon. We examined whether regional brain volumes as measured by cortical thickness would predict the presence or absence of disinhibition in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Using data from the ADNI, we identified 758 patients with caregiver ratings on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and a volumetric MRI scan with cortical thickness measurements completed in FreeSurfer by the UCSF core. Of these, 177 patients were found to have disinhibition. Logistic regression models demonstrated that reduced cortical thickness in the right frontal pole was associated with the presence of disinhibition even when controlling for age, disease severity, total intracranial volume, gender, and APOE genotype.

There is substantial evidence for reproductive history affecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology. Here, we demonstrate how breastfeeding history affects women's risk of AD. Reproductive history data was collected, and AD diagnostic interviews were performed, for a cohort of elderly British women. Using Cox proportional-hazard models, we find that longer breastfeeding duration corresponded to reduced risk of AD (p < 0.01, n = 81). Women who breastfed had lower AD risk than women who did not breastfeed (p = 0.017, n = 81). Breastfeeding practices are an important modifier of cumulative endogenous hormone exposure for mothers. Ovarian hormone deprivation and/or insulin sensitivity benefits of breastfeeding may be responsible for the observed reduction in AD risk.

We invited people with mild AD and control participants to conduct The Thinking about Life Experiences (TALE) Scale. More specifically, we invited participants to indicate whether they think about their life story: when they want to feel that they are the same person that they were before (Item 1), when they are concerned about whether they are still the same type of person that they were earlier (Item 2), when they are concerned about whether their values have changed over time (Item 3), when they are concerned about whether their beliefs have changed over time (Item 4), and when they want to understand how they have changed from who they were before (Item 5). The scores of people with AD and control participants on the items of the TALE scale were similar, except for the first item on which people with AD provided higher scores than did control participants. As demonstrated by scores on Item 1, people with mild AD can retrieve autobiographical memories to reflect on situations in which they want to feel that they are the same person that they were before. In other words, people with mild AD can draw on their personal and meaningful events to maintain a continuous sense of self or even to reflect on situations in which they are concerned about their self-continuity.",,"['El Haj, Mohamad', 'Boudoukha, Abdelhalim', 'Antoine, Pascal', 'Moustafa, Ahmed A', 'Gallouj, Karim', 'Allain, Philippe']","['El Haj M', 'Boudoukha A', 'Antoine P', 'Moustafa AA', 'Gallouj K', 'Allain P']","['Laboratoire de Psychologie des Pays de la Loire (EA 4638), Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Unite de Geriatrie, Centre Hospitalier de Tourcoing, Tourcoing, France.', 'Institut Universitaire de France, Paris, France.', 'Laboratoire de Psychologie des Pays de la Loire (EA 4638), Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Universite de Lille, CNRS, CHU Lille, UMR 9193 - SCALab - Sciences Cognitives et Sciences Affectives, Lille, France.', 'School of Social Sciences and Psychology & Marcs Institute for Brain and Behaviour, Western Sydney University, Sydney, Australia.', 'Unite de Geriatrie, Centre Hospitalier de Tourcoing, Tourcoing, France.', 'Laboratoire de Psychologie des Pays de la Loire (EA 4638), Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/*psychology/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Memory, Episodic', 'Mental Recall/*physiology', '*Self-Assessment']",,,2019/07/20 06:00,2020/10/10 06:00,['2019/07/20 06:00'],"['2019/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD190440 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-190440 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2019;70(4):1217-1224. doi: 10.3233/JAD-190440.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'autobiographical memory', 'self', 'self-continuity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis of published studies was performed to determine whether AD patients have a distinctive personality trait profile compared to healthy subjects (HC), similar to or different from a premorbid personality profile consistently reported in previous studies. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using PsycInfo (PROQUEST), PubMed, and Scopus. The meta-analysis pooled results from primary studies using Hedges' g unbiased approach. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 10 primary studies and revealed that, when the personality was evaluated by informant-rated measures, AD patients had significantly higher levels of Neuroticism, lower levels of Openness, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Extraversion than HCs. When the personality was evaluated by self-rated measures, the results obtained from informants were confirmed for Neuroticism, Openness, and Extraversion but not for Agreeableness and Conscientiousness where AD patients and HCs achieved similar scores. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis revealed that high Neuroticism and low Openness and Extraversion are distinctive personality traits significantly associated with a diagnosis of AD when evaluated both self-rated and informant-rated measures. This personality trait profile is similar to premorbid one, which contributes to development of AD over time.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the number of people living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and mild AD dementia in France in 2022 that could be eligible to future AD therapies. METHODS: A step-by-step approach was defined based on disease stages definition and clinical practice. In line with AD guidelines, amyloid-positive profile is considered in our estimates to enhance the diagnosis accuracy of early stages of AD. Age-stratified prevalence from French cohort and international pooled analyses were identified to feed the different steps. To consider uncertainty around mean prevalence values, low and high scenarii based on the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval were conducted. RESULTS: We estimated that 2.5 (low scenario: 1.7 - high scenario: 3.6) million people suffer from mild cognitive impairment in France in 2022 among whom 1.65 (low: 1.5 - high: 1.8) million people meet the criteria for mild cognitive impairment due to AD i.e., with amyloid positive profile. The expected number of clinical AD dementia is estimated at 925,886 people. Among those, 379,278 people suffer from mild AD dementia based on clinical diagnosis, including 311,043 (low: 289,174 - high: 328,332) cases with amyloid positive profile.

Having previously observed a significant relationship between stages of functional dependence (the level of assistance patients require consequent to Alzheimer's disease deficits, derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Scale) and cognitive severity, we investigated whether measures of functional dependence could be utilized to identify clinical milestones of Alzheimer's disease progression. OBJECTIVES: To describe the patterns of change in dependence over the course of 18 months in groups stratified according to cognitive Alzheimer's disease dementia severity (determined using the Mini-Mental State Examination score) and to identify characteristics associated with patients showing worsening dependence (progressors) versus those showing no change or improvement (non-progressors). DESIGN: Analysis of longitudinal data from the GERAS study. SETTING: GERAS is an 18-month prospective, multicenter, naturalistic, observational cohort study reflecting the routine care of patients with Alzheimer's disease in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 1495 community-living patients, aged >/=55 years, diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease dementia, and their caregivers. MEASUREMENTS: Dependence levels, cognitive function, behavioral symptoms, caregiver burden, and cost were assessed at baseline and at 18 months. RESULTS: Of 971 patients having both baseline and 18-month data, 42% (408) were progressors and 563 (58%) were non-progressors. This general pattern held for all three levels of baseline Alzheimer's disease dementia severity - mild (Mini-Mental State Examination score 21-26), moderate (15-20) or moderately severe/severe (<15) - with 40-45% of each group identified as progressors and 55-60% as non-progressors. No baseline differences were seen between progressors and non-progressors in cognitive scores or behavioral symptoms, although progressors had significantly shorter times since diagnosis and showed milder functional impairment. Baseline factors predictive of increasing dependence over 18 months included more severe cognitive impairment, living with others, and having multiple caregivers. A higher level of initial dependence was associated with less risk of dependence progression. Total societal costs of care also increased with greater dependence. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort, 42% of Alzheimer's disease dementia patients at all levels of cognitive severity became more dependent within 18 months of observation while 58% did not progress. Dependence levels may be considered as meaningful interim clinical milestones that reflect Alzheimer's disease-related functional deficits, although a time frame that extends beyond 18 months may be necessary to observe changes if used in clinical trials or other longitudinal studies. Recognition of predictors of greater dependence offers opportunities for intervention.",,"['Kahle-Wrobleski, K', 'Andrews, J S', 'Belger, M', 'Ye, W', 'Gauthier, S', 'Rentz, D M', 'Galasko, D']","['Kahle-Wrobleski K', 'Andrews JS', 'Belger M', 'Ye W', 'Gauthier S', 'Rentz DM', 'Galasko D']","['Kristin Kahle-Wrobleski, PhD, Global Patient Outcomes and Real World Evidence, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis IN 46285, USA, Phone: 317-651-9881, Fax: 317-276-5791, Email: wrobleski_kristin_kahle@lilly.com.']",['eng'],['P50 AG005131/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",Switzerland,J Prev Alzheimers Dis,The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,101638820,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', 'Alzheimer Disease/*diagnosis/economics/psychology/therapy', 'Caregivers', 'Cognition', 'Cost of Illness', '*Disease Progression', 'Female', 'France', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mental Status and Dementia Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'United Kingdom']",PMC5912689,['NIHMS958813'],2017/12/01 06:00,2018/09/25 06:00,['2017/11/30 06:00'],"['2017/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.14283/jpad.2017.2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Prev Alzheimers Dis. 2017;4(2):72-80. doi: 10.14283/jpad.2017.2.,['NOTNLM'],"['ADCS-ADL', 'Alzheimer disease', 'GERAS', 'dependence', 'observational study']","['KK-W, JSA, MB and WY are all employees and minor shareholders of Eli Lilly and', 'Company.

The statement, which reflects the collective views and recommendations of leaders in AD research, is intended to aid the implementation of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA)'s National Plan to defeat AD. The primary public policy aims of this 10-year scientific agenda are to discover, validate, and develop: (1) a broad range of technologies, tools and algorithms for early detection of people with symptomatic AD, and asymptomatic individuals at elevated risk for AD and other dementias; and (2) a wide range of interventions to preserve and/or restore health and normal neural function, aiming to maintain independent functioning for as long as possible. The long-term scientific public health objectives of this comprehensive plan are to: (1) reduce the number of people with chronic disabling symptoms who will require prolonged care and, eventually, reduce the number of asymptomatic people at elevated risk for AD/dementia; (2) delay the onset of chronic disability for people with AD and other degenerative brain disorders; and (3) lower the cost and burden of care. The plan calls for significant expansion of research programs to identify and validate the cause(s) and pathogenesis of AD, genetic and epigenetic factors that contribute to AD risk, therapeutic targets that affect disease progression, surrogate biomarkers of AD pathobiology, and technologies for early detection of AD.","[""Copyright (c) 2012 The Alzheimer's Association.

METHODS: We used a multistate model incorporating biomarkers for preclinical AD with US population projections. RESULTS: Approximately 6.08 million Americans had either clinical AD or mild cognitive impairment due to AD in 2017 and that will grow to 15.0 million by 2060. In 2017, 46.7 million Americans had preclinical AD (amyloidosis, neurodegeneration, or both), although many may not progress to clinical disease during their lifetimes. Primary and secondary preventions have differential impact on future disease burden. DISCUSSION: Because large numbers of persons are living with preclinical AD, our results underscore the need for secondary preventions for persons with existing AD brain pathology who are likely to develop clinical disease during their lifetimes as well as primary preventions for persons without preclinical disease.","[""Copyright (c) 2017 the Alzheimer's Association.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the relative contribution of neuropsychiatric symptoms in predicting ratings of functional status. METHODS: A total of 223 patients received routine neurological and neuropsychological evaluations and met criteria of probable AD dementia based on the McKhann criteria. Demographic, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric variables were entered in a hierarchical linear regression analysis to predict functional status as measured by the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). RESULTS: The total model explained 29.7% of the variance (p <  0.001) in FAQ. Importantly, neuropsychiatric variables explained 12.7% of the unique variance, with apathy and sleep as significant contributors. CONCLUSION: Two neuropsychiatric variables, apathy and changes in sleep/nighttime behaviors, predicted ratings of functional status in AD patients independent of age, global cognition, memory and executive function measures, and depressive symptoms. These results highlight the importance of neuropsychiatric symptoms in understanding and potentially treating the functional limitations so prevalent in AD.",,"['You, S Christine', 'Walsh, Christine M', 'Chiodo, Louis A', 'Ketelle, Robin', 'Miller, Bruce L', 'Kramer, Joel H']","['You SC', 'Walsh CM', 'Chiodo LA', 'Ketelle R', 'Miller BL', 'Kramer JH']","['Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, Memory and Aging Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, Memory and Aging Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, Memory and Aging Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, Memory and Aging Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01AG022983/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 AG023501/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AG032289/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AG019724/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG032289/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG022983/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aged', 'Alzheimer Disease/*diagnosis/physiopathology/*psychology', 'Apathy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Neurologic Examination', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Wake Disorders/physiopathology']",PMC4751056,['NIHMS755435'],2015/09/25 06:00,2016/07/15 06:00,['2015/09/25 06:00'],"['2015/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['JAD150018 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-150018 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2015;48(3):863-9. doi: 10.3233/JAD-150018.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'apathy', 'neuropsychology', 'sleep disorders']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Picture description tasks can be used to approximate everyday communication abilities of AD patients.

This systematic review aims to provide researchers with an overview of the most common areas of impairment in AD discourse as they appear in picture description tasks. Based on the 44 articles fulfilling inclusion criteria, our findings reflect a multidimensional pattern of changes in the production (speech rate), syntactic (length of utterance), lexical (word-frequency and use of pronouns), fluency (repetitions and word-finding difficulties), semantic (information units), and discourse (efficiency) domains. We discuss our findings in the light of current research and point to potential scientific and clinical uses of picture description tasks in the context of AD.",,"['Slegers, Antoine', 'Filiou, Renee-Pier', 'Montembeault, Maxime', 'Brambati, Simona Maria']","['Slegers A', 'Filiou RP', 'Montembeault M', 'Brambati SM']","['Departement de Psychologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Centre de Recherche de l'Institut Universitaire de Geriatrie de Montreal (CRIUGM), CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l'Ile-de-Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Departement de Psychologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Centre de Recherche de l'Institut Universitaire de Geriatrie de Montreal (CRIUGM), CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l'Ile-de-Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Departement de Psychologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Centre de Recherche de l'Institut Universitaire de Geriatrie de Montreal (CRIUGM), CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l'Ile-de-Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Departement de Psychologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Centre de Recherche de l'Institut Universitaire de Geriatrie de Montreal (CRIUGM), CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l'Ile-de-Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.""]",['eng'],['CIHR/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,,"['Alzheimer Disease/*diagnosis/psychology', 'Humans', 'Language Disorders/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', '*Speech']",,,2018/08/15 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2018/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD170881 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-170881 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2018;65(2):519-542. doi: 10.3233/JAD-170881.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'language tests', 'psycholinguistics', 'systematic review']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is carried out by solving the modified Puri-Li model under steady-state conditions. The derived expressions show that the inclusion of calcium ions has altered the steady-state populations of Abeta, microglia, and astroglia. The calcium ions activate the synthesis of Abeta which in turn increases the calcium ions entering the cytoplasm of the neuronal cells, thus creating a positive loop. The study also shows that as AD progresses, the inclusion of calcium ions enhances the production of microglia and astroglia. Examination of the steady-state solutions of microglia and astroglia shows that equilibrium conditions are achieved by microglia and astroglia destroying neurons. These model results are in agreement with experimental findings, which show a feed back loop between calcium ion levels and Abeta; population increase in microglia, astroglia during AD; and microglia, astroglia acting as inflammatory cells producing toxins to destroy neurons during AD. Increased production of Abeta, microglia, and astroglia resulting from increased levels of calcium ions suggests that controlling the calcium ion levels could present a therapeutic strategy to combat AD.",,"['Thuraisingham, R A']",['Thuraisingham RA'],"[', 1A, Russell St, Eastwood, NSW 2122, Australia. ranjit@optusnet.com.au.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Mol Neurosci,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/etiology/*metabolism', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/metabolism', 'Astrocytes/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', '*Homeostasis', 'Humans', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Neurons/metabolism']",,,2018/05/14 06:00,2019/02/20 06:00,['2018/05/14 06:00'],"['2018/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12031-018-1080-8 [pii]', '10.1007/s12031-018-1080-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Neurosci. 2018 Jun;65(2):119-126. doi: 10.1007/s12031-018-1080-8.

However, research success has not effectively translated into therapeutic success for human patients. This translational failure is partially due to the overuse of animal models that cannot accurately recapitulate human AD etiopathogenesis or drug responses and the inadequate use of human-relevant research methods. Here, we propose how to mitigate this translational barrier by employing human-based methods to elucidate disease processes occurring at multiple levels of complexity, accounting for gene and protein expression and the impact of disease at the cellular, tissue/organ, individual, and population levels. In particular, novel human-based cellular and computational models, together with epidemiological and clinical studies, represent the ideal tools to facilitate human-relevant data acquisition, in the effort to better elucidate AD pathogenesis in a human-based setting and design more effective treatments and preventive strategies. Our analysis indicates that a paradigm shift toward human-based, rather than animal-based research is required in the face of the ever-increasing prevalence of AD in the 21st century.",,"['Pistollato, Francesca', 'Cavanaugh, Sarah E', 'Chandrasekera, P Charukeshi']","['Pistollato F', 'Cavanaugh SE', 'Chandrasekera PC']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['*Alzheimer Disease/epidemiology/genetics/physiopathology', 'Animals', 'Biomedical Research/*methods', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans']",,,2015/09/25 06:00,2016/07/07 06:00,['2015/09/25 06:00'],"['2015/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['JAD150281 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-150281 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2015;47(4):857-68. doi: 10.3233/JAD-150281.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'animal models', 'biomarkers', 'computational methods', 'human-based methods', 'risk factors', 'stem cells', 'translational gap']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A random effects joint modeling approach was used to simultaneously model the baseline and longitudinal trajectory of each factor and predict the time to death, adjusting for demographic covariates. An ancillary analysis of ApoE varepsilon4 status as a predictor was also conducted. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed to elucidate the relationship between each factor and the estimated probability of death over time. Shorter survival was associated with male gender, higher education, older age, lower cognition, and worse functioning in daily life, but not ApoE varepsilon4 status. Longitudinal trajectories increased predictive power over using just baseline levels highlighting apathy, and secondarily aberrant motor behaviors and sleep disorders, as a highly reliable predictor for mortality. Apathy was the strongest neuropsychiatric predictor of time to death, which supports its role in the pathogenesis of the disorder.

Connectivity changes under the resting state condition especially in the internal connectivity network, named as the default mode network (DMN), are observed in AD. This paper aimed to investigate and discuss the findings on DMN connectivity. METHOD: The studies carried out by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), using the two most widely applied techniques, the seed-based method and independent component analysis (ICA), have been investigated. RESULTS: Studies generally indicate a progressive impairment in DMN connectivity during the course of AD. It has been also stated that DMN subsystems show differential connectivity patterns in the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD. There is also evidence suggesting that impairment in DMN connectivity could be associated with different connectivity patterns in other networks. Furthermore, findings point towards a relationship between DMN and AD-related neuropathology and genetic risk factors.

As a result, persons with Alzheimer's disease may have difficulty accessing the benefit of medical advances. In contrast to the long history and established structure for drug approval, payer decision making is dispersed, not standardized, and perspectives on necessary evidence and the evaluation of this evidence differ and are often poorly defined. Particularly challenging is how to demonstrate the value of drugs and diagnostics for patients who do not yet have significant functional decline. Although discussions to develop consensus continue, clinical trials should begin to incorporate health system and patient-oriented outcomes. In some situations, additional studies designed to demonstrate value and comparative effectiveness will be needed. Such studies should examine outcomes of representative populations in community settings. To assure scientific advances in diagnosis and treatment benefit in patients, developing evidence to support reimbursement will become as important as obtaining regulatory approval.","[""Copyright (c) 2014 The Alzheimer's Association.

It is unclear whether iVR is acceptable to people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia or useful in their care. We explore whether iVR is a viable research tool that may aid the detection and treatment of AD. OBJECTIVES: This review examines the use of iVR in people with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception. PRISMA guidelines were used with studies selected by at least two researchers. RESULTS: Nine studies were eligible for inclusion. None reported any issues with iVR tolerability in participants with MCI and AD on assessment or treatment tasks. One study demonstrated capability for detecting prodromal AD and correlated with neuroanatomical substrates. Two studies showed iVR to have high accuracy in differentiating participants with AD from controls but were not hypothesis driven or with adequate controls measures. In a small validation study and two longitudinal case studies, iVR cognitive training was positively rated but did not demonstrate reliable benefit. CONCLUSION: iVR is emerging as a viable method of assessing older adults and people with AD. Strongest benefits were seen when closely integrated with theoretical models of neurodegeneration and existing screening methods. Further randomized controlled trials integrated with clinical populations are required. This will consolidate the power of iVR for assessment of MCI and clarify treatment efficacy beyond current applications in physical rehabilitation.",,"['Clay, Felix', 'Howett, David', 'FitzGerald, James', 'Fletcher, Paul', 'Chan, Dennis', 'Price, Annabel']","['Clay F', 'Howett D', 'FitzGerald J', 'Fletcher P', 'Chan D', 'Price A']","['Cambridge and Peterborough Foundation Trust, Elizabeth House, Fulbourn Hospital Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'ARC East of England, Douglas House, Cambridge, UK.', 'University of Cambridge, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'Cambridge and Peterborough Foundation Trust, Elizabeth House, Fulbourn Hospital Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'ARC East of England, Douglas House, Cambridge, UK.', 'Cambridge and Peterborough Foundation Trust, Elizabeth House, Fulbourn Hospital Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'University of Cambridge, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, Alexandra House, London, UK.', 'Cambridge and Peterborough Foundation Trust, Elizabeth House, Fulbourn Hospital Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'ARC East of England, Douglas House, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],['DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*diagnosis/psychology/therapy', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/*diagnosis/psychology/therapy', 'Cognitive Remediation/*methods', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Spatial Navigation', '*Virtual Reality']",PMC7306888,,2020/04/14 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/04/14 06:00'],"['2020/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD191218 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-191218 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2020;75(1):23-43. doi: 10.3233/JAD-191218.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'cognitive remediation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'spatial navigation', 'virtual reality']","[""Authors' disclosures available online"", '(https://www.j-alz.com/manuscript-disclosures/19-1218r1).']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neuroesthetics is principally implemented by functional studies in normal subjects, but the neuropsychology of the aesthetic experience, that is, the impact of brain damage on the appreciation of works of art, is a neglected field. Here, 16 mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease patients and 15 caregivers expressed their preference on 16 works of art (eight representational and eight abstract) during programmed visits to an art gallery. A week later, all subjects expressed a preference rate on reproductions of the same works presented in the gallery. Both patients and caregivers were consistent in assigning preference ratings, and in patients consistency was independent of the ability to recognize the works on which the preference rate had been given in an explicit memory task. Caregivers performed at ceiling in the memory task. Both patients and caregivers assigned higher preference ratings for representational than for abstract works and preference consistency was comparable in representational and abstract works. Furthermore, in the memory task, patients did not recognize better artworks they had assigned higher preference ratings to, suggesting that emotional stimuli (as presumably visual works of art are) cannot enhance declarative memory in this pathology.

The disease pathology is characterized by the accumulation and aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides into extracellular plaques, however the factors that promote neurotoxic Abeta aggregation remain elusive. Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a powerful technique to comprehensively elucidate the spatial distribution patterns of lipids, peptides and proteins in biological tissues. In the present study, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS)-based imaging was used to study Abeta deposition in transgenic mouse brain tissue and to elucidate the plaque-associated chemical microenvironment. The imaging experiments were performed in brain sections of transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice carrying the Arctic and Swedish mutation of amyloid-beta precursor protein (tgArcSwe). Multivariate image analysis was used to interrogate the IMS data for identifying pathologically relevant, anatomical features based on their chemical identity. This include cortical and hippocampal Abeta deposits, whose amyloid peptide content was further verified using immunohistochemistry and laser microdissection followed by MALDI MS analysis. Subsequent statistical analysis on spectral data of regions of interest revealed brain region-specific differences in Abeta peptide aggregation. Moreover, other plaque-associated protein species were identified including macrophage migration inhibitory factor suggesting neuroinflammatory processes and glial cell reactivity to be involved in AD pathology. The presented data further highlight the potential of IMS as a powerful approach in neuropathology. Hanrieder et al. described an imaging mass spectrometry based study on comprehensive spatial profiling of C-terminally truncated Abeta species within individual plaques in tgArcSwe mice. Here, brain region-dependent differences in Abeta truncation and other plaque-associated proteins, such as macrophage migration inhibitory factor, were observed. The data shed further light on plaque-associated molecular mechanisms implicated in Alzheimer's pathogenesis.

Current proposals to revise Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnostic criteria incorporate diagnostic biomarkers. Such revisions would allow identification of persons with AD pathology before the onset of dementia. The population-level impact of screening for preclinical AD and treating with a disease-modifying agent is important when evaluating new biomarkers and medications. METHODS: A published computer simulation model assigned AD-related event times, such that delays in disease progression due to therapy effectiveness can be estimated for a preclinical AD cohort. Attributes such as screening sensitivity/specificity, treatment efficacy, age at first screening, and rescreening intervals were varied. Outcomes included incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI-AD), incident DAT, and number of patients recommended for treatment. RESULTS: One-time screening at age 65 years, 50% efficacy, and literature-based proxy persistence rates yielded 12.4% incidence of MCI-AD and 0.9% decrease in DAT incidence from base case of no screening/treatment. Modest reductions in incident MCI-AD and DAT were observed with more sensitive testing. Reducing specificity yielded greater reductions in MCI-AD and DAT cases, albeit by treating more patients. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis predicted that for a cohort of patients aged 65 years, the number that needed to be treated to avoid one AD case was 11.6 (range: 5.7-104). CONCLUSION: The reduction in MCI-AD and DAT depends on initial screening age, screening frequency, and specificity. When considering population-level impact of screening-treatment, the effect of these parameters on incidence would need to be weighed against the number of individuals screened and treated.","[""Copyright (c) 2012 The Alzheimer's Association.

Over 99% of AD patients suffer from the sporadic form of the disease. Based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta)(1-42), total tau, and ubiquitin--the markers associated with the histopathological hallmarks of the disease (Abeta plaques and abnormally hyperphosphorylated neurofibrillary tangles)--previous studies identified five subgroups of AD. Here we report the potential diagnostic predictive value of hallucination, hypokinesia, paranoia, rigidity, and tremors in aged individuals for AD and differences in the prevalence of these symptoms in the CSF marker-based subgroups of the disease. Analysis of 196 clinically diagnosed AD or Alzheimer with Lewy body, and 75 non-AD neurological and non-neurological control cases, all from a single center, showed that the presence of hallucination, hypokinesia, paranoia, rigidity, or tremors individually, or the presence of any of these, could diagnose AD with sensitivities and specificities of 14% and 99%; 30% and 99%; 15% and 99%; 16% and 100%; 16% and 96%; and 47% and 92%, respectively. The pattern of the prevalence of the above symptoms varied from AD subgroup to subgroup. Presence of any of these symptoms, as well as presence of each individual symptom except tremors, significantly differentiated AD subgroups from the predominantly control cluster. These findings encourage the exploration of hallucination, hypokinesia, paranoia, rigidity, and tremors in identifying various subgroups of AD for stratification of patients for clinical trials to develop therapeutic drugs.

We therefore investigated the impact of cognitive deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly apathy, on facial expression in AD. While overall neuropsychiatric symptoms were not associated with facial expression, apathy exhibited substantial correlations, even after controlling for cognitive deficits. Moreover, apathy appeared to moderate the influence of cognitive deficits: without considering apathy, cognitive deficits were associated with less specific facial expressions. After controlling for apathy, cognitive decline was related to increased facial expressiveness.

Over the short term, the use of antibodies administered intravenously with serial MRIs to detect amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) may require participation in structured phase 4 studies or in registries with third party funding for support staff and MRI scans. In the mid term, the availability of oral anti-amyloid therapy, likely with lower risk of ARIA, may transform clinical practice to a model of screening suitable patients using plasma biomarkers, with a subsequent rapid referral to a specialized memory clinic.

Identifying altered neuronal gene expression in brain regions differentially affected by AD may provide the diagnostic or therapeutic targets of AD. METHODS: The gene expression profile of AD was analyzed with bioinformatics. Function analysis was performed with Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), and TransFind was used to predict the possible transcriptional regulators in AD. Finally, connectivity map (cMap) database was used to explore small molecules targeted for AD. RESULTS: The AD gene signatures associated with 6 different brain regions were identified. Functional analysis revealed that biological processes involved with metabolism, protein ubiquitination, and vasculature development were found dysregulated, and synaptic signaling pathways were found perturbated in AD. The WT1 was identified as an important transcriptional regulator in AD, and cMap database predicted that small molecules, such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, may be candidate drugs in the treatment of AD. CONCLUSION: According to our in silico analysis, Wilms' tumor suppressor may play regulatory roles in AD development and progress. The HDAC inhibitor could possibly be used to treat AD.",,"['Chen, Fei', 'Guan, Qiang', 'Nie, Zhi-Yu', 'Jin, Ling-Jing']","['Chen F', 'Guan Q', 'Nie ZY', 'Jin LJ']","['1Department of Neurology, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen,American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias,101082834,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Signal Transduction', 'Synapses/metabolism', 'Transcriptome/*genetics/physiology']",,,2013/09/06 06:00,2014/08/05 06:00,['2013/09/06 06:00'],"['2013/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1533317513500838 [pii]', '10.1177/1533317513500838 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen. 2013 Nov;28(7):693-701. doi: 10.1177/1533317513500838.

This increased anxiety could be associated with decreased sensorimotor gating with increased attention to significant stimuli from AD pathology in the entorhinal cortex. We investigated whether widening initial attention to socioemotional stimuli was association with anxiety among 16 patients with first stage EOAD compared to 19 normal controls (NCs). The participants underwent assessment of their initial heart rate deceleration (""orienting response""; OR), a measure of attentional refocusing, to pictures (International Affective Picture Stimuli) varying in pleasant-unpleasant valence and social-nonsocial content. The results showed group differences; the EOAD patients had significantly larger ORs than the NCs across conditions, with larger ORs in each valence and social condition. In addition, the EOAD patients, but not the NCs, showed ORs to normally less threatening stimuli, particularly pleasant, but also less significantly, social stimuli. On the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, the ORs among the EOAD patients significantly correlated with anxiety scores. Together, these findings suggest that anxiety in mild EOAD may be associated with widening attentional refocusing to socioemotional stimuli, possibly reflecting decreased sensorimotor gating in the entorhinal cortex.

METHODS: We used data from the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS) Cohort exams 5 through 9. Fructose consumption was quantified using a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at cohort examinations 5 and participants were dementia-free at baseline. Surveillance for incident events commenced at examination 9 through 2014. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios for the association between fructose consumption and incidence of all-cause dementia and AD dementia. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 15.2 (interquartile range, 12.3-17.1) years (31715.1 person-years), there were 233 dementia events of which 163 were AD dementia (70.0%). After multivariate adjustments, individuals with the highest consumption of fructose had a higher risk of all-cause dementia, and AD dementia when comparing daily cumulative consumption to 0 per week (reference), with HRs of 1.49 (95% 1.14-1.84, P for trend < 0.001) for all-cause dementia, and 1.60 (95%CI 1.22-2.01, P-trend < 0.001) for AD dementia.

All participants also reported reminiscence ""to reduce boredom"" and ""for something to do"". However, reminiscence for death preparation and boredom reduction was reported more by AD participants than by older adults. In all participants, the death preparation function of reminiscence was significantly correlated with depression. Individuals with AD seem to reminiscence to cope with thoughts about their own mortality. This helps them to see that they have lived a full life and can therefore accept death more calmly.

Most descriptions of senile dementia date back to Alois Alzheimer. In 1906, Alzheimer described the first patient, Auguste Deter, who suffered from the disorder that later became known as Alzheimer's disease. Although, the history of the disease before 1906 is quite rich, little has been said about the contributions of ancient and medieval physicians to the understanding of dementia. Over the centuries, the concept of senile dementia changed from an inevitable mental decline with aging, to different sets of clinical features with narrow limits of diagnosis of a disease in its own right. Documentation of the historical origins of prevention, diagnosis, and therapies of dementia would make an important contribution to a more complete understanding of this pathological degeneration of dementia. The present review focuses on the contributions of Avicenna (AD 980-1037) to the development of diagnosis and the discovery of etiology of different forms of dementia, with the goal of revealing the extent to which dementia was understood in the golden age of Islam in Persia.",,"['Taheri-Targhi, Somaiyeh', 'Gjedde, Albert', 'Araj-Khodaei, Mostafa', 'Rikhtegar, Reza', 'Parsian, Zahra', 'Zarrintan, Sina', 'Torbati, Mohammadali', 'Vafaee, Manouchehr Seyedi']","['Taheri-Targhi S', 'Gjedde A', 'Araj-Khodaei M', 'Rikhtegar R', 'Parsian Z', 'Zarrintan S', 'Torbati M', 'Vafaee MS']","['Aging Research Institute, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Aging Research Institute, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Persian Medicine, Faculty of Traditional Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Aging Research Institute, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Emergency Medicine Research Team, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Division of Vascular & Endovascular Surgery, Department of General & Vascular Surgery, Shohada-Tajrish Medical Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of nutrition, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['*Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/history/psychology', 'History, Medieval', 'Humans', 'Persia']",,,2019/09/17 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2019/09/17 06:00'],"['2019/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD190345 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-190345 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2019;71(4):1093-1098. doi: 10.3233/JAD-190345.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Avicenna', 'Persian medicine', 'dementia', 'history of medicine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We analyzed a large (N = 45) monocenter expert-clinic CBS cohort, recruited in motor and/or cognitive units to avoid recruitment biases, assessed with standardized motor and/or cognitive-language tests, brain perfusion imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. RESULTS: CBS mainly manifests as a motor and/or language disorder incorporating a ""mixed progressive aphasia"" phenotype, consistent with left-lateralized damage to frontal-parietal-temporal cortices. Biomarker expression indicates in 18% underlying AD causing predominant parietal-temporal damage and Gerstmann syndrome (sensitivity 75%; specificity 75%), whereas non-AD-CBS presented with predominant prefrontal and lexical-semantic impairment. DISCUSSION: CBS is primarily a ""motor-plus-aphasia"" disease unfolding into AD-related and non-AD-related variants with distinctive cognitive-anatomic patterns. CBS, and notably its ""Gerstmann variant"", should be included in the new AD ""lexicon"" and categorized in the evolving diagnostic spectrum of ""atypical AD""d.","[""Copyright (c) 2016 The Alzheimer's Association.

Here, we propose a model-driven approach supporting the systematic identification of putative disease mechanisms. METHODS: We have created a model for AD and a corresponding model for the normal physiology of neurons using biological expression language to systematically model causal and correlative relationships between biomolecules, pathways, and clinical readouts. Through model-model comparison we identify ""chains of causal relationships"" that lead to new insights into putative disease mechanisms. RESULTS: Using differential analysis of our models we identified a new mechanism explaining the effect of amyloid-beta on apoptosis via both the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor, type 2 and nerve growth factor receptor branches of the neurotrophin signaling pathway. We also provide the example of a model-guided interpretation of genetic variation data for a comorbidity analysis between AD and type 2 diabetes mellitus. DISCUSSION: The two computable, literature-based models introduced here provide a powerful framework for the generation and validation of rational, testable hypotheses across disease areas.",['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

To the contrary, this report presents the first evidence that long-term EMF exposure directly associated with cell phone use (918 MHz; 0.25 w/kg) provides cognitive benefits. Both cognitive-protective and cognitive-enhancing effects of EMF exposure were discovered for both normal mice and transgenic mice destined to develop Alzheimer's-like cognitive impairment. The cognitive interference task utilized in this study was designed from, and measure-for-measure analogous to, a human cognitive interference task. In Alzheimer's disease mice, long-term EMF exposure reduced brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition through Abeta anti-aggregation actions and increased brain temperature during exposure periods. Several inter-related mechanisms of EMF action are proposed, including increased Abeta clearance from the brains of Alzheimer's disease mice, increased neuronal activity, and increased cerebral blood flow. Although caution should be taken in extrapolating these mouse studies to humans, we conclude that EMF exposure may represent a non-invasive, non-pharmacologic therapeutic against Alzheimer's disease and an effective memory-enhancing approach in general.",,"['Arendash, Gary W', 'Sanchez-Ramos, Juan', 'Mori, Takashi', 'Mamcarz, Malgorzata', 'Lin, Xiaoyang', 'Runfeldt, Melissa', 'Wang, Li', 'Zhang, Guixin', 'Sava, Vasyl', 'Tan, Jun', 'Cao, Chuanhai']","['Arendash GW', 'Sanchez-Ramos J', 'Mori T', 'Mamcarz M', 'Lin X', 'Runfeldt M', 'Wang L', 'Zhang G', 'Sava V', 'Tan J', 'Cao C']","[""The Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Tampa, FL, USA. arendash@cas.usf.edu""]",['eng'],['AG025711/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/complications/psychology/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Cognition Disorders/complications/*prevention & control/psychology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Magnetic Field Therapy/*methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic']",,,2010/01/12 06:00,2010/08/11 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['T3107113X861377U [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-2010-1228 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2010;19(1):191-210. doi: 10.3233/JAD-2010-1228.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it can certainly be edifying to study the ""great men"" and how their contributions laid the foundation for current work, there are problems with this approach to history. First, it oversimplifies the actual historical development of science. Second, using history to legitimate the present can keep us from asking critical questions about the aims and limits of contemporary research. This chapter urges a broader view of the history of AD, one that recognizes that context is as important as the great doctors to the historical development of the concept of AD. Thought of this way, I argue that it is useful to divide of the history of AD into three periods. First there was the period in which Alzheimer and Kraepelin laid the clinical and pathological foundations of the disease concept. Then there is our own period, which began in the late 1970s and has emphasized the biological mechanisms of dementia. In between, there is the period - almost completely ignored in most histories of AD--that conceptualized dementia in psychodynamic terms. It is true that the psychodynamic model of dementia did not directly contribute to the concepts and theories that dominate AD research today. But it did change the context of aging and dementia in important ways, without which AD could not have emerged as a major disease worthy of a massive, publicly supported research initiative.",,"['Ballenger, Jesse F']",['Ballenger JF'],"['Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aged', 'Aging/psychology', 'Alzheimer Disease/*history/*pathology/psychology', 'Brain/*pathology', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Social Adjustment', '*Social Environment']",,,2006/09/29 09:00,2006/10/20 09:00,['2006/09/29 09:00'],"['2006/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3233/jad-2006-9s302 [doi]'],ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2006;9(3 Suppl):5-13. doi: 10.3233/jad-2006-9s302.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approval of anti-amyloid antibody therapies is a significant milestone for treatment that was enabled by the inclusion of biomarkers.

This review discusses emerging biomarkers associated with the biology of aging and their application in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Aging is the primary risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease and is associated with biological processes implicated in disease development and progression. Novel therapies targeting these underlying biological aging processes are currently undergoing clinical development. Biomarkers that capture the biology of aging are integral to accelerating the development of these therapies. Current progress in biomarker development demonstrates efforts to capture the full spectrum of aging biology. Further work is needed to expand the range of biomarkers that enable comprehensive assessment of brain pathology and aid in prognosis, diagnosis, and measuring treatment response.

We are still behind in AD research in terms of knowledge regarding understanding its pathophysiology and designing therapeutics because of the lack of an accurate animal model for AD. A complete animal model of AD should imitate all the cognitive, behavioral, and neuropathological features of the disease.

There is new interest in the idea, however, that it is not neuronal degeneration that leads to decreased CBF to critical neurons, but it is the decrease in CBF which is the cause of the neuronal deterioration seen in AD patients. In order to increase CBF to the AD brain, an operation called omental transposition has been developed in which an intact elongated omental pedicle, when placed directly on the brain, provides additional CBF and other biological nutrients to the brain. It is understandable that AD patients are awaiting a method to control their disease, but this may take years to become available. Placing the omentum on the AD brain has demonstrated increased CBF which may be the reason that several studies have shown that omental transposition to the brain can improve the cognitive ability of AD patients who have undergone the operation.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), where there is a clear deficit of recollection, the evidence regarding familiarity is mixed, with some studies showing preserved familiarity and others reporting impairment. The current study examined whether recognition memory performance can be improved in AD when the use of familiarity is facilitated by the salience of processing fluency due to an earlier encounter with the information. Fifteen AD patients and 16 healthy controls performed a verbal recognition memory task where the salience of fluency was manipulated by means of letters overlap. Studied and unstudied words were constituted of either two separate sets of letters (no-overlap condition, high fluency salience) or the same set of letters (overlap condition, low fluency salience). The results showed that, although performance was globally poorer in AD patients than in the controls, both groups performed significantly better in the no-overlap condition than in the overlap condition.

In the pathophysiology of AD immune responses deviate and infectious side effects are observed during memantine therapy. However, the particular effects of memantine on human T lymphocytes are unresolved. Here, we provide evidence that memantine blocks Kv1.3 potassium channels, inhibits CD3-antibody- and alloantigen-induced proliferation and suppresses chemokine-induced migration of peripheral blood T cells of healthy donors. Concurrent with the in vitro data, CD4+ T cells from AD patients receiving therapeutic doses of memantine show a transient decline of Kv1.3 channel activity and a long-lasting reduced proliferative response to alloantigens in mixed lymphocyte reactions. Furthermore, memantine treatment provokes a profound depletion of peripheral blood memory CD45RO+ CD4+ T cells. Thus, standard doses of memantine profoundly reduce T cell responses in treated patients through blockade of Kv1.3 channels. This may normalize deviant immunopathology in AD and contribute to the beneficial effects of memantine, but may also account for the enhanced infection rate.",,"['Lowinus, Theresa', 'Bose, Tanima', 'Busse, Stefan', 'Busse, Mandy', 'Reinhold, Dirk', 'Schraven, Burkhart', 'Bommhardt, Ursula H H']","['Lowinus T', 'Bose T', 'Busse S', 'Busse M', 'Reinhold D', 'Schraven B', 'Bommhardt UH']","['Institute of Molecular and Clinical Immunology, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Molecular Physiology, Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Current address: Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Singapore.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Pulmonology & Allergology, Medical University of Hannover, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular and Clinical Immunology, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular and Clinical Immunology, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Immune Control, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular and Clinical Immunology, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['*Alzheimer Disease/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation/*drug effects', 'Kv1.3 Potassium Channel/*drug effects', 'Memantine/*pharmacology', 'Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology']",PMC5288222,,2016/07/28 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10777 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10777 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 16;7(33):53797-53807. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10777.,['NOTNLM'],"['Alzheimer s disease', 'Kv1.3 potassium channel', 'NMDA receptor antagonist', 'human T cells', 'memantine']",['The authors declare having no conflicts of interest.'],,,"['0 (Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Kv1.3 Potassium Channel)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', 'W8O17SJF3T (Memantine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We created a web-based application of the AD prevalence model developed by Brookmeyer et al (Am J Public Health 1998;88:1337-42; Alzheimers Dement 2007;3:186-91). The user defines the disease parameters and any interventions that may either reduce risk or slow disease progression. We expanded the parameters to include the cost and weights for disability-adjusted life years. APPLICATION: The secure, web-based application generates detailed AD projections for each calendar year to 2050, and allows users to create personal accounts for them to save, retrieve, and modify the input parameters. The flexibility of the application is illustrated with a forecast for the state of Maryland, USA.

The performance of anti-Abeta antibodies in transgenic mice models of AD showed they are delivered to the central nervous system (CNS), preventing and/or dissolving Abeta. Moreover, these antibodies protected the mice from learning and age-related memory deficits. Development of such antibodies via active and/or passive immunization against Abeta peptide fragments has been proposed for AD immunotherapeutic strategies. Experimental active immunization with fibrillar Abeta 1-42 in hu-mans was stopped in phase II clinical trials due to unexpected neuroinflammatory manifestations.

However, the benefit of using biomarkers has not been clearly demonstrated in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a combination of biomarkers may be helpful in classifying a population of non-demented patients attending a Memory Clinic. METHODS: Sixty non-demented patients were compared with 31 healthy elderly subjects. All subjects underwent a neuropsychological examination, brain 3T magnetic resonance imaging, [F18]-fluorodeoxyglucose and [F18]-flutemetamol positron emission tomography. According to their performance on memory, language, executive, and visuo-spatial domains, the patients were classified as mild cognitive impairment (amnestic, non-amnestic, single, or multiple domain) or subjective cognitive impairment. Patients were then classified according to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria, using the normalized mean hippocampal volume (Freesurfer), [F18]-FDG PALZAD, and [F18]-flutemetamol standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) (cut-off at the 10th percentile of controls). The standard of truth was the clinical status at study entry (patient versus control). RESULTS: The sensitivity/specificity of the clinical classification was 65/84%. The NIA-AA criteria were applicable in 85% of patients and 87% of controls. For biomarkers the best sensitivity (72%) at a fixed specificity of 84% was achieved by a combination of the three biomarkers. The clinical diagnosis was reconsidered in more than one third of the patients (42%) as a result of including the biomarker results. CONCLUSIONS: Application of the new NIA-AA AD diagnostic criteria based on biomarkers in an unselected sample of non-demented patients attending a Memory Clinic was useful in allowing for a better classification of the subjects.",,"['Ivanoiu, Adrian', 'Dricot, Laurence', 'Gilis, Nathalie', 'Grandin, Cecile', 'Lhommel, Renaud', 'Quenon, Lisa', 'Hanseeuw, Bernard']","['Ivanoiu A', 'Dricot L', 'Gilis N', 'Grandin C', 'Lhommel R', 'Quenon L', 'Hanseeuw B']","['Neurology Department, Saint Luc University Hospital, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium Institute of Neuroscience, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Institute of Neuroscience, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Neurology Department, Saint Luc University Hospital, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Radiology Department, Saint Luc University Hospital, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium Institute of Neuroscience, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Nuclear Medicine Department, Saint Luc University Hospital, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Institute of Neuroscience, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Neurology Department, Saint Luc University Hospital, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium Institute of Neuroscience, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aged', 'Alzheimer Disease/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/psychology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/psychology', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', '*Memory', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,,2014/08/13 06:00,2015/08/22 06:00,['2014/08/13 06:00'],"['2014/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['L8435321T3830X76 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-140651 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2015;43(3):835-47. doi: 10.3233/JAD-140651.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'biological markers', 'early diagnosis', 'mild cognitive impairment']",,,,['0 (Biomarkers)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PCA patients were significantly more impaired in visual perception, spatial memory, visual attention, and visuospatial reasoning compared to the PAD patients who were relatively more impaired in episodic memory. In the PCA group, no test score correlated with disease duration or age of clinical onset, whereas, in the PAD group, several scores correlated with disease duration.

These neuroprotective mechanisms work in concert to regulate metabolic homeostasis in healthy neuronal cells, but contribute to the distinctive cytopathic phenotype of neuronal degeneration in AD. According to this model, two molecular/genetic hallmarks of AD, amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation, are associated with neuronal mechanisms for dissipating thermal energy associated with high levels of protein synthesis in highly temperature-sensitive neuronal cells. Development of effective methods of AD treatment will require a better understanding of how this neuronal defense system is activated in response to cytopathological triggers in sporadic AD. The cause and effect link between synthesis and processing of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) and the AD terminal phenotype of neurofibrillary tangles and neuron loss involve the formation of Abeta peptides that accumulate as oligomers, cannot be controlled by neurons, and are toxic to the surrounding neuronal membranes. We analyze experimental and clinical studies that have investigated the correlation between phosphorylation of some transport proteins and increased synthesis of proteins in neurons. We also review the evidence related to the possibility that protein hyperphosphorylation may be a byproduct of energetic imbalances in AD cells associated with high levels of protein synthesis, and that activation of defense systems, through which energy-rich molecules are eliminated from the site of protein synthesis and are sequestered to the peripheral neuronal areas, may bring about some of the distinctive morphological features of AD.",,"['Maltsev, Alexander V', 'Santockyte, Rasa', 'Bystryak, Simon', 'Galzitskaya, Oxana V']","['Maltsev AV', 'Santockyte R', 'Bystryak S', 'Galzitskaya OV']","['Russian Gerontological Research Clinical Center, Russian Ministry of Health Care, Moscow, Russia Institute of Experimental and Theoretical Biophysics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Pushchino, Moscow Region, Russia.', 'Allied Innovative Systems, LLC, Hillsborough, NJ, USA.', 'Allied Innovative Systems, LLC, Hillsborough, NJ, USA.', 'Institute of Protein Research, Russian Academy of Sciences, Pushchino, Moscow Region, Russia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/complications/*etiology/*pathology', 'Amyloidosis/*complications', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Virulence Factors/toxicity']",,,2013/12/19 06:00,2014/10/31 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['8KV6J63431401463 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-131562 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2014;40(1):19-32. doi: 10.3233/JAD-131562.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'amyloid-beta protein precursor', 'amyloidosis', 'cellular defense factors', 'hyperphosphorylation', 'neuron loss', 'phosphorylation', 'tau protein']",,,,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathology of AD is complex, beginning many years before clinical symptoms are detectable, with multiple potential opportunities for therapeutic engagement. Introducing treatment strategies early in the disease and assessing meaningful change over the course of an 18-month clinical trial are critical to understanding the value to an effective intervention. With new clinical trial data expected soon on emerging therapeutics from several AD studies, the Alzheimer's Association convened a work group of experts to discuss key considerations for interpreting data from cognitive and functional measures and what is considered a clinically meaningful benefit or meaningful slowing of this fatal disease.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional, observational study, a control group and four experimental groups (SCD, non-amnestic MCI, amnesticMCI, AD) were compared. Neuropsychological measurers (NTBV) and psychological questionnaires were used for data collection. RESULTS: The control group scored higher than patients with SCD, naMCI, aMCI, or AD for the Mental Health Component Score (MHCS) of the Short Form of the Health Survey (SF-36). The Physical Health Component Score (PHCS) of the SF-36 differed only between some groups. Furthermore, cognitive variables were more strongly associated with the physical aspects of HRQOL, whereas depressive symptoms were more strongly related with the mental aspects of HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL and depressive symptoms are closely related in patients with cognitive impairments.

Very few treatments are in hand for the management of AD and they are only concentrating on peculiar aspects. Hence, an immense thrust is required to find utmost therapeutic targets to conquer this condition. This study investigates a potential role of vanillin, a selective agonist of transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1) in the experimental models of AD viz. intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) streptozotocin (STZ) and aluminum trichloride (AlCl3)+d-galactose induced AD in mice. The i.c.v. administration of STZ and intraperitoneally administration of AlCl3+d-galactose have significantly impaired learning-memory (Morris water maze and attentional set-shifting test), brain structure (hematoxylin, eosin and Congo red staining), enhanced brain oxidative stress (thiobarbituric acid reactive substance - TBARS and glutathione - GSH), nitrosative stress (nitrite/nitrate), acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE), inflammation (MPO), and calcium levels (Ca(++)). Treatment with vanillin in different doses and donepezil have significantly ameliorated i.c.v. STZ and AlCl3+d-galactose induced reduction in executive function, impaired reversal learning, cognition, memory and brain damage. Treatment with these drugs has also reduced the brain oxidative stress (TBARS and GSH), nitrosative stress (nitrite/nitrate), and AChE, MPO, and Ca(++) levels. These results indicate that vanillin, a selective agonist of TRPV1 and donepezil, a potent acetylcholine esterase inhibitor have attenuated i.c.v. STZ and AlCl3+d-galactose induced experimental AD. Hence, pharmacological positive modulation of TRPV1 channels may be a potential research target for mitigation of AD.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Prospective memory (PM), or the ability to create and carry out future intentions, is one cognitive domain that is impaired in individuals with dementia-related disorders. Effective treatment of PM could significantly improve daily functioning, level of independence, and quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To date, there have been a number of studies investigating potential interventions, but these interventions have not been comprehensively reviewed and compared across the stages of dementia-related disorders, as is the aim of the current review. METHODS: This review examined 21 studies on the success of intervention strategies for prospective memory in patients with dementia-related disorders. RESULTS: All the studies demonstrated positive effects of intervention on PM abilities, but there are questions concerning ecological validity, length of positive effects on PM, and a lack of diversity of interventions across the different stages of dementia-related disorders. CONCLUSION: Future research should address these issues by incorporating daily functioning activities and caregiver support into the intervention process, as well as investigating these interventions at more severe stages of dementia-related disorders.",,"['Rice, Michaela', 'Davalos, Deana', 'Thomas, Michael L']","['Rice M', 'Davalos D', 'Thomas ML']","['Cognitive Neuroscience Program, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA.', 'Cognitive Neuroscience Program, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA.', 'Cognitive Neuroscience Program, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA.']",['eng'],,['Systematic Review'],Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['*Alzheimer Disease/complications/psychology/therapy', '*Cognitive Dysfunction/psychology', '*Frontotemporal Dementia/psychology', 'Humans', '*Memory, Episodic', 'Quality of Life']",,,2022/02/12 06:00,2022/04/14 06:00,['2022/02/11 12:12'],"['2022/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/04/14 06:00 [medline]', '2022/02/11 12:12 [entrez]']","['JAD215473 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-215473 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2022;86(3):1001-1024. doi: 10.3233/JAD-215473.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'dementia', 'intervention', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'prospective memory']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little evidence exists for a contribution of the adaptive immune response in AD, as no signs of influx of blood borne cells or presence of immunoglobulins in Abeta deposits are apparent. Factors of the complement(C) system and pentraxins act as pattern recognition molecules and mediate uptake of Abeta by glial cells expressing C-receptors (Crec). These interactions may, however, also lead to synthesis and secretion of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytokines, chemokines and other potentially neurotoxic agents by the glial cells. Virtually all complement factors are produced in brain, and the expression is increased in AD affected brain areas. In AD brain areas with amyloid deposits especially classical pathway C activation products are readily observed. Also C regulatory proteins (Creg) and Crec can be found in the brain parenchyma and are upregulated, especially under acute inflammatory conditions, such as meningitis. However, under chronic low-grade inflammatory conditions, such as in AD, Creg and to some extent Crec expression may remain at a low level, thereby allowing C activation to proceed, leading to sustained activation of glial cells and neurodegenerative changes. In this review evidence from immunohistochemical, in vitro and animal studies pointing to a role for C activation is discussed, with special focus on the disturbed balance between C activators and Cregs in AD.",,"['Veerhuis, Robert']",['Veerhuis R'],"['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Alzheimer Center, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. r.veerhuis@vumc.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Alzheimer Res,Current Alzheimer research,101208441,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*complications/immunology/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Central Nervous System/metabolism', 'Complement System Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', '*Inflammation/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Plaque, Amyloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Proteomics', 'Receptors, Complement/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/07/02 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CAR /0108 [pii]', '10.2174/156720511794604589 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Alzheimer Res. 2011 Feb;8(1):34-58. doi: 10.2174/156720511794604589.,,,,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",,,['Curr Alzheimer Res. 2011 Feb;8(1):32-3.

Whether such shifts have reached the very old is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate temporal trends in the incidence of dementia and cognitive impairment and prevalence of dementia, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and unclassified dementia among 85-, 90-, and >/= 95-year-olds in Sweden during 2000-2017. METHODS: This study was conducted with Umea 85 + /Gerontological Regional Database data from 2182 85-, 90-, and >/= 95-year-olds in Sweden collected in 2000-2017. Using logistic regression, trends in the cumulative 5-year incidences of dementia and cognitive impairment; prevalences of dementia, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia; and Mini-Mental State Examination thresholds for dementia diagnosis were estimated. RESULTS: Dementia and cognitive impairment incidences decreased in younger groups, which generally showed more-positive temporal trends. The prevalences of overall dementia, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease were stable or increasing; longer disease durations and increasing dementia subtype classification success may mask positive changes in incidences. Vascular dementia increased while unclassified dementia generally decreased. CONCLUSION: The cognitive health of the very old may be changing in the 21st century, possibly indicating a trend break.",,"['Weidung, Bodil', 'Lovheim, Hugo', 'Littbrand, Hakan', 'Wahlin, Johanna', 'Olofsson, Birgitta', 'Gustafson, Yngve']","['Weidung B', 'Lovheim H', 'Littbrand H', 'Wahlin J', 'Olofsson B', 'Gustafson Y']","['Department of Public Health and Caring Sciences, Section of Geriatrics, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Community Medicine and Rehabilitation, Division of Geriatic Medicine, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Community Medicine and Rehabilitation, Division of Geriatic Medicine, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Community Medicine and Rehabilitation, Division of Geriatic Medicine, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Nursing, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Surgical and Perioperative Sciences, Division of Orthopedics, UmeaUniversity, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Community Medicine and Rehabilitation, Division of Geriatic Medicine, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Humans', '*Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology', '*Dementia, Vascular/epidemiology', '*Cognitive Dysfunction/epidemiology', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",PMC10200221,,2023/03/21 06:00,2023/05/09 06:42,['2023/03/20 05:03'],"['2023/05/09 06:42 [medline]', '2023/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/03/20 05:03 [entrez]']","['JAD220915 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-220915 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2023;93(1):61-74. doi: 10.3233/JAD-220915.,['NOTNLM'],"['Aged 80 and over', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'cognition disorders', 'cohort studies', 'cross-sectional studies', 'dementia', 'epidemiologic studies', 'longitudinal studies', 'neurocognitive disorders', 'vascular dementia']",['The authors have no conflict of interest to report.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite decades of intensive research and scientific advances, the intricate pathogenic mechanisms of AD are still not fully understood and, consequently, an effective treatment is yet to be developed. As widely accepted, the alterations of mitochondrial function are actively engaged in a plethora of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. With growing interest in the mitochondria as a potential target for understanding AD, it has even been hypothesized that deficits in these organelles may be at the heart of the progression of AD itself. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to summarize relevant studies that suggest a role for mitochondrial (dys)function in AD and to provide a survey on latest developments regarding AD-related mitochondrial therapeutics. Expert commentary: As outlined in a plethora of studies, there is no doubt that mitochondria play a major role in several stages of AD progression.

Here we examine the rate of reversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to normal cognition (NC) and explore a set of potential variables associated with this phenomenon. METHODS: A total of 985 Spanish community-dwelling individuals aged 70 years and over at baseline were monitored for 5 years. During this time, 173 MCI and 36 dementia cases were identified. Multi-state Markov models were performed to characterize transitions between states through the dementia continuum. RESULTS: The rate of reversion from MCI to NC was 11%. There were significant non-modifiable (age, socioeconomic status, or apolipoprotein E) and modifiable factors (cognitive training or absence of affective symptoms) associated with reversion. DISCUSSION: Overall, our results highlight that the likelihood of progression from MCI to dementia is very similar to that of reversion from MCI to NC.","[""(c) 2021 the Alzheimer's Association.""]","['Sanz-Blasco, Ruben', 'Ruiz-Sanchez de Leon, Jose M', 'Avila-Villanueva, Marina', 'Valenti-Soler, Meritxel', 'Gomez-Ramirez, Jaime', 'Fernandez-Blazquez, Miguel A']","['Sanz-Blasco R', 'Ruiz-Sanchez de Leon JM', 'Avila-Villanueva M', 'Valenti-Soler M', 'Gomez-Ramirez J', 'Fernandez-Blazquez MA']","['Department of Experimental Psychology, Complutense University of Madrid (UCM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Experimental Psychology, Complutense University of Madrid (UCM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Alzheimer Disease Research Unit, CIEN Foundation, Carlos III Institute of Health, Queen Sofia Foundation Alzheimer Center, Madrid, Spain.', 'Alzheimer Disease Research Unit, CIEN Foundation, Carlos III Institute of Health, Queen Sofia Foundation Alzheimer Center, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Cadiz (INIBICA), Department of Psychology, Universidad de Cadiz, Cadiz, Spain.', 'Department of Experimental Psychology, Complutense University of Madrid (UCM), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Alzheimers Dement,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/psychology', 'Cognition', '*Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnosis/psychology', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Neuropsychological Tests']",,,2021/09/06 06:00,2022/06/09 06:00,['2021/09/05 21:09'],"['2021/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/05 21:09 [entrez]']",['10.1002/alz.12448 [doi]'],ppublish,Alzheimers Dement. 2022 Jun;18(6):1177-1185. doi: 10.1002/alz.12448.

Although a large number of in vitro studies have highlighted its functional importance, as yet not enough is known about the clinical importance of the genetic background of LRP1 in human diseases. The aim of this ex vivo/in vivo study of 448 subjects was to present data on genetic LRP1 variants of healthy European Caucasians from Central Germany. Genotype-dependent LRP1 expression was analyzed in a representative subgroup (gene expression: n = 127, protein expression: n = 44). These data were evaluated in comparison to other published clinical LRP1 studies. For 15 functionally interesting genetic variants the genotype and allele distributions of the German Caucasians were presented in relation to their in vivo LRP1 gene and protein expression. A direct influence of the LRP1 promoter polymorphism c.1-25C>G on the human in vivo LRP1 expression level was demonstrated. In an analysis of 48 further studies genomic and functional results were evaluated. The analysis especially on Alzheimers's disease partly highlighted contradictory results, but suggested that ethnic as well as genomic characteristics determine LRP1 expression and must be considered in clinical investigations on human LRP1.",,"['Glaser, Christiane', 'Schulz, Susanne', 'Handschug, Katrin', 'Huse, Klaus', 'Birkenmeier, Gerd']","['Glaser C', 'Schulz S', 'Handschug K', 'Huse K', 'Birkenmeier G']","['Institute of Human Genetics and Medical Biology, University of Halle, Magdeburger Str. 2, D-06097 Halle, Germany. christiane.glaeser@medizin.uni-halle.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Neurosci Res,Neuroscience research,8500749,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Alzheimer Disease/*blood/ethnology/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Genetic Markers/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genetic Testing', 'Genetic Variation/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Germany/ethnology', 'Humans', 'Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-1/*blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics', 'White People/genetics']",,,2004/08/04 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/08/04 05:00'],"['2004/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['S016801020400118X [pii]', '10.1016/j.neures.2004.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurosci Res. 2004 Sep;50(1):85-101. doi: 10.1016/j.neures.2004.06.001.,,,,,,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, AD patients showed a higher number of sources over the frontal motor areas, including Broca's and the insula. The number of activity sources on the left parietal areas in response to the target stimuli predicted the AD score oncognitive (MMSE, CAMCOG) and functional staging (FAST) scales.

Concurrently, a preponderance of evidence emerging from basic and clinical research in diverse fields such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and mental health has suggested that the environmental component of clinical AD is not only multifactorial in populations and in individuals, but is also modifiable across the life-course, from conception until death. Re-conceptualizing the environmental component of AD to account for these observations necessitates an approach to brain health that eschews singular, short- and medium-term methodology and instead reflects long-term complexity. Such thinking is consistent with the ecological models of public health, which emphasize the development of community infrastructure that can foster population and individual health over the life-course by minimizing risk through multifaceted, systemic approaches.",,"[""D'Alton, Simon"", 'Hunter, Sally', 'Whitehouse, Peter', 'Brayne, Carol', 'George, Daniel']","[""D'Alton S"", 'Hunter S', 'Whitehouse P', 'Brayne C', 'George D']","['Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neuroscience, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Institute of Public Health, Forvie Site, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Institute of Public Health, Forvie Site, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Humanities, Penn State Milton S Hershey Medical Center, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['*Alzheimer Disease/classification/epidemiology/genetics/physiopathology', 'Gene-Environment Interaction', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Public Health/*methods', 'Risk Factors']",,,2014/07/16 06:00,2015/07/24 06:00,['2014/07/16 06:00'],"['2014/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['VM00P5L676010635 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-140213 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2014;42(4):1151-63. doi: 10.3233/JAD-140213.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'amyloid', 'dementia', 'epidemiology', 'public heath', 'risk factors', 'social policy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When turning to the prediction of the progression from one stage to another, one could benefit from the joint assessment of imaging-based biomarkers and risk/protective factors. METHODS: We included 86 studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Our review summarizes and discusses the results of 30 years of longitudinal research on brain changes assessed with neuroimaging and the risk/protective factors and their effect on AD progression. We group results into four sections: genetic, demographic, cognitive and cardiovascular, and lifestyle factors. DISCUSSION: Given the complex nature of AD, including risk factors could prove invaluable for a better understanding of AD progression. Some of these risk factors are modifiable and could be targeted by potential future treatments.","[""(c) 2023 The Authors.

By combined biochemical, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural approaches, we demonstrate a link between EAL pathology and the intraneuronal accumulation of the beta-secretase-derived betaAPP fragment (C99) in two in vivo models, 3xTgAD mice and adeno-associated viral-mediated C99-infected mice. We present a pathological loop in which the accumulation of C99 is both the effect and causality of impaired lysosomal-autophagic function. The deleterious effect of C99 was found to be linked to its aggregation within EAL-vesicle membranes leading to disrupted lysosomal proteolysis and autophagic impairment. This effect was Abeta independent and was even exacerbated when gamma-secretase was pharmacologically inhibited. No effect was observed in inhibitor-treated wild-type animals suggesting that lysosomal dysfunction was indeed directly linked to C99 accumulation. In some brain areas, strong C99 expression also led to inflammatory responses and synaptic dysfunction. Taken together, this work demonstrates a toxic effect of C99 which could underlie some of the early-stage anatomical hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease pathology.

After topical application of a cholinergic antagonist (tropicamide) an increased pupillary dilatation response in Alzheimers s disease patients was described (""receptor test""). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of the 0.01% tropicamide receptor test in differentiating types of dementia. METHOD: 425 patients (159 men, 266 women, mean age 75 years) of the Memory Clinic of the SMZ Ost Vienna, Austria were included in the study. 195 patients suffered from a dementia in Alzheimer's disease with late onset (ICD-10: F00.1), 42 from dementia in Alzheimer's disease with early onset (F00.0), 71 from vascular dementia (F01), 34 from Lewy-Body dementia (F03) and 83 from mixed dementia (F00.2). All patients were investigated by means of a computer-assisted pupillometer. The pupillary diameter of the left eye was measured 4 times (baseline=0 minutes, after 20, 40 and 60 minutes). 4 minutes after baseline one drop of 0.01% tropicamide solution was installed onto the left eye of the patients. RESULTS: At baseline the pupillary diameter was largest in Lewy-Body dementia, smallest in vascular dementia. Significant differences were observed between vascular dementia and early-onset dementia in Alzheimer's disease as well as between Lewy-Body dementia and all other dementia syndromes (except dementia in Alzheimer's disease with early onset). The 0.01% tropicamide receptor test made it possible to differentiate early-onset dementia in Alzheimer's disease from vascular and mixed dementia.

On the other hand, the identification of environmental and genetic risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease suggests the involvement of a specific disease process that is not related to normal ageing. The resolution of this fundamental issue is of importance in the design of investigative and therapeutic strategies.

Descriptive analyses revealed that families utilized a range of formal services (eg, adult day) and informal support from family and friends.

Nonetheless, there is no consensus as to what inflammatory mechanisms need to be combated (or facilitated), how therapies for them should be applied, or when they might be efficacious. METHODS: This article seeks to put forward cornerstone facts about neuroinflammation, with suggestions for future directions. RESULTS: Multiple scientific points about neuroinflammation still remain unaddressed. The main issue, however, is political. An expert body is needed that can sort through the myriad findings and provide consensus advice to agencies that fund basic and clinical research. DISCUSSION: Consortium approaches have shown immense value in other Alzheimer's disease research areas and are badly needed in neuroinflammation research.

Previously, we established the scopolamine challenge test (SCT) as a ""cognitive stress test"" screening measure to identify individuals at risk for AD (Alzheimer's & Dementia 10(2):262-7, 2014) (Neurobiol. Aging 36(10):2709-15, 2015). Here we aim to demonstrate the potential of the SCT as an indicator of cognitive change and neocortical amyloid aggregation after a 27-month follow-up interval. METHODS: Older adults (N = 63, aged 55-75 years) with self-reported memory difficulties and first-degree family history of AD completed the SCT and PET amyloid imaging at baseline and were then seen for cognitive testing at 9, 18, and 27 months post-baseline. Repeat PET amyloid imaging was completed at the time of the 27-month exam. RESULTS: Significant differences in both cognitive performance and in Abeta neocortical burden were observed between participants who either failed vs. passed the SCT at baseline, after a 27-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive response to the SCT (Alzheimer's & Dementia 10(2):262-7, 2014) at baseline is related to cognitive change and PET amyloid imaging results, over the course of 27 months, in preclinical AD. The SCT may be a clinically useful screening tool to identify individuals who are more likely to both have positive evidence of amyloidosis on PET imaging and to show measurable cognitive decline over several years.",,"['Alber, Jessica', 'Maruff, Paul', 'Santos, Claudia Y', 'Ott, Brian R', 'Salloway, Stephen P', 'Yoo, Don C', 'Noto, Richard B', 'Thompson, Louisa I', 'Goldfarb, Danielle', 'Arthur, Edmund', 'Song, Alex', 'Snyder, Peter J']","['Alber J', 'Maruff P', 'Santos CY', 'Ott BR', 'Salloway SP', 'Yoo DC', 'Noto RB', 'Thompson LI', 'Goldfarb D', 'Arthur E', 'Song A', 'Snyder PJ']","['Department of Biological & Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Rhode Island, 75 Lower College Road, 2nd Floor, Kingston, RI, USA.', 'Ryan Institute for Neuroscience, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Cogstate Ltd., Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Biological & Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Rhode Island, 75 Lower College Road, 2nd Floor, Kingston, RI, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', ""Banner Alzheimer's Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA."", 'Ryan Institute for Neuroscience, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA.', 'Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Biological & Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Rhode Island, 75 Lower College Road, 2nd Floor, Kingston, RI, USA. pjsnyder@uri.edu.', 'Department of Neurology, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA. pjsnyder@uri.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Alzheimers Res Ther,Alzheimer's research & therapy,101511643,IM,"['Aged', '*Alzheimer Disease/complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides', 'Cognition', '*Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnostic imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Synaptic Transmission']",PMC7093953,,2020/03/27 06:00,2021/06/23 06:00,['2020/03/27 06:00'],"['2019/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13195-020-00599-1 [pii]', '599 [pii]', '10.1186/s13195-020-00599-1 [doi]']",epublish,Alzheimers Res Ther. 2020 Mar 24;12(1):31. doi: 10.1186/s13195-020-00599-1.,['NOTNLM'],"['Alzheimer disease', 'Anticholinergic drugs', 'Beta-amyloid protein', 'Biomarkers', 'Cholinergic', 'Cognition', 'Early detection', 'Early diagnosis', ""Preclinical Alzheimer's disease"", 'Scopolamine']","['P.J.S. is a consultant to Cogstate Ltd., the company that provides the Groton', 'Maze Learning Test.

The increase in prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders such as AD has led to a need for objective means to assist clinicians with the analysis and interpretation of complex biomedical data. To this end, we propose a ""Bioprofile"" analysis to reveal the pattern of disease in the subject's biodata. From the Bioprofile, personal ""Bioindices"" that indicate how closely a subject's data resemble the pattern of AD can be derived. We used an unsupervised technique (k-means) to cluster variables of the ADNI database so that subjects are divisible into those with the Bioprofile of AD and those without it. Results revealed that there is an ""AD pattern"" in the biodata of most AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and some controls. This pattern agrees with a recent hypothetical model of AD evolution. We also assessed how the Bioindices changed with time and we found that the Bioprofile was associated with the risk of progressing from MCI to AD. Hence, the Bioprofile analysis is a promising methodology that may potentially provide a complementary new way of interpreting biomedical data. Furthermore, the concept of the Bioprofile could be extended to other neurodegenerative diseases.",,"['Escudero, Javier', 'Ifeachor, Emmanuel', 'Zajicek, John P']","['Escudero J', 'Ifeachor E', 'Zajicek JP']","['Signal Processing and Multimedia Communications Research Group, School of Computing and Mathematics, Plymouth University, Plymouth, UK. javier.escudero@ieee.org']",['eng'],"['K01 AG030514/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AG010129/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'RP-PG-0707-10124/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'U01 AG024904/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology', '*Cluster Analysis', 'Databases, Factual', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Statistics as Topic/methods']",,,2012/08/14 06:00,2013/08/24 06:00,['2012/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['68444570713W7619 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-2012-121024 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2012;32(4):997-1010. doi: 10.3233/JAD-2012-121024.,,,,,,,"[""Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An ideal antemortem AD biomarker should satisfy the following criteria: the ability to diagnose AD with high sensitivity and specificity as confirmed by the gold standard of autopsy validation; the ability to detect early-stage disease and track the progression of AD; and monitor therapeutic efficacy. AD biomarker technologies currently under development include in vivo brain imaging with PET and MRI (i.e., imaging of amyloid plaques, biochemical assays in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral tissues. CSF biomarkers have received increased attention in the past decade. However, it is unclear whether these biomarkers are capable of early diagnosis of AD, prior to Abeta accumulation, or whether they can differentiate between AD and non-AD dementias. In addition, CSF biomarkers may not lend themselves to diagnostic screening of elderly patients, given the invasiveness of lumbar puncture, inter-laboratory variability in techniques and sample handling, and the circadian fluctuation of CSF components. Although commonly viewed as an abnormality of the brain, AD is a systemic disease with associated dysfunction in metabolic, oxidative, inflammatory, and biochemical pathways in peripheral tissues, such as the skin and blood cells.

Herein, I systematically assess the current level of target validation for PrPC in Alzheimer's disease and the merits of the identified approaches to therapeutically affect the PrPC:Abeta oligomer-interaction. The interaction of Abeta oligomers with PrPC in mice impairs hippocampal long-term potentiation, memory, and learning in a manner that involves Fyn, tau, and glutamate receptors. Furthermore, PrPC acts to catalyze the formation of certain Abeta oligomeric species in the synapse and may mediate the toxic effects of other beta-sheet rich oligomers as well.

D. Roses passed away. Hence, we have taken time to reflect on his work and legacy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Prof. Roses rejected the widely accepted amyloid hypothesis, which identifies amyloid beta (Abeta) protein accumulation within the brain as the cause of AD. Instead, he proposed that the epsilon type 4 allele of apolipoprotein (APOE- E4) and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog (TOMM40) were preeminent factors in the pathogenesis and progression of AD, particularly in late-onset AD (LOAD). This rejection of the amyloid hypothesis has generated new investigations into APOE and TOMM40 as risk factors for AD. Areas covered: We discuss the contributions of Prof. Roses to AD research, describe how APOE-E4 and TOMM40 have been posited to trigger neuropathological changes leading to AD, and explore paths to future clinical applications built on the foundations of his research. Expert opinion: The unconventional methodology of targeting APOE and TOMM40 offers great potential for the development of effective preventive and disease-modifying AD interventions.

Altered metabolism, inflammation, and insulin resistance are key pathological features of both diseases. For many years, it was generally considered that the brain was insensitive to insulin, but it is now accepted that this hormone has central neuromodulatory functions, including roles in learning and memory, that are impaired in AD. However, until recently, the molecular mechanisms accounting for brain insulin resistance in AD have remained elusive. Here, we review recent evidence that sheds light on how brain insulin dysfunction is initiated at a molecular level and why abnormal insulin signaling culminates in synaptic failure and memory decline. We also discuss the cellular basis underlying the beneficial effects of stimulation of brain insulin signaling on cognition.

Vascular disease, which is very common in the elderly, also appears to be a contributor to AD pathogenesis and might be modifiable through pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions to reduce the impact of conditions such as hypertension and metabolic syndrome. Potential disease-modifying approaches that were discussed, including pharmacologic agents that target Abeta, immunotherapy to eliminate plaques in the brain, passive immunotherapy, and secretase inhibitors. Nonpharmacologic approaches included stimulation of endogenous bone marrow cells, which can enter the brain and remove amyloid deposits, and cognitive and exercise training. Innovative trial designs are required that will allow a drug's effectiveness to be determined efficiently in the transition from normal to mild cognitive impairment to probable AD. This might be achieved through the use of various forms of imaging and measurement of biochemical markers in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid, as well as measures that assess very early cognitive and behavioral changes. In the absence of effective treatments for AD, clinicians are faced with a dilemma about why, when, and how to disclose the diagnosis to patients and their family members and/or caregivers. The issues were discussed from multiple perspectives by a panel that included a lay representative, neurologist, psychiatrist, primary care physician, and a psychosocial researcher.",,"['Duara, Ranjan', 'Barker, Warren', 'Loewenstein, David', 'Bain, Lisa']","['Duara R', 'Barker W', 'Loewenstein D', 'Bain L']","[""Wien Center for Alzheimer's Disease & Memory Disorders, Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, FL, USA. duara@msmc.com""]",['eng'],,"['Consensus Development Conference', 'Journal Article']",United States,Alzheimers Dement,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978,IM,"['Aged', 'Alzheimer Disease/pathology/psychology/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Cognition Disorders/pathology/psychology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,,2009/01/03 09:00,2009/02/28 09:00,['2009/01/03 09:00'],"['2008/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]']","['S1552-5260(08)02894-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jalz.2008.10.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Alzheimers Dement. 2009 Jan;5(1):66-74. doi: 10.1016/j.jalz.2008.10.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,15,,,,,,,,,,

LINC00298 RNA, a long intergenic non-coding RNA, has been shown to have preferential expression in the central nervous system where it contributes to neuronal differentiation and development. Furthermore, previous research has indicated that LINC00298 RNA is known to be a genetic risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: To biochemically characterize LINC00298 RNA and to elucidate its biological function within hippocampal neuronal cells, thereby providing a greater understanding of its role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. METHODS: LINC00298 RNA was in vitro transcribed and then subjected to structural analysis using circular dichroism, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Additionally, affinity column chromatography was used to capture LINC00298 RNA's protein binding partners from hippocampal neuronal cells, which were then identified using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS). RESULTS: LINC00298 RNA is comprised of stem-loop secondary structural elements, with a cylindrical tertiary structure that has highly dynamic regions, which result in high positional entropy. LC/MS identified 24 proteins within the interactome of LINC00298 RNA. CONCLUSION: Through analysis of LINC00298 RNA's 24 protein binding partners, it was determined that LINC00298 RNA may play significant roles in neuronal development, proliferation, and cellular organization. Furthermore, analysis of LINC00298 RNA's interactome indicated that LINC00298 RNA is capable of intracellular motility with dual localization in the nucleus and the cytosol. This biochemical characterization of LINC00298 RNA has shed light on its role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.",,"['Kenkpen, Angel K', 'Storey, Joshua J', 'Olson, Emma R', 'Guden, Ty E', 'Card, Tate T', 'Jensen, Ashley S', 'Ahrens, Jordyn L', 'Hellmann Whitaker, Rachel A']","['Kenkpen AK', 'Storey JJ', 'Olson ER', 'Guden TE', 'Card TT', 'Jensen AS', 'Ahrens JL', 'Hellmann Whitaker RA']","['Department of Chemistry, Bemidji State University, Bemidji, MN, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Bemidji State University, Bemidji, MN, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Bemidji State University, Bemidji, MN, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Bemidji State University, Bemidji, MN, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Bemidji State University, Bemidji, MN, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Bemidji State University, Bemidji, MN, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Bemidji State University, Bemidji, MN, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Bemidji State University, Bemidji, MN, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Humans', '*RNA', '*Alzheimer Disease/genetics/metabolism']",,,2023/08/14 06:42,2023/09/19 06:42,['2023/08/14 01:03'],"['2023/09/19 06:42 [medline]', '2023/08/14 06:42 [pubmed]', '2023/08/14 01:03 [entrez]']","['JAD230057 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-230057 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2023;95(2):641-661. doi: 10.3233/JAD-230057.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'genetic risk factors', 'long non-coding RNA', 'transcriptome']",,,,['63231-63-0 (RNA)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We included 107 patients with sporadic AD (21 early onset and 86 late onset) from our memory clinic. Tests for (working) memory, language, executive function, mental speed, and attention were administered. Global atrophy and global and lobar WMH were measured using 1 Tesla MRI. Linear regression analyses with terms for MRI measures, neuropsychological test results, age, gender, education, and the interaction between separate brain measures and age of onset were performed. RESULTS: Global atrophy was associated with more severely impaired global cognition, working memory, mental speed, and executive function (p < 0.05). Significant interactions between global atrophy and age at onset showed that these associations were mostly attributable to patients with early onset AD. By contrast, an association between global atrophy and memory was found, which was specifically attributable to late onset AD patients. No associations between global WMH and cognitive function were found. Subsequently we analyzed regional WMH and found that temporal WMH was associated with impaired memory, and frontal WMH was associated with slower mental speed. CONCLUSION: Cortical atrophy, a key feature of AD, is linked to a wide range of cognitive functions, specifically in early onset AD patients. For WMH, there were no interactions with age at onset, but we found specific associations between temporal WMH and memory and frontal WMH and mental speed.",,"['van der Vlies, Annelies E', 'Staekenborg, Salka S', 'Admiraal-Behloul, Faiza', 'Prins, Niels D', 'Barkhof, Frederik', 'Vrenken, Hugo', 'Reiber, Johan H C', 'Scheltens, Philip', 'van der Flier, Wiesje M']","['van der Vlies AE', 'Staekenborg SS', 'Admiraal-Behloul F', 'Prins ND', 'Barkhof F', 'Vrenken H', 'Reiber JH', 'Scheltens P', 'van der Flier WM']","['Alzheimer Center & Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. ae.vdvlies@vumc.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alzheimer Disease/*diagnosis/metabolism/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neuropsychological Tests']",,,2013/02/01 06:00,2013/12/29 06:00,['2013/02/01 06:00'],"['2013/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['E571531Q15779H22 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-121291 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2013;35(1):169-78. doi: 10.3233/JAD-121291.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review examines a novel therapeutic modality that shows promise for treating AD based on modulating neuronal activity in the gamma frequency band through external brain stimulation. The gamma frequency band is roughly defined as being between 30 Hz-100 Hz, with the 40 Hz point being of particular significance. The epidemiology, diagnostics, existing pathological models, and related current treatment targets are initially briefly reviewed. Next, the concept of external simulation triggering brain activity in the gamma band with potential demonstration of benefit in AD is introduced with reference to a recent important study using a mouse model of the disease. The review then presents a selection of relevant studies that describe the neurophysiology involved in brain stimulation by external sources, followed by studies involving application of the modality to clinical scenarios. A table summarizing the results of clinical studies applied to AD patients is also reported and may aid future development of the modality. The use of a therapy based on modulation of gamma neuronal activity represents a novel non-invasive, non-pharmacological approach to AD. Although use in clinical scenarios is still a relatively recent area of research, the technique shows good signs of efficacy and may represent an important option for treating AD in the future.",,"['McDermott, Barry', 'Porter, Emily', 'Hughes, Diarmaid', 'McGinley, Brian', 'Lang, Mark', ""O'Halloran, Martin"", 'Jones, Marggie']","['McDermott B', 'Porter E', 'Hughes D', 'McGinley B', 'Lang M', ""O'Halloran M"", 'Jones M']","['Translational Medical Device Lab, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Translational Medical Device Lab, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Science, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Translational Medical Device Lab, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Department of Computer Science & Applied Physics, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Galway, Ireland.', 'Centre for Astronomy, School of Physics, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Translational Medical Device Lab, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Translational Medical Device Lab, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,,"['Alzheimer Disease/physiopathology/*prevention & control/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Brain/physiopathology', '*Gamma Rhythm/physiology', 'Humans', '*Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation/methods', '*Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation/methods']",PMC6130417,,2018/07/25 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2018/07/25 06:00'],"['2018/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD180391 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-180391 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2018;65(2):363-392. doi: 10.3233/JAD-180391.,['NOTNLM'],"['40 Hz', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'gamma', 'neural stimulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Participants were selected from the 825 members of the longitudinal BASEL study (BAsel Study on the ELderly), all of whom had been ApoE-genotyped and received comprehensive bi-annual neuropsychological assessments. Within 13 years, 29 were diagnosed with probable AD. Each individual who progressed to AD (AD-P) was pairwise matched to a NC participant based on age, education, demographic status, observation period, and, importantly, ApoE genotype. A regression analysis using the lasso technique identified which of 115 neuropsychological variables best discriminated baseline NC from baseline AD-P performance. This analysis yielded eleven neuropsychological variables that optimally discriminated the two groups (correct classification rate: 60.4%): 1) Intrusions and 2) response bias in verbal learning and memory tasks; 3) delayed figure recall; 4-6) three Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Block Design subtest variables; 7-8) number of errors and repetitions on letter fluency; and 9-11) self-report of memory problems, a feeling of sadness, and cardiac problems.

METHODS: We synthesized the literature on prevalence across the AD continuum and derived a model estimating the number of persons, stratified by 5-year age groups, sex, and disease stage (AD dementia, prodromal AD, and preclinical AD). RESULTS: The global number of persons with AD dementia, prodromal AD, and preclinical AD were estimated at 32, 69, and 315 million, respectively. Together they constituted 416 million across the AD continuum, or 22% of all persons aged 50 and above. DISCUSSION: Considering predementia stages, the number of persons with AD is much larger than conveyed in available literature. Our estimates are uncertain, especially for predementia stages in low- and middle-income regions where biomarker studies are missing.","[""(c) 2022 The Authors.

However, the successful treatment of depressive symptoms in people with AD is rarely seen. In fact, multiple randomized controlled trials have shown selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the current best recommended treatment for depression, to be ineffective in treating depressive symptoms in people with AD. One explanation for this lack of treatment effect may be that depressive symptoms can reflect the progression of AD, rather than clinical depression and are a consequence of more severe neurodegeneration. This raises several questions regarding not only the efficacy of SSRIs in the treatment of depression in people with AD but also regarding the accuracy of diagnosis of depression in AD. However, there may be a rationale for the prescription of SSRIs in early AD. Even in the absence of depression, SSRIs have been shown to slow the conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD. This may be attributed to the effect of SSRIs on the processing of amyloid-beta precursor protein, which may cause a reduction in the accumulation of amyloid-beta. Thus, although SSRIs may lack efficacy in treating depression in people with AD, they may hold therapeutic potential for treating and delaying the progression of AD especially if treatment begins in the early stages of AD.

The demonstration of changes in spatial processing in preceding decades would provide a cognitive marker for pre-clinical AD and an outcome measure for early intervention trials. The present study examined allocentric and egocentric spatial processing in relation to future dementia risk in a middle-aged cohort. The CAIDE Dementia Risk Score (DRS) was calculated for 188 persons aged 40 to 59, of whom 94 had a parent with dementia. Participants underwent the Four Mountains Test (4MT) of allocentric spatial processing, the Virtual Reality Supermarket Trolley Task (VRSTT) of egocentric spatial processing, and 3T MRI scans. A significant negative association was found between the DRS and 4MT (Spearman correlation - 0.26, p = 0.0006), but not with the VRSTT. The 4MT was also found to be a better predictor of risk than tests of episodic memory, verbal fluency, or executive functioning. The results suggest that allocentric rather than egocentric processing may be a potential indicator of risk for late-onset AD, consistent with the hypothesis that the earliest cognitive changes in AD are driven by tau-related degeneration in the medial temporal lobe rather than amyloid-only deposition in the medial parietal lobe.",,"['Ritchie, Karen', 'Carriere, Isabelle', 'Howett, David', 'Su, Li', 'Hornberger, Michael', ""O'Brien, John T"", 'Ritchie, Craig W', 'Chan, Dennis']","['Ritchie K', 'Carriere I', 'Howett D', 'Su L', 'Hornberger M', ""O'Brien JT"", 'Ritchie CW', 'Chan D']","['INSERM, University of Montpellier, Neuropsychiatry: Epidemiological and Clinical Research, Montpellier, France.', 'Centre for Dementia Prevention, University of Edinburgh, UK.', 'INSERM, University of Montpellier, Neuropsychiatry: Epidemiological and Clinical Research, Montpellier, France.', 'Centre for Dementia Prevention, University of Edinburgh, UK.', 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Centre for Dementia Prevention, University of Edinburgh, UK.', 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['MR/M009041/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/M024873/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R380R/1114/DMT_/The Dunhill Medical Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,,"['Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/genetics/*psychology', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Parents', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Concept', '*Space Perception', '*Spatial Navigation']",,,2018/08/15 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2018/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD180432 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-180432 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2018;65(3):885-896. doi: 10.3233/JAD-180432.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'cognition', 'diagnosis', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'neuropsychology', 'preclinical', 'prognosis', 'spatial memory']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We discuss the connection between the apolipoprotein E (APOE) allele and AD, with special consideration to APOE varepsilon4 as the ancestral allele. The phylogeny of AD-like changes across species is also examined, and pathology and treatment implications of AD are discussed from the perspective of evolutionary medicine. In particular, amyloid-beta (Abeta) neuritic plaques and paired helical filament tau (PHFtau) neurofibrillary tangles have been traditionally viewed as injurious pathologies to be targeted, but may be preservative or restorative processes that mitigate harmful neurodegenerative processes or may be epiphenoma of the essential processes that cause neurodegeneration.

Due to different imperfect reference standards, the performance of MoCA and MMSE do not reach consensus. It is necessary to evaluate the consistence and differentiation of MoCA and MMSE in the absence of a gold standard for AD. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the accuracy of MoCA and MMSE in screening AD without a gold standard reference test. METHODS: Studies were identified from PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, Chinese Wanfang Database, China Science and Technology Journal Database, and Cochrane Library. Our search was limited to studies published in English and Chinese before August 2021. A hierarchical Bayesian latent class model was performed in meta-analysis when the gold standard was absent. RESULTS: A total of 67 studies comprising 5,554 individuals evaluated for MoCA and 76,862 for MMSE were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity was 0.934 (95% CI 0.905 to 0.954) for MoCA and 0.883 (95% CI 0.859 to 0.903) for MMSE, while the pooled specificity was 0.899 (95% CI 0.859 to 0.928) for MoCA and 0.903 (95% CI 0.879 to 0.923) for MMSE. MoCA was useful to rule out dementia associated with AD with lower negative likelihood ratio (LR-) (0.074, 95% CI 0.051 to 0.108). MoCA showed better performance with higher diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) (124.903, 95% CI 67.459 to 231.260). CONCLUSION: MoCA had better performance than MMSE in screening dementia associated with AD from patients with mild cognitive impairment or healthy controls.",,"['Wang, Xiaonan', 'Li, Fengjie', 'Gao, Qi', 'Jiang, Zhen', 'Abudusaimaiti, Xiayidanmu', 'Yao, Jiangyue', 'Zhu, Huiping']","['Wang X', 'Li F', 'Gao Q', 'Jiang Z', 'Abudusaimaiti X', 'Yao J', 'Zhu H']","['Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, P.R.

It was based on evidence that oligomers could exist free of amyloid fibrils, that fibril-free oligomer solutions rapidly inhibited long term potentiation, and that oligomers ultimately caused a highly selective nerve cell death. Fibrils no longer were the only toxins made by amyloid-beta (Abeta), and likely not the most important ones. Oligomers provided a new basis for instigating AD. Since introduction of the hypothesis, more than 1,500 articles on oligomers have been published. Articles for this review were selected for contributions to oligomer theory at three different levels. The first set demonstrated new aspects of oligomer pathobiology in cell models, showing that exposure of neurons to oligomers is sufficient to cause key features of AD neuropathology. The second set confirmed the relationship between oligomers and salient AD neuropathology in animal models, consistent with other in vivo studies that overall have substantiated cell-based discoveries. The third set developed strategies for therapeutic targeting of oligomers, introducing both small molecule and antibody-based approaches. These and related findings from many groups have helped establish oligomers as central to the mechanism of AD pathogenesis. Comprising a ligand-based attack on specific synapses, the action of toxic oligomers gives a molecular basis to account for key features of AD neuropathology and to explain why early disease targets memory. Although there still is no effective treatment for AD, insights over the past five years raise hopes that new approaches targeting Abeta oligomers could finally bring disease-modifying therapeutics.",,"['Klein, William L']",['Klein WL'],"[""Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center, Department of Neurobiology, Weinberg College of Arts and Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA. wklein@northwestern.edu""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/drug therapy/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Amyloid/*metabolism', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/*metabolism', 'Brain/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Neurons/*metabolism/pathology', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Synapses/metabolism/pathology']",,,2012/07/13 06:00,2013/06/07 06:00,['2012/07/13 06:00'],"['2012/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['65K4685827164J57 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-2012-129039 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2013;33 Suppl 1:S49-65. doi: 10.3233/JAD-2012-129039.,,,,,,"['0 (Amyloid)', '0 (Amyloid beta-Peptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Care for AD patients poses very significant personal and economic demands on individuals and society, and the situation is expected to get even more dramatic in the coming decades unless effective treatments are found to halt the progression of the disease. Although AD is most commonly regarded as a disease of the memory, the entire brain is eventually affected by neuronal dysfunction or neurodegeneration, which brings about a host of other behavioral disturbances. AD patients often present with apathy, depression, eating and sleeping disorders, aggressive behavior, and other non-cognitive symptoms, which deeply affect not only the patient but also the caregiver's health. These symptoms are usually associated with AD pathology but are often neglected as part of disease progression due to the early and profound impact of disease on memory centers such as the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Yet, a collection of findings offers biochemical insight into mechanisms underlying non-cognitive symptoms in AD, and indicate that, at the molecular level, such symptoms share common mechanisms. Here, we review evidence indicating mechanistic links between memory loss and non-cognitive symptoms of AD.

Indeed, it is a cofactor of many proteins and enzymes in a number of molecular pathways, including energy generation, oxygen transportation, hematopoiesis, cellular growth and metabolism, and signal transduction. This is because it serves as a catalyst of reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions in these processes. When copper is kept under control, bound to special proteins, it yields key properties. However, when it spirals out of control, it is exchanged among small compounds (it is loosely bound to them), and its redox activity makes it dangerous for cell viability, promoting oxidative stress. Copper homeostasis in the CNS is securely synchronized, and perturbations in brain copper levels are known to underlie the pathoetiology of wide spectrum of common neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.

Most studies in the field have been dedicated to evaluating eye-movement behavior during cognitive tasks in different protocols using multiple parameters. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the differences of eye-movement behavior in healthy subjects, subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and those with AD in a simple color task with and without cognitive demand. METHODS: 91 subjects: 18 AD, 47 MCI, and 26 healthy controls had their oculomotor parameters assessed during baseline (no cognitive demand involved) and during a simple computational color memory task using an eye-tracker. RESULTS: Baseline showed statistically different and heterogeneous results between normal cognition and MCI groups.

According to World Health Organization (WHO), AD is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for as many as 60-70% of senile dementia cases and affecting 47.5 million people worldwide (data from 2015) (Dementia Fact Sheet No 362. http://who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs362/en/ ). The median survival time after the onset of dementia ranges from 3.3 to 11.7 years (Todd et al. Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 28:1109-1124, 2013). AD is characterized as a severe, chronic, incurable, and progressive neurodegenerative disorder, associated with memory loss and cognition impairment accompanied by abnormal behavior and personality changes (Godyn et al. Pharmacol Rep 68:127-138, 2016). AD is characterized by neuronal death, which usually correlates with the appearance of key neuropathological changes, including acetylcholine deficiency, glutamate excitotoxicity, extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta plaques), intracellular neurofibrillary tangles by hyperphosphorylated tau protein deposits, neuroinflammation, and widespread neuronal loss (Godyn et al. Pharmacol Rep 68:127-138, 2016; Graham et al. Annu Rev. Med 68:413-430, 2017). The discovery of the degeneration of cholinergic neurons and the reduction of acetylcholine levels in postmortem studies of patients resulted in the use of drugs that leads to the increase of acetylcholine levels in brain (Dubois et al. Lacet Neurol 13:614-629, 2014). At present there is no preventative or curative treatment that interferes with the development of the disease. However, in recent years progress was made in the development of cholinergic drugs which have a positive effect on disease progression. Nowadays, specific drugs that can inhibit the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine are used. The development of new effective drugs involves a difficult and time-consuming process, accompanied by a very high failure rate. In the absence of effective therapies, the estimated number of people with dementia will reach 115 to 131, five million by 2050 (Dubois et al. Lacet Neurol 13:614-629, 2014; Cummings et al. Alzheimers Res Ther 6:37, 2014).

There is an international effort to understand the biology of AD to develop primary and secondary prevention strategies, and to develop effective therapeutic interventions for individuals who are already symptomatic. One of the critically important pieces of all national plans to address AD is the call for the development of service models to deliver quality, effective care based on the best evidence available. METHODS: We describe one type of care model developed by the Fundacio ACE, Institut Catala de Neurociencies Aplicades (Fundacio ACE, Barcelona, Spain) that integrates diagnosis, therapy, follow-up care, daycare, and a day hospital, and does so in the context of an active clinical research and educational program. RESULTS: There were 13,048 individuals newly evaluated and diagnosed in Fundacio ACE between 1996 and 2011. Of these, 6132 had AD (47.0%), 3871 had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (29.7%), and 1958 had no cognitive impairment (15.0%). Follow-up information is available on 4735 (47.3%) AD and MCI patients, and these data indicate that MCI develops into dementia at a rate of 222.6/1000 person-years. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping was available in 22.4% of the patients. The epsilon4 allele occurred in 45.7% of the AD patients, in 37.8% of the MCI subjects, and in 31.6% of those without cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Fundacio ACE can serve as a model system that can be adapted to other settings within their specific cultural, governmental, and legal constraints.","[""Copyright (c) 2014 The Alzheimer's Association.

AD can develop a psychotic manifest at a significant rate. AD prognosis worsens by added psychosis clinic. There is no treatment approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) among antipsychotics for Alzheimer's disease Psychosis (ADP). However, pimavanserine, an atypical antipsychotic, has been approved by the FDA for Parkinson's psychosis. It is predicted that pimavanserin, a new antipsychotic, will fill an important gap in this area. In clinical trials, it appears to be effective in the treatment of delusions and hallucinations at psychosis in both Parkinson's and AD. In this systematic review, we evaluated the analysis of current literature data on pimavanserin used in ADP. We searched the existing literature on clinical studies on pimavanserin therapy used in ADP. Data were determined by systematically searching PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar until December 2022. A total of 35 citations were found and uploaded on the Mendeley program. Abstracts and full texts of literature data were examined. Pimavanserin was observed, and satisfactory results were obtained in treating ADP. Pimavanserin has a unique mechanism of action.

Brain imaging might be one possible predictor of conversion to AD.

Alzheimer's disease is one of the most important neurodegenerative disorders in the developed world together with Parkinson's disease. Although this disease was described almost a century ago, the molecular mechanisms that lead to the development of the neuronal pathology are not clear at the moment. Furthermore, although enormous efforts have been done, an efficient treatment for the disease does not exist yet because the mechanism of neuronal cell death is unknown. In the present work we discuss, in depth, the potential mechanisms involved in apoptosis and neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease. The biology, structure and physiological properties of beta-amyloid peptide and related proteases (secretases) are discussed, as well as existing therapeutics and future strategies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Inhibition of production of amyloid peptides by secretase inhibitors has been suggested as one of the most rational and specific therapeutic approaches. Inhibition of apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress generation and mitochondrial alteration, or blockade of NMDA receptors could constitute suitable therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.

As part of the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia (EPAD) project, a battery of cognitive tests has been proposed (the EPAD Neuropsychological Examination, ENE) which is designed to detect cognitive changes in persons without clinical signs of AD but who are at high risk. Analysis of results from the 361 participants with complete measures and without dementia recruited into the EPAD Longitudinal Cohort Study showed that the majority have elevated biomarker levels, with significant associations between an episodic verbal memory task and tau, while amyloid-beta (Abeta) was associated with a central executive task. These preliminary findings suggest that profiles of cognitive performance may be specific to a given biomarker, with a primarily hippocampal task being associated with higher levels of tau and a frontal executive task being associated with higher levels of Abeta.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term efficacy of galantamine treatment in a Japanese population. METHODS: We performed ""Okayama Galantamine Study (OGS)"" to retrospectively analyze the clinical effects of galantamine in 279 AD patients using 7 batteries for assessing dementia at baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. We further analyzed the effects of galantamine based on gender and the severity of their baseline cognitive, affective, and activity of daily living (ADL) functions. RESULTS: In all 279 AD patients (80.6 +/- 7.2 years old, MMSE 20.0 +/- 4.5), cognitive functions were well preserved until 12 months and even frontal assessment battery improved after 12 months although Hasegawa dementia scale-revised finally worsened at 24 months ( *p <  0.05) with galantamine treatment. Affective and ADL functions were also well maintained after galantamine treatment with significant improvement of Geriatric Depression Scale scores at 3 months ( *p <  0.05). Subanalyses showed the better response to galantamine for male and lower baseline function subgroups.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare 1-year and all-available lookback approaches to ascertaining ADRD compared to the standard 3-year approach. Using a cohort of Veterans hospitalized for heart failure (N = 373, 897), our results suggested high agreement (93% or greater) between the lookback periods.

However, the extent and time course of alterations in the gut microbiota, and their effects on AD pathology remain uncertain. Herein, we compared the fecal microbiomes and fecal short chain fatty acid composition (SCFAs) between wild-type and AD model mice at different ages under strictly controlled specific pathogen free conditions, and also conducted microscopic investigations of intestinal structures. Our results showed that the microbiota composition and diversity were perturbed and the level of SCFAs was reduced in AD mice, predicting alterations in more than 30 metabolic pathways, which may be associated with amyloid deposition and ultrastructural abnormalities in AD mouse intestine. These findings indicate that AD pathology might not only affect brain function directly, but also exacerbate cognitive deficits through reducing the level of SCFAs via alterations of gut microbiota induced by intestinal amyloid deposition.

OBJECTIVES: Compare all-cause mortality, rate of institutionalization, and economic burden between treated and untreated newly-diagnosed AD patients. METHODS: Patients aged 65-100 years with >/=1 primary or >/=2 secondary AD diagnoses (ICD-9-CM:331.0] with continuous medical and pharmacy benefits for >/=12 months pre-index and >/=6 months post-index date (first AD diagnosis date) were identified from Medicare fee-for-service claims 01JAN2011-30JUN2014. Patients with AD treatment claims or AD/AD-related dementia diagnosis during the pre-index period were excluded. Patients were assigned to treated and untreated cohorts based on AD treatment received post-index date. Total 8,995 newly-diagnosed AD patients were identified; 4,037 (44.8%) were assigned to the treated cohort. Time-to-death and institutionalization were assessed using Cox regression. To compare health care costs and utilizations, 1 : 1 propensity score matching (PSM) was used. RESULTS: Untreated patients were older (83.85 versus 81.44 years; p < 0.0001), with more severe comorbidities (mean Charlson comorbidity index: 3.54 versus 3.22; p < 0.0001). After covariate adjustment, treated patients were less likely to die (hazard ratio[HR] = 0.69; p < 0.0001) and were associated with 20% lower risk of institutionalization (HR = 0.801; p = 0.0003). After PSM, treated AD patients were less likely to have hospice visits (3.25% versus 9.45%; p < 0.0001), and incurred lower annual all-cause costs ($25,828 versus $30,110; p = 0.0162). CONCLUSION: After controlling for comorbidities, treated AD patients have better survival, lower institutionalization, and sometimes fewer resource utilizations, suggesting that treatment and improved care management could be beneficial for newly-diagnosed AD patients from economic and clinical perspectives.",,"['Black, Christopher M', 'Fillit, Howard', 'Xie, Lin', 'Hu, Xiaohan', 'Kariburyo, M Furaha', 'Ambegaonkar, Baishali M', 'Baser, Onur', 'Yuce, Huseyin', 'Khandker, Rezaul K']","['Black CM', 'Fillit H', 'Xie L', 'Hu X', 'Kariburyo MF', 'Ambegaonkar BM', 'Baser O', 'Yuce H', 'Khandker RK']","['Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.', ""The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, New York, NY, USA."", 'STATinMED Research, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'STATinMED Research, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Center for Innovation and Outcomes Research, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'STATinMED Research, New York, NY, USA.', 'New York City College of Technology (CUNY), New York, NY, USA.', 'Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/economics/epidemiology/mortality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', '*Cost of Illness', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Institutionalization/*methods', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests']",,,2017/11/06 06:00,2018/07/14 06:00,['2017/11/06 06:00'],"['2017/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD170518 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-170518 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2018;61(1):185-193. doi: 10.3233/JAD-170518.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Medicare', 'institutionalization', 'mortality']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lack of clinical efficacy for the highly specific and potent AChE inhibitor, (-) huperzine A, is intriguing, given the known cholinergic deficit in AD. Based on the proven efficacy of inhibitors affecting both cholinesterases and the apparent failure of specific AChE inhibition, focused BuChE inhibition seems important for more effective treatment of AD.

The long preclinical phase is composed of three stages according to the 2011National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria, followed by mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a featured clinical entity defined as ""due to AD"", or ""prodromal AD"", when pathophysiological biomarkers (i.e., cerebrospinal fluid or positron emission tomography with amyloid tracer) are positive. In the clinical setting, there is a clear need to detect the earliest symptoms not yet fulfilling MCI criteria, in order to proceed to biomarker assessment for diagnostic definition, thus offering treatment with disease-modifying drugs to patients as early as possible. According to the available evidence, we thus estimated the prevalence and risk of progression at each preclinical AD stage, with special interest in Stage 3. METHODS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies published from April 2008 to May 2018 were obtained through MEDLINE-PubMed, screened, and systematically reviewed by four independent reviewers. Data from included studies were meta-analyzed using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed by I(2) statistics. RESULTS: Estimated overall prevalence of preclinical AD was 22% (95% CI = 18-26%). Rate of biomarker positivity overlapped in cognitively normal individuals and people with subjective cognitive decline. The risk of progression increases across preclinical AD stages, with individuals classified as NIA-AA Stage 3 showing the highest risk (73%, 95% CI = 40-92%) compared to those in Stage 2 (38%, 95% CI = 21-59%) and Stage 1 (20%, 95% CI = 10-34%). CONCLUSION: Available data consistently show that risk of progression increases across the preclinical AD stages, where Stage 3 shows a risk of progression comparable to MCI due to AD. Accordingly, an effort should be made to also operationalize the diagnostic work-up in subjects with subtle cognitive deficits not yet fulfilling MCI criteria. The possibility to define, in the clinical routine, a patient as ""pre-MCI due to AD"" could offer these subjects the opportunity to use disease-modifying drugs at best.",,"['Parnetti, Lucilla', 'Chipi, Elena', 'Salvadori, Nicola', ""D'Andrea, Katia"", 'Eusebi, Paolo']","['Parnetti L', 'Chipi E', 'Salvadori N', ""D'Andrea K"", 'Eusebi P']","['Centre for Memory Disturbances, Lab of Clinical Neurochemistry, Section of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy. lucilla.parnetti@unipg.it.', 'Centre for Memory Disturbances, Lab of Clinical Neurochemistry, Section of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Centre for Memory Disturbances, Lab of Clinical Neurochemistry, Section of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Centre for Memory Disturbances, Lab of Clinical Neurochemistry, Section of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Centre for Memory Disturbances, Lab of Clinical Neurochemistry, Section of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",England,Alzheimers Res Ther,Alzheimer's research & therapy,101511643,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Prevalence', '*Prodromal Symptoms', 'Risk Factors']",PMC6334406,,2019/01/17 06:00,2020/03/31 06:00,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2018/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13195-018-0459-7 [pii]', '459 [pii]', '10.1186/s13195-018-0459-7 [doi]']",epublish,Alzheimers Res Ther. 2019 Jan 15;11(1):7. doi: 10.1186/s13195-018-0459-7.,['NOTNLM'],"['Biomarkers', ""National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association criteria"", ""Preclinical Alzheimer's disease"", 'Prevalence', 'Systematic review']","['ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Not applicable.

We included 121 AD patients with delusions (AD-D) and 259 AD patients without delusions (AD-noD). AD-D patients were significantly older, with higher age at onset and cognitive impairment, a more severe stage of dementia, and more depressive symptoms than AD-noD patients. Disease duration was slightly higher in AD-D patients than in those without delusions, although this difference was not statistically significant. At CGA, AD-D patients showed a higher grade of disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and an increased risk of malnutrition and bedsores. The two groups of patients significantly differed in MPI score (AD-D: 0.65 versus AD-noD: 0.51, p <  0.0001) and MPI grade. AD-D patients showed also a significant higher score in NPI of the following NPS than AD-noD patients: hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression mood, apathy, irritability/lability, aberrant motor activity, sleep disturbances, and eating disorders. Therefore, AD-D patients showed higher dementia severity, and higher impairment in cognitive and depressive symptoms, and several neuropsychiatric domains than AD-noD patients, and this appeared to be associated with higher multidimensional impairment and increased risk of mortality.",,"[""D'Onofrio, Grazia"", 'Panza, Francesco', 'Sancarlo, Daniele', 'Paris, Francesco F', 'Cascavilla, Leandro', 'Mangiacotti, Antonio', 'Lauriola, Michele', 'Paroni, Giulia H', 'Seripa, Davide', 'Greco, Antonio']","[""D'Onofrio G"", 'Panza F', 'Sancarlo D', 'Paris FF', 'Cascavilla L', 'Mangiacotti A', 'Lauriola M', 'Paroni GH', 'Seripa D', 'Greco A']","['Geriatric Unit & Laboratory of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Department of Medical Sciences, IRCCS ""Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"", San Giovanni Rotondo, Foggia, Italy.', 'Geriatric Unit & Laboratory of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Department of Medical Sciences, IRCCS ""Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"", San Giovanni Rotondo, Foggia, Italy.', 'Neurodegenerative Disease Unit, Department of Basic Medicine, Neuroscience, and Sense Organs, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.', 'Geriatric Unit & Laboratory of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Department of Medical Sciences, IRCCS ""Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"", San Giovanni Rotondo, Foggia, Italy.', 'Geriatric Unit & Laboratory of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Department of Medical Sciences, IRCCS ""Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"", San Giovanni Rotondo, Foggia, Italy.', 'Geriatric Unit & Laboratory of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Department of Medical Sciences, IRCCS ""Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"", San Giovanni Rotondo, Foggia, Italy.', 'Geriatric Unit & Laboratory of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Department of Medical Sciences, IRCCS ""Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"", San Giovanni Rotondo, Foggia, Italy.', 'Geriatric Unit & Laboratory of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Department of Medical Sciences, IRCCS ""Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"", San Giovanni Rotondo, Foggia, Italy.', 'Geriatric Unit & Laboratory of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Department of Medical Sciences, IRCCS ""Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"", San Giovanni Rotondo, Foggia, Italy.', 'Geriatric Unit & Laboratory of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Department of Medical Sciences, IRCCS ""Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"", San Giovanni Rotondo, Foggia, Italy.', 'Geriatric Unit & Laboratory of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Department of Medical Sciences, IRCCS ""Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"", San Giovanni Rotondo, Foggia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alzheimer Disease/*complications/diagnosis/mortality/*psychology', 'Delusions/diagnosis/*etiology/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Status Schedule', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Time Factors']",,,2016/02/19 06:00,2016/12/21 06:00,['2016/02/19 06:00'],"['2016/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JAD150944 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-150944 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2016;51(2):427-37. doi: 10.3233/JAD-150944.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Multidimensional Prognostic Index', 'comprehensive geriatric assessment', 'delusions', 'depressive symptoms', 'functional status', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric symptoms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As life expectancy increases and demographic ageing occurs, the global prevalence of Alzheimer's disease is expected to continue to rise especially in developing countries, leading to a costly burden of disease. Alzheimer's disease is a complex and multifactorial disorder that is determined by the interaction of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors across the life course. Epidemiological studies have identified potential modifiable risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease prevention. Moreover, Alzheimer's disease is considered to start decades earlier before clinical symptoms occur, thus interventions targeting several risk factors in non-demented elderly people even middle-aged population might prevent or delay Alzheimer's disease onset.

METHODS: We compared the validity of the 2-year change (Y0-Y2) of 11 markers of neuropsychological and functional abilities for the prediction of incident dementia over the following 3 years (Y2-Y5), in 860 subjects aged 70 years or older, who consulted for memory loss and were included in the ""GuidAge"" prevention trial. RESULTS: The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test-Free Recall (FCSRT-FR) score showed the most predictive 2-year change (area under the curve = 0.72 95% confidence interval = 0.64;0.81). Changes in other subscores of the FCSRT, verbal fluencies tasks, and composite cognitive score were also significantly predictive. Conversely, 2-year change of Mini-Mental State Examination, Trail Making test (TMT)-A, TMT-B, Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scores did not significantly predict occurrence of dementia. CONCLUSION: The FCSRT, the Fluency Task, and the composite cognitive score appear to be good cognitive markers of progression toward dementia in early prevention trials.","[""(c) 2021 the Alzheimer's Association.""]","['Mura, Thibault', 'Coley, Nicola', 'Amieva, Helene', 'Berr, Claudine', 'Gabelle, Audrey', 'Ousset, Pierre-Jean', 'Vellas, Bruno', 'Andrieu, Sandrine']","['Mura T', 'Coley N', 'Amieva H', 'Berr C', 'Gabelle A', 'Ousset PJ', 'Vellas B', 'Andrieu S']","['INSERM-University of Toulouse, UMR1027, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, CHU Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Clinical Epidemiology, Public Health and Innovation in Methodology (BESPIM), CHU Nimes, University of Montpellier, Nimes, France.', 'INSERM-University of Toulouse, UMR1027, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, CHU Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Inserm U1219 Bordeaux Population Health Center, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM-University of Montpellier, U1061, Montpellier, France.', 'Memory Resources and Research Center, Department of Neurology, Gui de Chauliac University Hospital, Montpellier, France.', 'INSERM-University of Montpellier, U1061, Montpellier, France.', 'Memory Resources and Research Center, Department of Neurology, Gui de Chauliac University Hospital, Montpellier, France.', 'INSERM-University of Toulouse, UMR1027, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, CHU Toulouse, Gerontopole, Toulouse, France.', 'INSERM-University of Toulouse, UMR1027, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, CHU Toulouse, Gerontopole, Toulouse, France.', 'INSERM-University of Toulouse, UMR1027, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, CHU Toulouse, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Alzheimers Dement,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', '*Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/prevention & control/psychology', '*Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnosis/prevention & control/psychology', 'Humans', 'Mental Status and Dementia Tests', 'Neuropsychological Tests']",,,2021/09/06 06:00,2022/04/09 06:00,['2021/09/05 21:07'],"['2021/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/05 21:07 [entrez]']",['10.1002/alz.12431 [doi]'],ppublish,Alzheimers Dement. 2022 Apr;18(4):676-687. doi: 10.1002/alz.12431.

A neural network and a voting strategy were used for classification. Here, we consider instead the statistical distribution functions of their latencies and amplitudes and suggest that the 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test based upon their latency distribution functions offers an alternative biomarker for AD, with their amplitude distribution at the frontal electrode fp2 as possibly another.

Given the early involvement of this pathological process, it is not surprising that many clinically normal (CN) older individuals demonstrate evidence of abnormal Abeta at postmortem examination and in vivo using either CSF or PET imaging. Converging evidence across multiple research groups suggests that the presence of abnormal Abeta among CN individuals is associated with elevated risk of future clinical impairment and cognitive decline. Amyloid positivity in conjunction with biomarkers of neuronal injury offers further insight into which CN are most at risk for short-term decline. Although in its infancy, tau PET has demonstrated early increases among Abeta+ that will likely be an important indicator of risk among CN. Overall, the detection of early Abeta among CN individuals has provided an important opportunity to understand the contributions of this pathology to age-related cognitive decline and to explore early intervention with disease modifying strategies.",,"['Mormino, Elizabeth C', 'Papp, Kathryn V']","['Mormino EC', 'Papp KV']","['Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', ""Department of Neurology, Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],['K01 AG051718/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aging/genetics/*metabolism/*psychology', 'Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Amyloid/*metabolism', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnostic imaging/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans']",PMC6387885,['NIHMS1012772'],2018/05/22 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/05/22 06:00'],"['2018/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD179928 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-179928 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2018;64(s1):S633-S646. doi: 10.3233/JAD-179928.,['NOTNLM'],"['Aging', 'PET', 'amyloid', 'biomarkers', 'cognitive decline', 'early detection', 'memory']",,,,['0 (Amyloid)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The actual cause and cascade of events in the progression of this pathology is not fully determined. AD is multifaceted in nature and is linked to different multiple mechanisms in the brain. This aspect is related to the lack of efficacious therapies that could slow down or hinder the disease onset/progression. The ideal treatment for AD should be able to modulate the disease through multiple mechanisms rather than targeting a single dysregulated pathway. Recently, the endocannabinoid system emerged as a novel potential therapeutic target to treat AD. In fact, exogenous and endogenous cannabinoids seem to be able to modulate multiple processes in AD, although the mechanisms that are involved are not fully elucidated. This review provides an update of this area. In this review, we recapitulate the role of endocannabinoid signaling in AD and the probable mechanisms through which modulators of the endocannabinoid system provide their effects, thus highlighting how this target might provide more advantages over other therapeutic targets.",,"['Bedse, Gaurav', 'Romano, Adele', 'Lavecchia, Angelo M', 'Cassano, Tommaso', 'Gaetani, Silvana']","['Bedse G', 'Romano A', 'Lavecchia AM', 'Cassano T', 'Gaetani S']","['Department of Biochemical Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy Department of Physiology and Pharmacology ""V.

Although other major causes of death have been on the decrease, deaths because of AD have been rising dramatically. Between 2000 and 2008 (preliminary data), heart disease deaths decreased by 13%, stroke deaths by 20%, and prostate cancer-related deaths by 8%, whereas deaths because of AD increased by 66%. An estimated 5.4 million Americans have AD; approximately 200,000 people aged <65 years with AD comprise the younger-onset AD population. Every 69 seconds, someone in America develops AD; by 2050, the time is expected to accelerate to every 33 seconds. Over the coming decades, the baby boom population is projected to add 10 million people to these numbers. In 2050, the incidence of AD is expected to approach nearly a million people per year, with a total estimated prevalence of 11 to 16 million people. Dramatic increases in the numbers of ""oldest-old"" (those aged >/=85 years) across all racial and ethnic groups will also significantly affect the numbers of people living with AD. In 2010, nearly 15 million family and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 17 billion hours of care to people with AD and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $202 billion. Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries aged >/=65 years with AD and other dementias are almost 3 times higher than for beneficiaries without these conditions. Total payments in 2011 for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people aged >/=65years with AD and other dementias are expected to be $183 billion (not including the contributions of unpaid caregivers). This report provides information to increase understanding of the public health effect of AD, including incidence and prevalence, mortality, health expenditures and costs of care, and effect on caregivers and society in general. The report also examines the current state of AD detection and diagnosis, focusing on the benefits of early detection and the factors that present challenges to accurate diagnosis.","[""Copyright (c) 2011 The Alzheimer's Association.

The beneficial effects of non-drug treatments are poorly studied. OBJECTIVE: To describe the effects of an Integrated Psychostimulation Program (IPP) in patients with mild-moderate AD treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; and to identify factors related to greater benefit of the IPP. METHODS: 206 patients (mean age = 75.9 years; MMSE = 19.6) were evaluated before starting the IPP and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months later. Measures included: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cognitive Subscale of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), Rapid Disability Rating Scale (RDRS-2), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). RESULTS: Patients remained cognitively stable (MMSE/ADAS-Cog) for more than 6 months and significantly worsened at 9-month and 12-month follow-ups, without clinically significant functional changes (RDRS-2) or psychiatric symptoms(NPI-Q). The mean annual change on MMSE and ADAS-Cog were 2.06 and 3.56 points, respectively, lower than the annual decline demonstrated previously in similar patients (2.4 and 4.5, respectively). 42.7% of patients maintained or improved global cognitive scores between baseline and 12-month follow-up.

Neuroprotective and neurorestorative interventions are disease-modifying therapies. Disease modification can be defined as treatments or interventions that affect the underlying pathophysiology of the disease and have a beneficial outcome on the course of AD. In a clinical trial the criteria for affecting the underlying cause of the disease can be supported by demonstrating an effect on a biomarker such as medial temporal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or diminished tau or phospho-tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid. The claim for a beneficial effect on the clinical course of AD is supported by a drug-placebo difference on the primary clinical outcomes of the clinical trial. A statistically significant correlation between the biomarker outcome and the clinical trial outcome would support the claim that these are based on the same underlying mechanism. Delayed start or staggered withdrawal designs might in themselves support a disease-modifying claim but are difficult to implement. A combination of clinical outcomes and biomarker measures is a more likely pathway to a disease-modifying claim. Labeling of disease-modifying agents might refer to slowing of disease progression, delay in reaching predefined disease milestones, or reduction in progression of a biomarker such as cerebral atrophy or ventricular enlargement on MRI.

The amyloid core of the neuritic plaques found in the brains of individuals with the disease has been shown to be composed of a distinct peptide formed through proteolytic degradation of a large precursor protein, the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP), which exists in at least three isoforms differing from each other in the splicing of the primary transcript from which they derive. Although the physiological function of APP remains unknown, it has been suggested to function as a protease inhibitor and to be important to the blood coagulation system. The gene encoding APP is located on the long arm of chromosome 21. Individuals with Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) often develop AD in early middle age, suggesting that the 50 percent increase in APP, gene expression may promote the development of the disease. Mutations in the APP gene have also been shown to be associated, probably pathogenetically with familial forms of AD.

Although no disease-modifying treatments are currently available for AD, earlier diagnosis and proper management of the disease could have considerable impact on patient and caregiver quality of life and functioning. Drugs currently approved for AD treat the cognitive, behavioral, and functional symptoms of the disease and consist of three cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine. Treatment of patients with mild to moderate AD is generally initiated with a ChEI. Patients who show progression of symptoms while on ChEI monotherapy may be switched to another ChEI and/or memantine can be added to the treatment regimen. In recent years, putative disease-modifying therapies have emerged that aim to slow the progression of AD instead of only addressing its symptoms.

However, there are mixed findings as to how the APOE4 allele modifies the effects of both higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and statin use on cognitive functioning. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to examine the effects of LDL levels and statin use on verbal learning and memory, as modified by the presence of the APOE4 allele, in a sample of cognitively unimpaired, older adults at risk for AD. METHODS: Neuropsychological, LDL, statin use, and APOE4 data were extracted from an ongoing longitudinal study at the Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Arizona. Participants were cognitively unimpaired based on Mini-Mental State Examination scores within a normal range, aged 47-75, with a family history of probable AD in at least one first-degree relative. RESULTS: In the whole sample, higher LDL was associated with worse immediate verbal memory in APOE4 non-carriers, but did not have an effect on immediate verbal memory in APOE4 carriers. In APOE4 non-carriers, statin use was associated with better verbal learning, but did not have an effect on verbal learning in APOE4 carriers.

The drugs introduced for this disease have many side effects and limitations in use, so the production of a suitable herbal medicine to cure AD patients is essential. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research is to make a magnetic neuropeptide nano shuttle as a targeted carrier for the transfer of quercetin to the brains of AD model rats. METHODS: In this work, a magnetic quercetin-neuropeptide nanocomposite (MQNPN) was fabricated and administered to the rat's brain by the shuttle drug of the Margatoxin scorpion venom neuropeptide, and will be a prospect for targeted drug delivery in AD. The MQNPN has been characterized by FTIR, spectroscopy, FE-SEM, XRD, and VSM. Investigations into the efficacy of MQNPN, MTT, and real Time PCR for MAPT and APP genes expression were performed. After 7 days treatment with Fe3O4 (Ctr) and MQNPN treatment in AD rat, superoxide dismutase activity and quercetin in blood serum and brain was detected. Hematoxylin-Eosin staining was applied for histopathological analysis. RESULTS: Analysis of data showed that MQNPN increased the activity of superoxide dismutase. The histopathology results of the hippocampal region of AD rats also confirmed their improvement after treatment with MQNPN. MQNPN treatment caused a significant decrease in the relative expression of MAPT and APP genes. CONCLUSION: MQNPN is a suitable carrier for the transfer of quercetin to the rat hippocampus, and has a significant effect in reducing AD symptoms in terms of histopathology, behavioral testing, and changing the expression of AD-related genes.",,"['Mobasheri, Kamelia', 'Zaefizadeh, Mohammad', 'Ghobeh, Maryam', 'Eidi, Akram']","['Mobasheri K', 'Zaefizadeh M', 'Ghobeh M', 'Eidi A']","['Department of Biology, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Traditional Medicine and Hydrotherapy Research Center, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Ardabil Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ardabil, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Rats', 'Animals', '*Alzheimer Disease/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Quercetin/therapeutic use', '*Neuropeptides', 'Superoxide Dismutase/genetics', '*Nanoparticles/therapeutic use', 'Magnetic Phenomena', 'Disease Models, Animal']",,,2023/07/02 06:41,2023/08/08 06:42,['2023/07/02 04:33'],"['2023/08/08 06:42 [medline]', '2023/07/02 06:41 [pubmed]', '2023/07/02 04:33 [entrez]']","['JAD221095 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-221095 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2023;94(3):1145-1155. doi: 10.3233/JAD-221095.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'nano-drug shuttle system', 'nanocomposite', 'neuropeptide', 'quercetin']",,,,"['9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, evidence for using antihypertensive agents to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease in people with hypertension is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between antihypertensive agents and the incidence of Alzheimer's disease in adults with hypertension and normal cognition. DESIGN: We conducted a systemic review and performed meta-analyses using Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid PsycINFO, Web of science and Scopus, from inception to 18th February 2022. SETTING: Cohort and case-control studies. PARTICIPANTS: Adults >/= 40 years with hypertension and normal cognition. INTERVENTION: Antihypertensive agents. MEASUREMENTS: We performed two separate meta-analyses, pooling the adjusted relative risk (RR) of non-antihypertensive comparator and antihypertensive comparator study design. RESULTS: We included nine studies, totalling 1,527,410 individuals. Meta-analysis of non-antihypertensive user comparator studies found that the use of antihypertensive agents is associated with a reduced risk of incident Alzheimer's disease (RR= 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.99; p=0.01). Meta-analysis of antihypertensive comparator studies found evidence that angiotensin II receptor blocker users are associated with a reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's disease compared to other antihypertensive agents (RR= 0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.88; p< 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our review provides evidence that the use of antihypertensive agents is associated with a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease. The use of angiotensin II receptor blockers may provide the most benefit among antihypertensive agents.

In particular, HPA disturbances have been associated with memory impairments, and hypercortisolemic conditions with atrophy of the hippocampus, a limbic structure closely associated with declarative memory. Recent discoveries support a more complicated picture of HPA axis function and pathology in acquiring, retrieving, and consolidating new memories. These findings include: the existence of an 'inverted U-shaped relationship"" between stimulation of brain glucocorticoid receptors and memory performance; that distinct areas of the hippocampus have been found to respond differently to cortisol stimulation; and that hippocampal atrophy has been found to be potentially reversible in some conditions, although whether such atrophy is a cause or effect of these pathological conditions is currently unclear. More longitudinal studies of HPA axis function in aging normal individuals, those with mild cognitive impairment,and individuals with Alzheimer' disease, examining pertinent variables such as APOEe-4 status, are needed to help clarify these new findings. Antiglucocorticoid agents appear to have therapeutic value in particular conditions. These results are relevant for understanding and treating memory dysfunction in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, a disorder prominently and invariably characterized by early hippocampal lesions and memory impairment.

Increasing evidence supports a role of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta)-induced oxidative stress in the progression and pathogenesis of AD. In this review, we summarize evidence for a role of oxidative stress in the progression of AD by comparing the appearance of the same oxidized brain proteins from subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), early AD (EAD), and late-stage AD, and relating these findings to the reported AD pathology. The identification of oxidized brain proteins in common in MCI, EAD, and AD brain suggest that certain key pathways are triggered and may be involved in the progression of AD.

First Evidence from Spinal Stimulation Efficacy on Executive Functions.,1755-1764,10.3233/JAD-200695 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Recently, a growing body of evidence has shown that, from the early stage of impairment, Alzheimer's patients (AD) present difficulties on a variety of tasks mostly relying on executive functions. These strongly impact their daily life activities causing a severe loss of independency and autonomy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of transpinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) combined with cognitive trainings for improving attentional and executive function abilities in a group of AD patients. METHODS: In a randomized-double blind design, sixteen AD patients underwent different cognitive trainings combined with tsDCS. During the treatment, each subject received tsDCS (20 min, 2 mA) over the thoracic vertebrae (IX-X vertebrae) in two different conditions: 1) anodal, and 2) sham while performing three computerized tasks: alertness, selective attention, and executive functions. Each experimental condition was run in ten consecutive daily sessions over two weeks. RESULTS: After anodal tsDCS, a greater improvement in executive functions compared to sham condition was found. More importantly, the follow-up testing revealed that these effects lasted over 1 month after the intervention and generalized to the different neuropsychological tests administered before, after the treatment and at one month after the end of the intervention. This generalization was present also in the attentional domain. CONCLUSION: This evidence emphasizes, for the first time, that tsDCS combined with cognitive training results efficacious for AD patients. We hypothesize that enhancing activity into the spinal sensorimotor pathways through stimulation improved cognitive abilities which rely on premotor activity, such as attention and executive functions.",,"['Pisano, Francesca', 'Caltagirone, Carlo', 'Satriano, Federica', 'Perri, Roberta', 'Fadda, Lucia', 'Marangolo, Paola']","['Pisano F', 'Caltagirone C', 'Satriano F', 'Perri R', 'Fadda L', 'Marangolo P']","['Department of Humanities studies - University Federico II, Naples, Italy.', 'IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Humanities studies - University Federico II, Naples, Italy.', 'IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/*psychology/*therapy', 'Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/*methods', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Executive Function/*physiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Spinal Cord Stimulation/*methods/*psychology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2020/09/15 06:00,2021/09/11 06:00,['2020/09/14 15:42'],"['2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/14 15:42 [entrez]']","['JAD200695 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-200695 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2020;77(4):1755-1764. doi: 10.3233/JAD-200695.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'cognitive training', 'neuromodulation', 'transpinal stimulation', 'tsDCS']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the magnitude of AD's impact on patients, caregivers, and society, nearly all AD clinical trials fail. A potential contributor to this high rate of failure is that established clinical outcome assessments fail to capture subtle clinical changes, entail high burden for patients and their caregivers, and ineffectively address the aspects of health deemed important by patients and their caregivers. AD progression is associated with widespread changes in physical behavior that have impacts on the ability to function independently, which is a meaningful aspect of health for patients with AD and important for diagnosis. However, established assessments of functional independence remain underutilized in AD clinical trials and are limited by subjective biases and ceiling effects. Digital measures of real-world physical behavior assessed passively, continuously, and remotely using digital health technologies have the potential to address some of these limitations and to capture aspects of functional independence in patients with AD. In particular, measures of real-world gait, physical activity, and life-space mobility captured with wearable sensors may offer value.

Neuroimaging studies have reported VRFs for AD to be accurate predictors of cognitive decline and dementia. In regions that participate in higher cognitive function, middle temporal, posterior cingulate, inferior parietal and precuneus regions, and neuroimaging studies indicate an association involving VRFs, cerebral hypoperfusion, and cognitive decline in elderly individuals who develop AD. The VRF can be present in cognitively intact individuals for decades before mild cognitive deficits or neuropathological signs are manifested. In that sense, they may be ""ticking time bombs"" before cognitive function is demolished. Preventive intervention of modifiable VRF may delay or block progression of AD.

In fact, we believe that these phenomena represent natural compensatory mechanisms for impaired primary neurodegeneration, membrane dynamic deterioration, and/or associated failures of neurotransmission, synaptic function, and neuroplasticity. Physiologically, Abeta, lipid peroxidation, and tau protein may function to sense changes in activity-dependent membrane properties and therefore biochemically modulate membrane lipid homeostasis for more efficient synaptic action. As such, the previously proposed therapeutic tackling of amyloid, tau, oxidative stress, and other brain disease markers may have no ability to cure AD or other devastating central nervous system pathologies and peripheral nervous system diseases.

This paper highlights five major recent contributions of the French Three-City (3C) and PAQUID epidemiological studies to Alzheimer's disease (AD) knowledge, targeting genetic and dietary risk factors, and the impact of cognitive decline in daily living. The 3C study contributed to a large genome-wide association study to identify new genetic risk factors for AD. In addition to apolipoprotein E (APOE), two loci gave replicated evidence of association: one within CLU, encoding clusterin or apolipoprotein J, and the other within CR1, encoding the complement component receptor 1. Although the attributable fraction of risk for these polymorphisms is moderate, genetic studies provide significant insights into the molecular bases of AD. Regarding dietary data, findings from 3C suggest that healthy diets associating sources of both omega 3 fatty acids (fish) and antioxidants (fruits and vegetables) such as the Mediterranean diet, and caffeine could be associated with decreased risk for AD. However, the protective effect of omega3 fatty acids might be limited to APOE4 non-carriers. Future research should focus on gene-nutrient interactions. Regarding the functional impact of prodromal AD, the PAQUID study showed that taking into account mild functional limitations considerably increases the predictive value of neuropsychological tests for conversion to dementia. Research should focus on sensitive instruments to capture early functional decline to improve the identification of elderly patients at high risk of conversion to dementia.",,"['Barberger-Gateau, Pascale', 'Lambert, Jean-Charles', 'Feart, Catherine', 'Peres, Karine', 'Ritchie, Karen', 'Dartigues, Jean-Francois', 'Alperovitch, Annick']","['Barberger-Gateau P', 'Lambert JC', 'Feart C', 'Peres K', 'Ritchie K', 'Dartigues JF', 'Alperovitch A']","['INSERM, U897, Bordeaux, France.

Moreover, the currently available diagnostic tools are not sufficient for an early screening of AD in order to start preventive approaches. Recently the emerging field of nanotechnology has promised new techniques to solve some of the AD challenges. Nanotechnology refers to the techniques of designing and manufacturing nanosize (1-100 nm) structures through controlled positional and/or self-assembly of atoms and molecules. In this report, we present the promises that nanotechnology brings in research on the AD diagnosis and therapy. They include its potential for the better understanding of the AD root cause molecular mechanisms, AD's early diagnoses, and effective treatment. The advances in AD research offered by the atomic force microscopy, single molecule fluorescence microscopy and NanoSIMS microscopy are examined here. In addition, the recently proposed applications of nanotechnology for the early diagnosis of AD including bio-barcode assay, localized surface plasmon resonance nanosensor, quantum dot and nanomechanical cantilever arrays are analyzed. Applications of nanotechnology in AD therapy including neuroprotections against oxidative stress and anti-amyloid therapeutics, neuroregeneration and drug delivery beyond the blood brain barrier (BBB) are discussed and analyzed. All of these applications could improve the treatment approach of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Here we present a psychometrically robust method to profile apathy in AD. OBJECTIVES: To determine the validity and reliability of a multidimensional apathy measure, the Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS), and explore the apathy subtype profile and its associations in AD. METHODS: 102 people with AD and 55 healthy controls were recruited. Participants completed the DAS, the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), Geriatric Depression Short form (GDS-15), and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (LIADL). Psychometric properties of the DAS were determined. AD-Control comparison was performed to explore group differences on the DAS. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to explore the profile of apathy in AD. RESULTS: The DAS had a good to excellent Cronbach's standardized alpha (self-rated = 0.85, informant/carer-rated = 0.93) and good convergent and divergent validity against standard apathy (AES) and depression (GDS-15) measures. Group comparison showed people with AD were significantly higher for all apathy subtypes than controls (p < 0.001), and lacking in awareness over all apathy subtype deficits. LCA showed three distinct AD subgroups, with 42.2% in the Executive-Initiation apathy, 28.4% in the Global apathy, and 29.4% in the Minimal apathy group. CONCLUSIONS: The DAS is a psychometrically robust method of assessing multidimensional apathy in AD.

However, due to the non-feasibility of such methods, to diagnose and conclude the conditions, medical practitioners use tests that examine a patient's mental ability. OBJECTIVE: Accurate diagnosis at an early stage is the need of the hour for initiation of therapy. The cause for most Alzheimer's cases still remains unknown except where genetic distinctions have been observed. Thus, a standard drug regimen ensues in every Alzheimer's patient, irrespective of the cause, which may not always be beneficial in halting or reversing the disease progression. To provide a better life to such patients by suppressing existing symptoms, early diagnosis, curative therapy, site-specific delivery of drugs, and application of hyphenated methods like artificial intelligence need to be brought into the main field of Alzheimer's therapeutics. METHODS: In this review, we have compiled existing hypotheses to explain the cause of the disease, and highlighted gene therapy, immunotherapy, peptidomimetics, metal chelators, probiotics and quantum dots as advancements in the existing strategies to manage Alzheimer's. CONCLUSION: Biomarkers, brain-imaging, and theranostics, along with artificial intelligence, are understood to be the future of the management of Alzheimer's.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Khan, Sahil', 'Barve, Kalyani H', 'Kumar, Maushmi S']","['Khan S', 'Barve KH', 'Kumar MS']","[""SVKM'S NMIMS, Shobhaben Pratapbhai Patel School of Pharmacy and Technology Management, V.L.

However, scientific, pragmatic, regulatory, and business challenges need to be addressed before combination therapy for AD can become a reality. Leaders from academia and industry, along with a former member of the Food and Drug Administration and the Alzheimer's Association, have explored these challenges and here propose a strategy to facilitate proof-of-concept combination therapy trials in the near future. First, a more integrated understanding of the complex pathophysiology and progression of AD is needed to identify the appropriate pathways and the disease stage to target. Once drug candidates are identified, novel clinical trial designs and selection of appropriate outcome assessments will be needed to enable definition and evaluation of the appropriate dose and dosing regimen and determination of efficacy. Success in addressing this urgent problem will only be achieved through collaboration among multiple stakeholders.","[""Copyright (c) 2016 Alzheimer's Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Increased expression of RAGE is observed in regions of the brain affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Abeta-RAGE interaction in vitro leads to cell stress with the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of downstream signaling mechanisms including the MAP kinase pathway. RAGE-mediated activation of p38 MAP kinase in neurons causes Abeta-induced inhibition of long-term potentiation in slices of entorhinal cortex. Increased expression of RAGE in an Abeta-rich environment, using transgenic mouse models, accelerates and accentuates pathologic, biochemical, and behavioral abnormalities compared with mice overexpressing only mutant amyloid-beta protein precursor.

In order to exert this function, they need to phagocytose synapses as well as debris and dead cells, a process that is further amplified in pathological conditions. Importantly, it has been shown that microglia phagocytic capacity is altered in the course of neurodegenerative disease, for which aging is one of the highest risk factors. Thus, understanding how phagocytosis is impaired during aging is a priority for future research. Advances in this area are expected to significantly contribute to our understanding of normal cognition during aging, as well as changes that take place in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge on how phagocytosis is executed and affected by aging or in age-associated neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease of the elderly and is characterized by regional specificity of neural aberrations associated with higher cognitive functions. Aluminum (Al) is the most abundant neurotoxic metal on earth, widely bioavailable to humans and repeatedly shown to accumulate in AD-susceptible neuronal foci. In spite of this, the role of Al in AD has been heavily disputed based on the following claims: 1) bioavailable Al cannot enter the brain in sufficient amounts to cause damage, 2) excess Al is efficiently excreted from the body, and 3) Al accumulation in neurons is a consequence rather than a cause of neuronal loss. Research, however, reveals that: 1) very small amounts of Al are needed to produce neurotoxicity and this criterion is satisfied through dietary Al intake, 2) Al sequesters different transport mechanisms to actively traverse brain barriers, 3) incremental acquisition of small amounts of Al over a lifetime favors its selective accumulation in brain tissues, and 4) since 1911, experimental evidence has repeatedly demonstrated that chronic Al intoxication reproduces neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Misconceptions about Al bioavailability may have misled scientists regarding the significance of Al in the pathogenesis of AD. The hypothesis that Al significantly contributes to AD is built upon very solid experimental evidence and should not be dismissed.

Moreover, no investigation has focused on the possibility of monitoring peripheral BACE1 to assess the efficiency of BACE1 inhibitors during the course of clinical trials.

It is predicted that the incidence of AD will be increased in the future making this disease one of the greatest medical, social, and economic challenges for individuals, families, and the health care system worldwide. The etiology of AD is multifactorial. It features increased oxidative state and deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of protein tau in the central cortex and limbic system of the brain.

Regular physical activity increases the endurance of cells and tissues to oxidative stress, vascularization, energy metabolism, and neurotrophin synthesis, all important in neurogenesis, memory improvement, and brain plasticity.

Predicting ATN status in pre-dementia individuals therefore provides an important opportunity for targeted recruitment into AD interventional studies. We investigated the extent to which ATN-defined biomarker status can be predicted by known AD risk factors as well as vascular-related composite risk scores. METHODS: One thousand ten cognitively healthy older adults were allocated to one of five ATN-defined biomarker categories. Multinomial logistic regression tested risk factors including age, sex, education, APOE4, family history of dementia, cognitive function, vascular risk indices (high systolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), high cholesterol, physical inactivity, ever smoked, blood pressure medication, diabetes, prior cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation and white matter lesion (WML) volume), and three vascular-related composite scores, to predict five ATN subgroups; ROC curve models estimated their added value in predicting pathology. RESULTS: Age, APOE4, family history, BMI, MMSE and white matter lesions (WML) volume differed between ATN biomarker groups. Prediction of Alzheimer's disease pathology (versus normal AD biomarkers) improved by 7% after adding family history, BMI, MMSE and WML to a ROC curve that included age, sex and APOE4. Risk composite scores did not add value. CONCLUSIONS: ATN-defined Alzheimer's disease biomarker status prediction among cognitively healthy individuals is possible through a combination of constitutional and cardiovascular risk factors but established dementia composite risk scores do not appear to add value in this context.",,"['Calvin, Catherine M', 'de Boer, Casper', 'Raymont, Vanessa', 'Gallacher, John', 'Koychev, Ivan']","['Calvin CM', 'de Boer C', 'Raymont V', 'Gallacher J', 'Koychev I']","['Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital, Oxford, OX3 7JX, UK.', 'Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital, Oxford, OX3 7JX, UK.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital, Oxford, OX3 7JX, UK.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital, Oxford, OX3 7JX, UK. ivan.koychev@psych.ox.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['MR/L023784/2/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R380R/1114/DMT_/The Dunhill Medical Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Alzheimers Res Ther,Alzheimer's research & therapy,101511643,IM,"['Aged', '*Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides', 'Apolipoprotein E4', 'Biomarkers', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies']",PMC7650169,,2020/11/11 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/11/10 05:33'],"['2020/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/10 05:33 [entrez]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13195-020-00711-5 [pii]', '711 [pii]', '10.1186/s13195-020-00711-5 [doi]']",epublish,Alzheimers Res Ther. 2020 Nov 9;12(1):143. doi: 10.1186/s13195-020-00711-5.,['NOTNLM'],"['ATN framework', 'Risk scores', 'White matter lesions volume']","['JG was the recipient of an MRC grant for staff, which included a salary for CMC', 'and IK.

Nevertheless, Abeta toxicity has been probed in vitro and in vivo and increased production or decreased clearance of Abeta peptides are reported to play a major role in the development of AD. Treatment of neural stem cells with Abeta in vitro induces neuronal differentiation. Increased neurogenesis has been also described in AD patients as well as in amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) transgenic mice. Adult neurogenesis is greatly enhanced in young AbetaPP transgenic mice, before other AD-liked pathologies, and reduced in older animals.

METHODS: We assessed internal consistency, structural validity, convergent validity, and 2-year internal and external responsiveness of the CDR-SB using data from 382 subjects with early or mild AD at entry into the ADNI study. RESULTS: The CDR-SB assesses both cognitive and functional domains of AD disability. Mean scores declined nearly linearly; CDR-SB cognitive and functional subsums contributed equally to total scores at both very mild (early) and mild stages of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The CDR-SB has psychometric properties that make it attractive as a primary outcome measure that comprehensively assesses both cognitive and functional disability in AD patients.

Missense gene mutations involved in increased formation of the amyloid-beta protein precursor derivatives amyloid-beta (Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42/43) lead to autosomal dominant familial AD, found in the minority of AD cases. However, millions of subjects suffer from sporadic AD (sAD) of late onset, for which no convincing evidence suggests Abeta as the primary disease-generating compound. Environmental factors operating during pregnancy and postnatally may affect susceptibility genes and stress factors (e.g., cortisol), consequently affecting brain development both structurally and functionally, causing diseases that only becoming manifest late in life. With aging, a desynchronization of biological systems may result, increasing further brain entropy/declining criticality. In sAD, this desynchronization may involve stress components, cortisol and noradrenaline, reactive oxygen species, and membrane damage as major candidates causing an insulin resistant brain state with decreased glucose/energy metabolism. This further leads to a derangement of ATP-dependent cellular and molecular work, of the cell function in general, as well as derangements in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus, axon, synapses, and membranes, in particular.

The 2050 projection for AD in the USA is 14 million. There is a strong association between AD, air pollution, and traffic. Early diagnosis is imperative for intervention in the initial disease stages. Hearing and, specifically, the ability to encode complex sounds are impaired in AD. Nuclei in the auditory brainstem appear to be sensitive to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Specifically, sustained exposure to air pollution is harmful to the brainstem; young residents of Metropolitan Mexico City (MMC) exposed to fine particulate matter and combustion-derived nanoparticles develop AD pathology in infancy. MMC clinically healthy children and teens have significant central delays in brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs). Herein, we review evidence that the auditory pathway is a key site of AD early pathology associated with air pollution and is significantly involved in AD patients.

There are more than 5 million diagnosed cases in the US alone and this number is expected to triple by 2050. Therefore, AD has reached epidemic proportions with significant socioeconomic implications. While aging in general is the greatest risk factor for AD, several additional demographic factors that have contributed to the rise in AD in the US are under study. One such factor is associated with the relatively fast growth of the Latino population. Several reports indicate that AD is more prevalent among blacks and Latinos. However, the reason for AD disparity among different ethnic groups is still poorly understood and highly controversial. The Latino population is composed of different groups based on nationality, namely South and Central America, Mexico, and Caribbean Hispanics. This diversity among the Latino population represents an additional challenge since there are distinct characteristics associated with AD and comorbidities. In this review, we aim to bring attention to the intersection between social determinants of health and genetic factors associated with AD within the Latino community. We argue that understanding the interplay between identified social determinants of health, co-morbidities, and genetic factors could lead to community empowerment and inclusiveness in research and healthcare services, contributing to improved diagnosis and treatment of AD patients. Lastly, we propose that inserting a neuroethics perspective could help understand key challenges that influence healthcare disparities and contribute to increased risk of AD among Latinos.",,"['Vega, Irving E', 'Cabrera, Laura Y', 'Wygant, Cassandra M', 'Velez-Ortiz, Daniel', 'Counts, Scott E']","['Vega IE', 'Cabrera LY', 'Wygant CM', 'Velez-Ortiz D', 'Counts SE']","['Department of Translational Science and Molecular Medicine, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Translational Science and Molecular Medicine, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.', 'Center for Ethics and Humanities in the Life Sciences, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.', 'Department of Translational Science and Molecular Medicine, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.', 'School of Social Work, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.', 'Department of Translational Science and Molecular Medicine, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.', 'Department of Family Medicine, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.', ""Hauenstein Neurosciences Center, Mercy Health Saint Mary's Hospital, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.""]",['eng'],"['P01 AG014449/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AG053760/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Alzheimer Disease/epidemiology/genetics/psychology', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Factors', '*Social Determinants of Health']",PMC5874398,['NIHMS951516'],2017/05/21 06:00,2018/05/23 06:00,['2017/05/21 06:00'],"['2017/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD161261 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-161261 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2017;58(4):979-992. doi: 10.3233/JAD-161261.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Latinos', 'health disparities', 'healthcare', 'social determinants of health']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An undue emphasis on single approaches to Alzheimer's disease (AD) appears to have retarded the pace of translation in the field, and there is much frustration in the public about the lack of an effective treatment. We critically reviewed past literature (1990-2014), analyzed numerous data, and discussed key issues at a consensus conference on Brain Ageing and Dementia to identify and overcome roadblocks in studies intended for translation. We highlight various factors that influence the translation of preclinical research and highlight specific preclinical strategies that have failed to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials. The field has been hindered by the domination of the amyloid hypothesis in AD pathogenesis while the causative pathways in disease pathology are widely considered to be multifactorial. Understanding the causative events and mechanisms in the pathogenesis are equally important for translation.

This study provides important information to expand our current understanding of the structure/activity relationship of ADAS and putative inhibitors/activators that are potentially involved in ADAS appearance/disappearance. The NCBI database analysis revealed that ADAS presents at a large proportion in American Indian Oklahoman (C&A) with a high prevalence of obesity/diabetes and in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients from the US and China. An Oklahoman non-native group (NNI) showed no ADAS. Comparison of two large US populations reveals that ADAS is more frequent in individuals aged >/=66 and in females. Prevalence and levels of fecal metabolites are altered in the C&A and CRC groups versus controls. Biogenic amines (histamine, tryptamine, tyramine, phenylethylamine, cadaverine, putrescine, agmatine, spermidine) that present in food and are produced by gut microbiota are significantly higher in C&A (e.g., histamine/histidine 95-fold) versus NNI (histamine/histidine 16-fold). The majority of these bio-amines are cytotoxic at concentrations found in food. Inositol phosphate signaling implicated in AD is altered in C&A and CRC. Tryptamine stimulated accumulation of inositol phosphate. The seizure-eliciting tryptamine induced cytoplasmic vacuolization and vesiculation with cell fragmentation. Present additions of ADAS-carriers at different ages including infants led to an ADAS-comprising human sample size of 2,830 from 27 studies from four continents (North America, Australia, Asia, Europe). Levels of food-derived monoamine oxidase inhibitors and anti-bacterial compounds, the potential modulators of ADAS-bacteria growth and biogenic amine production, were altered in C&A versus NNI.

Many laboratories are engaged in the discovery and validation of a wide array of potential genetic, proteomic, cognitive, and other types of biomarkers. METHODS: This review focuses on the application of quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) and event-related potential (ERP) technologies as markers of prodromal impairment and early disease progression. It is the aim of this review to critically assess where this field currently stands, as well as future directions for EEG biomarker development. RESULTS: As a neuroimaging tool that is relatively inexpensive, potentially portable, and capable of providing high-density spatial mapping, qEEG offers a noninvasive, rapid, and replicable method for assessing age-related and disease-related neurophysiologic change. CONCLUSIONS: As different signature changes associated with particular stages of disease burden are identified and validated, we anticipate expanded application of qEEG as a reliable and sensitive biomarker(s) of MCI and early Alzheimer's disease.",,"['Jackson, Colleen E', 'Snyder, Peter J']","['Jackson CE', 'Snyder PJ']","['Department of Psychology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Alzheimers Dement,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,101231978,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/complications/*physiopathology', '*Biomarkers', 'Brain/*physiopathology', 'Cognition Disorders/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Disease Progression', '*Electroencephalography', '*Evoked Potentials', 'Humans']",,,2008/07/22 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2007/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1552-5260(07)00625-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jalz.2007.10.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Alzheimers Dement. 2008 Jan;4(1 Suppl 1):S137-43. doi: 10.1016/j.jalz.2007.10.008.

Biomarkers exist for each. Neurodegeneration is often detected by neuroimaging, and we hypothesized that a voxel-based deep learning approach using structural MRI might outperform other neuroimaging methods. METHODS: First, we implement an MRI-based deep learning model, trained with a data augmentation strategy, which classifies Alzheimer's dementia and generates class activation maps. Next, we tested the model in prodromal AD and compared its performance to other biomarkers of amyloid pathology, tau pathology, and neuroimaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration. RESULTS: The model distinguished between controls and AD with high accuracy (AUROC = 0.973) with class activation maps that localized to the hippocampal formation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading neurodegenerative disorder throughout the world, is shown to have an epigenetic basis. Currently, there are very few effective epigenetic drugs available for AD. OBJECTIVE: In this work, for the first time we have proposed 14 AD repositioning epigenetic drugs and identified their targets from extensive human interactome. METHODS: Interacting partners of the AD epigenetic proteins were identified from the extensive human interactome to construct Epigenetic Protein-Protein Interaction Network (EP-PPIN). Epigenetic Drug-Target Network (EP-DTN) was constructed with the drugs associated with the proteins of EP-PPIN. Regulation of non-coding RNAs associated with the target proteins of these drugs was also studied. AD related target proteins, epigenetic targets, enriched pathways, and functional categories of the proposed repositioning drugs were also studied. RESULTS: The proposed 14 AD epigenetic repositioning drugs have overlapping targets and miRs with known AD epigenetic targets and miRs. Furthermore, several shared functional categories and enriched pathways were obtained for these drugs with FDA approved epigenetic drugs and known AD drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our work might provide insight into future AD epigenetic-therapeutics.",,"['Chatterjee, Paulami', 'Roy, Debjani', 'Rathi, Nitin']","['Chatterjee P', 'Roy D', 'Rathi N']","['Department of Biophysics, Bose Institute, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Biophysics, Bose Institute, West Bengal, India.', 'School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/drug therapy/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Computational Biology', 'Drug Repositioning/*methods', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Epigenomics/methods', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'PubMed']",,,2017/12/05 06:00,2018/07/14 06:00,['2017/12/05 06:00'],"['2017/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['JAD161104 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-161104 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2018;61(1):53-65. doi: 10.3233/JAD-161104.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'combined interactome', 'epigenetic drug repositioning', 'epigenetic drug targets', 'epigenetic drug-target network', 'epigenetic protein-protein interaction network', 'epigenetics', 'pathway enrichment analysis']",,,,"['0 (Antipsychotic Agents)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the question is to be asked whether common or diverging evaluation methods exist that can have an impact on the result. In principle, two methods are used: meta-analyses and responder analyses. Meta-analyses and the resulting effect sizes have to be interpreted according to the field of application (for example, the type and severity degree of a disease) with medical expertise. Omitting this can lead to incorrect evaluations and to a discrepancy of evaluation results. In the case of memantine, the merely biometric evaluation of meta-analyses performed by the IQWiG led to a denial of the benefit, while the same data, considering clinical routine, led professional associations to recommend memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer s disease. In contrast to meta-analyses, responder analyses directly show the benefit of a therapy option in the presence of significant group differences, as the selected responder criteria are based on the indication. The corresponding results of the responder analyses on memantine were also acknowledged by the IQWiG and led to a positive evaluation of memantine. This discrepancy of evaluation results illustrates the fact that statistical procedures are necessary when evaluating drug and non-drug therapy options but, that the interpretation of the results with medical expertise is essential.",['(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Therefore, in this study we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to shotgun cloning to discover novel STOX1A target genes. Our results show that CNTNAP2, a member of the neurexin family, is directly downregulated by STOX1A.

Neither traditional clinical-pathological studies nor modern in vivo biomarker investigations of brain amyloid load, however, could reveal a convincing relationship between brain Abeta load and cognitive deficits and decline in patients with AD. Evidence suggests that pathophysiological Abeta dysregulation and accumulation are very early events that precede the onset of cognitive impairment reaching a plateau at the clinical stage of the beginning dementia syndrome. Therefore, research efforts have focused on the role of Abeta in asymptomatic older adults: the results of combined amyloid-PET and neuropsychological studies show a modest but significant correlation between brain fibrillar amyloid load and various subtle cognitive deficits, most notably in challenging episodic associative memory tasks. In order to elucidate the pathophysiological link between cognition and Abeta, a number of combined functional neuroimaging studies have been performed, resulting in early and complex functional alterations in cognitively relevant neural networks such as the default mode network and the largely overlapping episodic memory networks. Multimodal studies using amyloid-tracing imaging methods and neurodegeneration biomarkers strongly suggest that neural network discoordination is specifically related to Abeta-mediated functional and potentially reversible disruption of synaptic plasticity rather than a direct consequence to neurodegenerative pathological processes. These pathophysiological processes and mechanisms may dynamically and non-linearly evolve through fully reversible adaptive compensatory stages and through reactive decompensatory stages into fully irreversible neurodegenerative stages of AD.",,"['Hampel, Harald']",['Hampel H'],"['Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.

However, because of the significant disparity between results, especially those between observational and randomized controlled trials (RCT), this postulate remains unproven. A significant contributing factor to these inconsistencies is the loose use of the generic definitions of estrogens and progestogens with most studies not delineating the clear differences between non-endogenous and endogenously identical (bioidentical) hormones, their molecular binding affinities and actions, and resultant metabolites. This is highlighted by the generalized terminological use of HT, which is often used to encompass significantly disparate hormonal formulations without clear demarcation. This has impacted and continues to significantly influence interpretations of data, meta-analyses, observational studies, etc., relevant to AD. To progress forward and allow unbiased interpretation, it is no longer acceptable to group HT formulations together as a homogenous group. This will also allow differentiation between compounds that exhibit beneficial actions and those that do not and whether these effects are specific or generalized.

Alternative hypotheses must explain three features: (i) why amyloid toxicity is not the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), (ii) what alternative mechanisms cause the degeneration and dementia of AD, and (iii) why increased amyloid accumulates in the brain in AD. We propose that AD, which occurs in elderly, already vulnerable brains, with multiple age-related changes, is precipitated by impaired microvascular function, resulting primarily from decreased Notch-related angiogenesis.

Some clinical and animal research revealed that AD combined with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) exacerbates AD progression by inducing blood-brain barrier dysfunction and fibrinogen deposition. Rivaroxaban, an anticoagulant, has been shown to reduce the rates of dementia in atrial fibrillation patients, but its effects on white matter and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this study was to explore the therapeutic effect of rivaroxaban on the white matter of AD+CCH mice. METHODS: In this study, the therapeutic effects of rivaroxaban on white matter in a mouse AD+CCH model were investigated to explore the potential mechanisms involving fibrinogen deposition, inflammation, and oxidative stress on remyelination in white matter. RESULTS: The results indicate that rivaroxaban significantly attenuated fibrinogen deposition, fibrinogen-related microglia activation, oxidative stress, and enhanced demyelination in AD+CCH mice, leading to improved white matter integrity, reduced axonal damage, and restored myelin loss.

We analyze the preparedness of Brazil, one of the most populous middle-income countries, from a capacity and institutional preparedness perspective. METHODS: Desk research and 12 interviews for background and capacity data. Markov model to estimate wait times for access to treatment. FINDINGS: Brazil has no national dementia strategy or established pathway for evaluation of cognitive concerns, and dementia is typically diagnosed late if at all. While members of private health plans have ready access to elective specialty care, wait times in the public sector are long. Assuming potentially treatment-eligible patients are referred from primary to specialty care based on a brief cognitive exam and a blood test for the Alzheimer's pathology, available capacity will not be sufficient to match the projected demand. The biggest obstacle is availability of dementia specialist visits, and the effect of population growth and ageing means that the wait list for specialist appointment will continue to grow from around 400,000 in 2022 to over 2.2 million in 2040. We do not project substantial wait times for confirmatory biomarker testing and treatment delivery but note that this is a consequence of patients waiting for their specialist appointments. These queues will result in estimated persistent wait times for treatment of around two years on average with substantial differences between the public and private sectors, as capacity growth is insufficient to keep up with increasing demand. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that Brazil is ill-prepared to provide timely access to an Alzheimer's treatment with predicted wait times of about two years, largely because of a limited number of dementia specialists.","[""(c) 2022 The Authors.

Since AD is a heterogeneous disease that shows several varied phenotypes, it is not easy to make an accurate diagnosis, so it arises when the symptoms are clear and the disease is already at an advanced stage. Therefore, it is important to find out biomarkers for early AD diagnosis that facilitate treatment or slow down the disease. Classic biomarkers are obtained from cerebrospinal fluid and plasma, along with brain imaging by positron emission tomography. Attempts have been made to discover uncommon biomarkers from other body fluids, which are addressed in this update. OBJECTIVE: This update aims to describe recent biomarkers from minimally invasive body fluids for the patients, such as saliva, urine, eye fluid or tears. METHODS: Biomarkers were determined in patients versus controls by single tandem mass spectrometry and immunoassays. Metabolites were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance and microRNAs with genome-wide high-throughput real-time polymerase chain reaction-based platforms. RESULTS: Biomarkers from urine, saliva, and eye fluid were described, including peptides/proteins, metabolites, and some microRNAs. The association with AD neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration was analyzed, highlighting the contribution of matrix metalloproteinases, the immune system and microglia, as well as the vascular system. CONCLUSION: Unusual biomarkers have been developed, which distinguish each stage and progression of the disease, and are suitable for the early AD diagnosis. An outstanding relationship of biomarkers with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration was assessed, clearing up concerns about the etiopathogenesis of AD.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Pomilio, Alicia B', 'Vitale, Arturo A', 'Lazarowski, Alberto J']","['Pomilio AB', 'Vitale AA', 'Lazarowski AJ']","['Departamento de Bioquimica Clinica, Area Hematologia, Hospital de Clinicas ""Jose de San Martin"", Universidad de Buenos Aires, Av.

A Systematic Review.,601-616,10.14283/jpad.2022.57 [doi],"OBJECTIVE: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was conducted to determine the effect of physical exercise on physical-functional capacity, cognitive performance, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life in a population of older people with Alzheimer s disease. DATA SOURCES: Pubmed, Scopus, PEDro, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, grey literature and a reverse search from inception to April 2021 were searched to identify documents. STUDY SELECTION: Publications investigating the effect of any type of physical exercise-based intervention in any of its multiple modalities on physical-functional capacity, cognitive performance, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life were searched. DATA EXTRACTION: The data were extracted into predesigned data extraction tables. Risk of bias was evaluated through the PEDro scale and its internal validity scale. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 8 different randomized controlled trials with a total sample of 562 non-overlap Alzheimer disease patients between 50-90 years and a mean age of 75.2 +/- 3.9 years were eligible for analyses. Physical-functional capacity was evaluated in 6 of 8 studies and cognitive performance was evaluated in 5 of 8 studies, all of them showed improvements in these variables when compared with the controls, except for two studies in physical-functional capacity and one study for cognitive performance. In the physical-functional capacity and cognitive performance variables, aerobic physical exercise was used in isolation, or in a multimodal way, combining aerobic, strength and balance exercise, from 2 to 7 weekly sessions with doses between 30 and 90 minutes, and a duration of the program comprised of 9 weeks to 6 months. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life were evaluated in 2 of 8 studies, which the intervention groups experienced significant improvements when compared with the control groups, except for one study that found similar differences in quality of life between both groups. In the neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life variables, only aerobic physical exercise was used, in a more homogeneous way, from 2 to 3 weekly sessions with doses of 30 to 60 minutes, and a total program duration of 9 to 16 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the scarcity of studies, especially those based on multimodal proposals, and the heterogeneity in the protocols, this systematic review found moderate to limited evidence that aerobic physical exercise on its own or combined in a multimodal program that also includes strength and balance exercise can be a useful tool in the management of patients with Alzheimer's disease with the aim of maintaining and/or improving physical-functional capacity and cognitive performance. In addition, this review found moderate evidence of the positive impact that aerobic physical exercise could have in reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms and improving quality of life in patients with Alzheimer s disease.

OBJECTIVE: To rank the effects of potentially dependent risk factors and identify an optimal parsimonious set of measures for predicting AD/ADRD risk from a larger pool of potentially correlated predictors. METHODS: We used diagnosis record, survey, and genetic data from the Health and Retirement Study to assess the relative predictive strength of AD/ADRD risk factors spanning several domains: comorbidities, demographics/socioeconomics, health-related behavior, genetics, and environmental exposure. A modified stepwise-AIC-best-subset blanket algorithm was then used to select an optimal set of predictors. RESULTS: The final predictive model was reduced to 10 features for AD and 19 for ADRD; concordance statistics were about 0.85 for one-year and 0.70 for ten-year follow-up. Depression, arterial hypertension, traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular diseases, and the APOE4 proxy SNP rs769449 had the strongest individual associations with AD/ADRD risk. AD/ADRD risk-related co-morbidities provide predictive power on par with key genetic vulnerabilities. CONCLUSION: Results confirm the consensus that circulatory diseases are the main comorbidities associated with AD/ADRD risk and show that clinical diagnosis records outperform comparable self-reported measures in predicting AD/ADRD risk.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations of HMGCR (rs3846662), NR1H2 (rs2695121), or CETP (rs5882&rs708272) with cognitive and functional changes in AD, with stratification according to APOEvarepsilon4 carrier status and lipid-lowering treatment with lipophilic statins. METHODS: Consecutive outpatients with late-onset AD were screened with cognitive tests, while caregivers scored functionality and global ratings, with prospective neurotranslational associations documented for one year. RESULTS: Considering n = 190:142 had hypercholesterolemia, 139 used lipophilic statins; minor allele frequencies were 0.379 (rs2695121-T:46.3% heterozygotes), 0.368 (rs5882-G:49.5% heterozygotes), and 0.371 (rs708272-A:53.2% heterozygotes), all in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. For APOEvarepsilon4 carriers: rs5882-GG protected from cognitive decline; rs5882-AA caused faster cognitive decline; carriers of rs2695121-CC or rs5882-AA were more susceptible to harmful cognitive effects of lipophilic statins; carriers of rs5882-GG or rs708272-AG had functional benefits when using lipophilic statins. APOEvarepsilon4 non-carriers resisted any cognitive or functional effects of lipophilic statins, while invariability of rs3846662 (all AA) prevented the assessment of HMGCR effects. When assessing CETP haplotypes only: rs5882-GG protected from cognitive and functional decline, regardless of lipophilic statin therapy; lipophilic statins usually caused cognitive and functional harm to carriers of rs5882-A and/or rs708272-A; lipophilic statins benefitted cognition and functionality of carriers of rs5882-G and/or rs708272-G. CONCLUSION: Reportedly protective variants of CETP and NR1H2 also slowed cognitive and functional decline particularly for APOEvarepsilon4 carriers, and regardless of cholesterol variations, while therapy with lipophilic statins might affect carriers of specific genetic variants.",,"['de Oliveira, Fabricio Ferreira', 'Bertolucci, Paulo Henrique Ferreira', 'Chen, Elizabeth Suchi', 'Smith, Marilia Cardoso']","['de Oliveira FF', 'Bertolucci PHF', 'Chen ES', 'Smith MC']","['Department of Morphology and Genetics, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Morphology and Genetics, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Morphology and Genetics, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['*Alzheimer Disease/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Cognition', 'Humans', '*Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pharmacogenomic Testing', 'Prospective Studies']",,,2022/03/22 06:00,2022/05/11 06:00,['2022/03/21 12:16'],"['2022/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2022/03/21 12:16 [entrez]']","['JAD215735 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-215735 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2022;87(1):359-372. doi: 10.3233/JAD-215735.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'dementia', 'drug therapy', 'hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors', 'neuropsychiatry', 'pharmacogenetics']",,,,['0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Animal studies indicate that exercise may be disease modifying through several mechanisms including reduction of AD pathology. We carried out a systematic review of intervention studies of physical exercise with hippocampal volume (on MRI), amyloid-beta, total tau, phosphorylated tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 18F-FDG-PET or amyloid PET as outcome measures in healthy subjects, patients with subjective memory complaints, mild cognitive impairment, or AD. We identified a total of 8 studies of which 6 investigated the effects of exercise on hippocampal volume in healthy subjects and 1 on CSF biomarkers and 1 on hippocampal volume in AD, and none investigating the remaining outcome measures or patient groups. Methodological quality of identified studies was generally low. One study found a detrimental effect on hippocampal volume and one found a positive effect, whereas the remaining studies did not find an effect of exercise on outcome measures. The present systematic study identified a relatively small number of studies, which did not support an effect of exercise on hippocampal volume.

Previous research has attempted to identify subsyndromes-sets of symptoms related to one another-to clarify underlying mechanisms and treatment targets. We examined the stability of these subsyndromes over time. METHODS: We administered the Neuropsychiatric Inventory annually for 3 years to 447 patients with Alzheimer's disease recruited from memory clinics. We conducted principal component analyses at each time point and multiple-group confirmatory factor analyses across time. RESULTS: Principal component analyses showed that no two time points shared the same factor structure. Factor solutions did not exhibit strong simple structures and substantial cross-loadings were common. Confirmatory analysis revealed significant differences in factor loadings and model fit over time. DISCUSSION: Symptoms cannot be neatly partitioned into discrete clusters that are stable over time. The findings highlight the significant challenges that clinicians and caregivers face and may help explain the lack of success in intervention studies.,"[""Copyright (c) 2018 the Alzheimer's Association.

In particular, pupil size has proved useful to investigate cognitive performance during online activities. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the oculomotor correlates of impaired performance of patients with mild Alzheimer's Clinical Syndrome (ACS) on a recently developed memory paradigm, namely the Short-Term Memory Binding Test (STMBT). METHODS: We assessed a sample of eighteen healthy controls (HC) and eighteen patients with a diagnosis of mild ACS with the STMBT while we recorded their oculomotor behaviors using pupillometry and eye-tracking. RESULTS: As expected, a group (healthy controls versus ACS) by condition (Unbound Colours versus Bound Colours) interaction was found whereby behavioral group differences were paramount in the Bound Colours condition. Healthy controls' pupils dilated significantly more in the Bound Colours than in the Unbound Colours condition, a discrepancy not observed in ACS patients. Furthermore, ROC analysis revealed the abnormal pupil behaviors distinguished ACS patients from healthy controls with values of sensitivity and specify of 100%, thus outperforming both recognition scores and gaze duration.

Participants have heterogeneous cognitive trajectories and many do not decline during trials, which reduces a study's power to detect treatment effects. Trials need enrichment strategies to enroll individuals who are more likely to decline. OBJECTIVES: To develop machine learning models to predict cognitive trajectories in participants with early Alzheimer's disease and presymptomatic individuals over 24 and 48 months respectively. DESIGN: Prognostic machine learning models were trained from a combination of demographics, cognitive tests, APOE genotype, and brain imaging data. SETTING: Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3), PharmaCog, and a Phase 3 clinical trial in early Alzheimer's disease were used for this study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2098 participants who had demographics, cognitive tests, APOE genotype, and brain imaging data, as well as follow-up visits for 24-48 months were included. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline magnetic resonance imaging, cognitive tests, demographics, and APOE genotype were used to separate decliners, defined as individuals whose CDR-Sum of Boxes scores increased during a predefined time window, from stable individuals. A prognostic model to predict decline at 24 months in early Alzheimer's disease was trained on 1151 individuals who had baseline diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's dementia from ADNI and NACC. This model was validated on 115 individuals from a placebo arm of a Phase 3 clinical trial and 76 individuals from the PharmaCog dataset. A second prognostic model to predict decline at 48 months in presymptomatic populations was trained on 628 individuals from ADNI and NACC who were cognitively unimpaired at baseline. This model was validated on 128 individuals from OASIS-3. RESULTS: The models achieved up to 79% area under the curve (cross-validated and out-of-sample). Power analyses showed that using prognostic models to recruit enriched cohorts of predicted decliners can reduce clinical trial sample sizes by as much as 51% while maintaining the same detection power. CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic tools for predicting cognitive decline and enriching clinical trials with participants at the highest risk of decline can improve trial quality, derisk endpoint failures, and accelerate therapeutic development in Alzheimer's disease.",,"['Tam, A', 'Laurent, C', 'Gauthier, S', 'Dansereau, C']","['Tam A', 'Laurent C', 'Gauthier S', 'Dansereau C']","['Christian Dansereau, Perceiv Research Inc, Montreal, Canada, christian@perceiv.ai.']",['eng'],['U01 AG016976/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,J Prev Alzheimers Dis,The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,101638820,IM,"['*Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Apolipoproteins E/genetics', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Cognitive Dysfunction/psychology', 'Humans', 'Neuroimaging/methods']",,,2022/07/17 06:00,2022/07/20 06:00,['2022/07/16 04:52'],"['2022/07/16 04:52 [entrez]', '2022/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/07/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.14283/jpad.2022.49 [doi]'],ppublish,J Prev Alzheimers Dis. 2022;9(3):400-409. doi: 10.14283/jpad.2022.49.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'clinical trials', 'cognitive decline', 'machine learning', 'trial enrichment']","['Dr Tam, Dr Laurent, and Dr Dansereau are employees of Perceiv Research Inc and', 'hold stocks/stock options in Perceiv Research Inc.

METHODS: A nationwide cohort born between 1980 and 2001 (index persons) were linked to their biological relatives (parents, grandparents, uncles/aunts) using Swedish national registers. We used Cox models to examine the cross-generation associations. RESULTS: Among relatives of 2,132,929 index persons, 3042 parents, 171,732 grandparents, and 1369 uncles/aunts had a diagnosis of AD. Parents of individuals with ADHD had an increased risk of AD (hazard ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.26-1.89). The associations attenuated but remained elevated in grandparents and uncles/aunts. The association for early-onset AD was stronger than late-onset AD. Similar results were observed for any dementia. DISCUSSION: ADHD is associated with AD and any dementia across generations. The associations attenuated with decreasing genetic relatedness, suggesting shared familial risk between ADHD and AD.","[""(c) 2021 The Authors.

As marginal symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) appear during the progressive course of the disease. A lack of self-awareness (anosognosia) of cognitive and functional impairments is often seen in patients with AD, and associations between anosognosia and other NPSs have been previously reported. To account for anosognosia pathogenesis neurocognitively, the cognitive awareness model (CAM) has been helpful for explaining the stream of events from sensory input to behavioural/affective and metacognitive outputs. According to CAM, there are three types of anosognosia: (i) primary anosognosia, (ii) executive anosognosia, and (iii) mnemonic anosognosia. These types of anosognosia are generated from different neurocognitive modulations leading to metacognitive outputs or behavioural/affective regulations. Primary anosognosia is considered to be caused by deficits in the metacognitive awareness system (MAS). While preserved MAS function is associated with milder depression and anxiety in AD, a severer depressive mood in patients with mild AD can inversely cause self-underestimation. The modulation of executive anosognosia is thought to be associated with dangerous/disinhibition behaviours and apathy among NPS sub-symptoms, via impairments of comparator mechanism (Cm) within the central executive system. Other neurobehavioral reactions linked to self-awareness include 'denying' and 'confabulation', and each of these reactions is thought to be affected by the MAS and a Cm. Denial of one's own memory impairments appears as a defensive reaction to protect against dysphoric feelings, and the confabulatory comment is instantly reaction constructed by fabrications according to misinterpretations of memory information about oneself. Similarly, the innovative development of a theoretical model (CAM) has contributed to explaining the mechanism of anosognosia and some neurobehavioral outputs from a neurocognitive perspective.",['(c) 2020 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society.'],"['Tagai, Kenji', 'Nagata, Tomoyuki', 'Shinagawa, Shunichiro', 'Shigeta, Masahiro']","['Tagai K', 'Nagata T', 'Shinagawa S', 'Shigeta M']","['Department of Psychiatry, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Airanomori Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['17K10317/JSPS KAKENHI/'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Psychogeriatrics,Psychogeriatrics : the official journal of the Japanese Psychogeriatric Society,101230058,IM,"['Aged', 'Agnosia/*diagnosis/etiology/psychology', 'Alzheimer Disease/*complications/diagnosis/*psychology', 'Awareness/physiology', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/*diagnosis/*psychology', 'Depression/diagnosis/psychology', 'Depressive Disorder/complications/psychology', 'Humans', 'Memory Disorders/*etiology/psychology', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'Neuropsychological Tests']",,,2020/01/14 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2020/01/14 06:00'],"['2018/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/psyg.12507 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychogeriatrics. 2020 May;20(3):345-352. doi: 10.1111/psyg.12507.

Clinical and laboratory diagnostic tools have been refined so that clinicians now can diagnose Alzheimer's disease with up to 90% accuracy. Criteria for clinical diagnosis have been outlined by a work group of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association. Key diagnostic tools include a complete patient history, mental status testing, and a thorough diagnostic workup to exclude the possibility of a reversible disease mimicking the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Currently, management of Alzheimer's disease involves a two-pronged approach: behavioral-supportive care and pharmacologic control of disruptive behavioral symptoms. In the future, drug therapy may be available to maintain memory and cognitive function. Cholinesterase inhibitors, which block the decrease in choline acetyltransferase activity associated with Alzheimer's disease, appear promising.

Therefore, researchers also look for the alternative approaches to its treatment. It is suggested that changes in human gut microbiome mediated by exercise could influence the development and progression of AD and a new term ""muscle-gut-brain axis"" is introduced. There is much evidence to support this assumption. The gut microbiology is closely related to a wide range of diseases of the nervous system and therefore any negative qualitative and quantitative changes in the composition of the gut microbiota can potentially contribute to the pathophysiology of AD. Research shows that the treatment of intestinal dysbiosis with probiotics/synbiotics/eubiotics can prevent or alleviate the symptoms of these chronic neurological diseases. Studies also point to the positive effects of movement on the health of seniors. A positive correlation can be found between cognitive functions and physical stress, both in the elderly and in AD patients. Even short-term interventions with a relatively low frequency seem to produce positive results, while physical activities can be performed by using relatively simple and cost-effective means. In addition, physical activity can significantly modulate gut microbiome. Thus, it can be concluded that physical activity in humans seems to correlate with gut microbiome, which can prevent the incidence and development of AD.",,"['Schlegel, Petr', 'Novotny, Michal', 'Klimova, Blanka', 'Valis, Martin']","['Schlegel P', 'Novotny M', 'Klimova B', 'Valis M']","['Department of Physical Education and Sports, Faculty of Education, University of Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Biomedical Research Centrum, University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Neurology, University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Neurology, University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Applied Linguistics, Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Neurology, University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alzheimer Disease/*microbiology/*therapy', 'Dysbiosis', '*Exercise', '*Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans']",,,2019/09/03 06:00,2020/11/06 06:00,['2019/09/03 06:00'],"['2019/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD190460 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-190460 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2019;71(3):861-878. doi: 10.3233/JAD-190460.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'cognitive disorders', 'dementia', 'exercise', 'microbiome', 'physical activity', 'probiotics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) represent the first line symptomatic therapy, whose benefit to harm ratio is still a matter of debate. Acetylcholinesterase enzyme is a core interest for pharmacological and toxicological research to unmask the fine balance between therapeutic drug efficacy, tolerability, safety, and detrimental effects up to adverse drug reaction. So far, a body of evidence advocated that an increased vagal tone was associated to an increased risk of gastrointestinal and cardiac side effects (negative chronotropic, arrhytmogenic, hypotensive effects), able to hamper ChEIs effects on cognition, reducing administration feasibility and compliance, especially in older and comorbid patients. Conversely, a growing body of evidence is indicating a protective role of ChEIs on overall cardiovascular mortality in patients with dementia, through a series of in vitro and in vivo investigations. The present review is aimed to report the up to date literature in the controversial field of ChEIs and cardioprotection in dementia, offering a state of the art, which may constitute the conceptual framework to be enlarged in order to build higher evidence.

The proximal cause of such resistance in AD dementia and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) appears to be serine inhibition of IRS-1, a phenomenon likely due to microglial release of inflammatory cytokines triggered by oligomeric Abeta. Studies on animal models of AD and on human brain tissue from MCI cases at high risk of AD dementia have shown that brain insulin resistance and many other pathologic features and symptoms of AD may be greatly reduced or even reversed by treatment with FDA-approved glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs such as liraglutide (Victoza).

It currently takes too many healthy people, too much money and too many years to evaluate the range of promising presymptomatic treatments using clinical endpoints. We have used brain imaging and other measurements to track some of the earliest changes associated with the predisposition to AD. We have proposed the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative (API) to evaluate investigational amyloid-modifying treatments in healthy people who, based on their age and genetic background, are at the highest imminent risk of developing symptomatic AD using brain imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and cognitive endpoints. In one trial, we propose to study AD-causing presenilin 1 [PS1] mutation carriers from the world's largest early-onset AD kindred in Antioquia, Colombia, close to their estimated average age at clinical onset. In another trial, we propose to study apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 homozygotes (and possibly heterozygotes) close to their estimated average age at clinical onset. The API has several goals: 1) to evaluate investigational AD-modifying treatments sooner than otherwise possible; 2) to determine the extent to which the treatment's brain imaging and other biomarker effects predict a clinical benefit-information needed to help qualify biomarker endpoints for use in pivotal prevention trials; 3) to provide a better test of the amyloid hypothesis than clinical trials in symptomatic patients, when these treatments may be too little too late to exert their most profound effect; 4) to establish AD prevention registries needed to support these and other presymptomatic AD trials; and 5) to give those individuals at highest imminent risk of AD symptoms access to the most promising investigational treatments in clinical trials.",,"['Reiman, Eric M', 'Langbaum, Jessica B S', 'Fleisher, Adam S', 'Caselli, Richard J', 'Chen, Kewei', 'Ayutyanont, Napatkamon', 'Quiroz, Yakeel T', 'Kosik, Kenneth S', 'Lopera, Francisco', 'Tariot, Pierre N']","['Reiman EM', 'Langbaum JB', 'Fleisher AS', 'Caselli RJ', 'Chen K', 'Ayutyanont N', 'Quiroz YT', 'Kosik KS', 'Lopera F', 'Tariot PN']","[""Banner Alzheimer's Institute, Phoenix, AZ 85006, USA. eric.reiman@bannerhealth.com""]",['eng'],"['R01 MH057899/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG031581/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AG031581/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG031581-14/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01MH57899/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AG019610-12/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30AG19610/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AG010483/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AG019610/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH057899-09/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/cerebrospinal fluid/genetics/*pathology/*prevention & control', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging']",PMC3343739,['NIHMS368438'],2011/10/06 06:00,2012/02/10 06:00,['2011/10/06 06:00'],"['2011/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['YN888023206G71H0 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-2011-0059 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2011;26 Suppl 3(Suppl 3):321-9. doi: 10.3233/JAD-2011-0059.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immediate verbal recall declined with simulated HL, suggesting that auditory factors are confounding variables in cognitive assessment and result in the underestimation of cognitive functioning.",,"['Fullgrabe, Christian']",['Fullgrabe C'],"['Ear Institute, University College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],,['Letter'],Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Humans', '*Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/psychology', '*Hearing Loss/diagnosis/etiology/psychology', 'Cognition', '*Deafness', 'Neuropsychological Tests', '*Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnosis/etiology']",,,2022/12/05 06:00,2023/01/25 06:00,['2022/12/04 06:52'],"['2022/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/01/25 06:00 [medline]', '2022/12/04 06:52 [entrez]']","['JAD215695 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-215695 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2023;91(2):537-541. doi: 10.3233/JAD-215695.,['NOTNLM'],"['Age-related hearing loss', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Hopkins Verbal Learning Test', 'auditory bias', 'cognitive assessment', 'dementia', 'impairment simulation', 'screening']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An Overview on the Bright Light Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease Sleep Disorders.,113-125,10.3233/JAD-200478 [doi],"BACKGROUND: A system of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells provides 'non-visual' information on the circadian sequences of light to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which, as the 'master clock', synchronizes the chronobiological mechanisms of all the biological clocks. Damage to SCN structure alters circadian behavioral and hormonal rhythms and interferes with a regular sleep-wake pattern. Several studies have shown that, in aging and in Alzheimer's disease (AD), circadian rhythms change their synchronization with the environment and behavior loses sync with light. OBJECTIVE: The current overview aims to examine research studies showing the effect of bright light therapy (BLT) on sleep disorders and sleep-wake patterns in AD. METHODS: A literature search was conducted, taking into consideration the relevant studies over the last 20 years. Fifteen studies have been thorough: seven followed an environmental-architectural approach and eight followed a treatment devices approach. RESULTS: Studies agree in considering BLT as a promising non-pharmacological intervention to compensate for circadian rhythm alterations and they support the need for standardized protocols that allow a comparison between multicenter studies. CONCLUSION: Interestingly, in an attempt to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, health authorities have forced the population to stay home. Therefore, AD people are not currently able to enjoy exposure to sunlight. It is predictable that they may experience an exacerbation of circadian disturbances and that the BLT can be an effective response to prevent such exacerbation.",,"['Roccaro, Ilaria', 'Smirni, Daniela']","['Roccaro I', 'Smirni D']","['Department of Psychology, Educational Science and Human Movement, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Psychology, Educational Science and Human Movement, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/complications/physiopathology/*therapy', 'COVID-19', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Humans', 'Pandemics', 'Phototherapy/*methods', 'Pneumonia, Viral', 'Sleep Wake Disorders/etiology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Sunlight', 'Suprachiasmatic Nucleus']",,,2020/08/18 06:00,2020/09/18 06:00,['2020/08/18 06:00'],"['2020/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD200478 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-200478 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2020;77(1):113-125. doi: 10.3233/JAD-200478.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'biological clocks', 'bright light therapy', 'circadian rhythms', 'light boxes', 'retinal ganglion cells', 'sleep disorder', 'suprachiasmatic nucleus']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The definition of AD has changed over the past years, offering an ever more detailed definition of pre-morbid and pre-clinical status, but without a similar strong emphasis on the role of aging as the main risk factor. In fact, while early-onset AD is a clear consequence of gene mutations, late-onset AD is more likely due to a gradual accumulation of age-related damages. The pathogenetic amyloid cascade hypothesis has been recently questioned due to multiple clinical failures. Furthermore, several studies reported that cognitively normal elderly have a high amyloid deposition in the brain comparable to the levels observed in old age subjects with AD. This suggests that amyloid accumulation enters into the normal process of aging and what really triggers neuronal death and clinical manifestation in late-onset AD still needs further explanation. In this context, 'normal brain aging' and AD might represent a different pathway of successful or failed capability to adapt brain structures and cerebral functions. Cellular senescence and age-related changes affecting the brain may be considered as biologic manifestations of increasing entropy. Bioenergetic deficits due to mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to progressive neuronal death and clinical expression of dementia. So, increased amyloid in the brain of old age subjects may represent the downstream event expression of a biological system that is cooling down because of its exhaustion and not the core causative factor of late-onset dementia.",,"['Mecocci, Patrizia', 'Baroni, Marta', 'Senin, Umberto', 'Boccardi, Virginia']","['Mecocci P', 'Baroni M', 'Senin U', 'Boccardi V']","['Department of Medicine, Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics, University of Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics, University of Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics, University of Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics, University of Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Age of Onset', 'Aging/pathology/*physiology', 'Alzheimer Disease/epidemiology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Amyloid/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Brain/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/metabolism']",,,2018/03/23 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/03/23 06:00'],"['2018/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/03/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD179903 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-179903 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2018;64(s1):S397-S404. doi: 10.3233/JAD-179903.,['NOTNLM'],"['Aging', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'amyloid', 'energy', 'entropy', 'mitochondria', 'old age']",,,,['0 (Amyloid)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a tractography-based DTI reconstruction of the middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), and the left and right superior cerebellar peduncles separately (SCPL and SCPR) and addressed the differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (Dax), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD) in the three tracts between 50 patients with AD and 25 healthy subjects. We found that AD patients showed a lower FA and a higher RD compared to healthy subjects in MCP, SCPL, and SCPR. Moreover, higher MD was found in SCPR and SCPL and higher Dax in SCPL.

We demonstrate that a two-phase trial design in which drug dosing is administered after a certain level of disease severity has been reached, coupled with a method to account more accurately for the progression of the disease, may allow us to compensate for these factors, and thus enable us to make treatment effects more apparent.

The cumulative efforts by multiple groups have lead to the identification of three autosomal dominant genes for early onset AD. These are the amyloid-beta protein precursor gene (APP), and the genes encoding presenilin1 and 2. The knowledge derived from this work has firmly established Abeta as a critical disease molecule and lead to candidate drugs currently in treatment trials. Work on a related disease, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism - chromosome 17 type has also added to our understanding of pathogenesis by revealing that tau, the protein component of neurofibrillary tangles, is also a critical molecule in neurodegeneration. Lessons learned that still influence work on human genetics include the need to recognize and deal with genetic heterogeneity, a feature common to many genetic disorders. Genetic heterogeneity, if recognized, can be source of information. Another critical lesson is that clinical, molecular, and statistical scientists need to work closely on disease projects to succeed in solving the complex problems of common genetic disorders.",,"['Schellenberg, Gerard D']",['Schellenberg GD'],['Zachdad@u.washington.edu'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer Disease/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/genetics/metabolism', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Humans', 'tau Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,,2006/08/18 09:00,2006/10/20 09:00,['2006/08/18 09:00'],"['2006/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3233/jad-2006-9s341 [doi]'],ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2006;9(3 Suppl):367-72. doi: 10.3233/jad-2006-9s341.,,,,,,"['0 (Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor)', '0 (tau Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To analyze the effect of galantamine on BPSD and caregiver burden, we treated a total of 50 patients with mild AD for 12 weeks and evaluated them using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Japanese version of the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI). We also performed regional cerebral blood flow single photon emission computed tomography (rCBF SPECT) at baseline using three-dimensional sterotatic surface projections. Total NPI and ZBI scores did not significantly change after 12-week galantamine treatment. To identify the characteristics of patients who showed improvement after galantamine treatment, we divided patients into two groups, those with and those without sub-items on the NPI. Patients with aggression showed improvement in ZBI scores (p < 0.05). A comparison of rCBF SPECT between these two groups indicated that patients with aggression exhibited increased rCBF in the right prefrontal cortex compared with those without aggression. In a patient with aggression, 20-month treatment with galantamine inhibited increases in the rCBF area in the right prefrontal lobe.

These abnormal discharges occur predominantly during sleep and may be associated with accelerated disease progression. Subclinical spikes may represent a relevant target for clinical drug interventions, and there is a clear unmet need for preclinical testing of novel disease modifying agents in suitable animal models. Transgenic rodent models of AD pathology exhibit various forms of epileptiform EEG activity related to the abnormal levels of amyloid species in the brain. Among them, large-amplitude cortical and hippocampal EEG spikes in mouse and rat AD models may be reminiscent of the subclinical epileptiform EEG spikes recorded in some AD patients. This article reports the recommendations of a multidisciplinary panel of experts on optimal EEG markers and experimental designs to measure and report epileptiform activities and their response to symptomatic and disease-modifying drugs in transgenic AD model rodents. These recommendations may harmonize future preclinical EEG studies in the drug discovery research and may increase the comparability of experimental outcomes and their translational clinical value.",,"['Jin, Nanxiang', 'Babiloni, Claudio', 'Drinkenburg, Wilhelmus H', 'Hajos, Mihaly', 'Nygaard, Haakon B', 'Tanila, Heikki']","['Jin N', 'Babiloni C', 'Drinkenburg WH', 'Hajos M', 'Nygaard HB', 'Tanila H']","['A.

It was hypothesised that the VSTMBT would be an early indicator while the FCSRT would inform on imminent progression. METHODS: Healthy older adults (n=70) and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n=80) were recruited and followed up between 2012 and 2017. Participants with at least two assessment points entered the study. Using baseline and follow-up assessments four groups were defined: Older adults who were healthy (HOA), with very mild cognitive but not functional impairment (eMCI), and with MCI who did and did not convert to dementia (MCI converters and non-converters). RESULTS: Only the VSTMBT predicted group membership in the very early stages (HOA vs eMCI). As the disease progressed, the FCSRT became a strong predictor excluding the VSTMB from the models. Their complementary value was high during the mid-prodromal stages and decreased in stages closer to dementia. DISCUSSION: The study supports the notion that neuropsychological assessment for AD needs to abandon the notion of one-size-fits-all. A memory toolkit for AD needs to consider tools that are early indicators and tools that suggest imminent progression. The VSTMBT and the FSCRT are such tools.",['(c) 2022.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency of psychological disorders among the participants of the API ADAD Colombia clinical study, treated by a holistic mental health team during the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of use of mental health team services was explored considering different risk factors, and users and non-users of these services were compared. METHODS: Participants had free and optional access to psychology and psychiatry services, outside of the study protocol. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze the frequency of the mental health difficulties. A multivariable logistic regression model has been used to assess associations with using this program. RESULTS: 66 participants were treated by the Mental Health Team from March 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. Before and after the start of the pandemic, the most common psychological problems were anxiety (36.4% before, 63.6% after) and depression (34.8% before, 37.9% after). 70% of users assisted by psychology and 81.6% of those assisted by psychiatry felt that the services were useful for them. Female sex, depression, and anxiety before the pandemic were positively associated with being assisted by either psychology or psychiatry, while the association with hyperlipidemia was negative.

Due to the limited information available on the exact pathophysiology of the disease, over the last years there have been extensive efforts on the identification of possible risk factors, but no conclusive data have been obtained. Some risk factors have been identified but no clear evidence on what is clearly associated with the occurrence and progression of AD are available, and in particular no effective preventive strategies have been found. One of the most intriguing and appealing lines of investigation is the association between lifestyle habits such as diet and dietary compounds and the occurrence of AD. In this review, we focus on studies that investigated the association between nutrition and AD, paying particular attention to the role of a dietary pattern such as a Mediterranean-like diet on the occurrence of such disease. Studies in support of Mediterranean diet as an optimal diet for prevention of cardiovascular and major chronic diseases has rapidly evolved. A recent meta-analysis from our group, comprising prospective studies that investigated the association between adherence to Mediterranean diet and health status, showed a significant association between a greater adherence to Mediterranean diet and a reduced risk of major chronic degenerative diseases, including AD.

Although the combination of these disorders, called 'mixed' dementia, is recognized, the prevailing clinical and research perspective continues to consider AD and VaD as independent disorders. A review of recent neuropathological and neuropsychological literature reveals that these two disorders frequently co-occur and so-called 'pure' AD or VaD is comparatively rare. In addition, recent research shows that vascular dysfunction not only potentiates AD pathology, but that pathological changes in AD may subsequently induce vascular disorders. On the basis of these data, we propose that the neurobiological underpinnings underlying AD/VaD dementia and their neuropsychological phenotypes are best understood as existing along a clinical/pathological continuum or spectrum. We further propose that in conjunction with current diagnostic criteria, statistical modeling techniques using neuropsychological test performance should be leveraged to construct a system to classify AD/VaD spectrum dementia in order to test hypotheses regarding how mechanisms related to AD and VaD pathology interact and influence each other.",,"['Emrani, Sheina', 'Lamar, Melissa', 'Price, Catherine C', 'Wasserman, Victor', 'Matusz, Emily', 'Au, Rhoda', 'Swenson, Rodney', 'Nagele, Robert', 'Heilman, Kenneth M', 'Libon, David J']","['Emrani S', 'Lamar M', 'Price CC', 'Wasserman V', 'Matusz E', 'Au R', 'Swenson R', 'Nagele R', 'Heilman KM', 'Libon DJ']","['Department of Psychology, Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ, USA.', ""Department of Behavioral Sciences and the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."", 'Department of Clinical and Health Psychology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ, USA.', 'New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging, School of Osteopathic Medicine, Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Neurology, Epidemiology, Boston University Schools of Medicine & Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Clinical Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Grand Forks, ND, USA.', 'New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging, School of Osteopathic Medicine, Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, Brain Rehabilitation Research Center, Malcom Randall VA Medical Center, Center for Cognitive Aging and Memory - Clinical Translational Research Program, and Center for Neuropsychological Studies, University of Florida, Gainseville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ, USA.', 'New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging, School of Osteopathic Medicine, Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],"['K23 NS060660/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NR014181/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*classification/*diagnosis/pathology/psychology', 'Dementia, Vascular/*classification/*diagnosis/pathology/psychology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Neuropsychological Tests']",,,2019/12/10 06:00,2021/04/21 06:00,['2019/12/10 06:00'],"['2019/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD190654 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-190654 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2020;73(1):63-71. doi: 10.3233/JAD-190654.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'episodic memory', 'executive control', 'mixed dementia', 'vascular dementia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are also involved in the development and pathological mechanism of AD. Hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is a transcriptional factor responsible for cellular and tissue adaption to low oxygen tension. Emerging evidence has revealed HIF-1alpha as a potential medicinal target for neurodegenerative diseases. On the one hand, HIF-1alpha increases AbetaPP processing and Abeta generation by promoting beta/gamma-secretases and suppressing alpha-secretases, inactivates microglia and reduces their activity, contributes to microglia death and neuroinflammation, which promotes AD pathogenesis. On the other hand, HIF-1alpha could resist the toxic effect of Abeta, inhibits tau hyperphosphorylation and promotes microglial activation.

However, the cost of diagnosis, including the time leading up to it, has not been studied thoroughly. Furthermore, regionalized healthcare structure could result in differences in the pre-diagnostic costs for people with suspected AD. OBJECTIVE: This study set out to estimate the excess healthcare costs before and after AD diagnosis compared to a matched non-AD population and to investigate regional variation in AD healthcare costs in Denmark. METHODS: We used a register-based cohort of 25,523 matched pairs of new cases of AD and non-AD controls. The healthcare costs included costs on medication, and inpatient-, outpatient-, and primary care visits. Generalized estimating equations were employed to estimate the excess healthcare cost attributable to diagnosing AD, and the variation in costs across regions. RESULTS: Mean excess costs attributable to AD were euro 3,284 and euro 6,173 in the year before and after diagnosis, respectively. Regional differences in healthcare costs were identified in both the AD and control groups and were more pronounced in patients with AD (PwAD). CONCLUSION: PwAD incur higher healthcare costs across all cost categories in the year before and after diagnosis. Regional differences in healthcare utilization by PwAD may reveal potential variation in access to healthcare. These findings suggest that a more standardized and targeted diagnostic process may help reduce costs and variation in access to healthcare.",,"['Eithz, Nanna', 'Sorensen, Jan', 'Sopina, Liza']","['Eithz N', 'Sorensen J', 'Sopina L']","['Danish Centre for Health Economics, IST, SDU, Odense, Denmark.', 'Healthcare Outcomes Research Centre, RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Danish Centre for Health Economics, IST, SDU, Odense, Denmark.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Humans', 'Cohort Studies', '*Alzheimer Disease/therapy/drug therapy', 'Health Care Costs', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Denmark/epidemiology']",,,2023/04/18 06:00,2023/05/23 06:42,['2023/04/17 06:13'],"['2023/05/23 06:42 [medline]', '2023/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/04/17 06:13 [entrez]']","['JAD220821 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-220821 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2023;93(2):421-433. doi: 10.3233/JAD-220821.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'cohort study', 'cost', 'diagnosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of subjects with cognitive impairment increases with aging but the oldest old (>/=85 years of age), the fastest growing age group, is still the most unknown from a biological point of view. For this reason, the aim of our narrative mini-review is to evaluate the pertinence of the new criteria for AD diagnosis in the oldest old.

Nevertheless, the exact underlying mechanism is unknown. Moreover, a clinically translatable approach through modulating microglia for treating AD-associated NP is not available. Here, in a doxycycline-induced mouse model (rTg4510) for AD, we showed development of NP. We found that the total number of microglia in the CA3 region was not increased, but polarized to pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype, with concomitant increases in production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. To examine whether this microglia polarization plays an essential role in the AD-associated NP, we generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype PHP.B (capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier) carrying shRNA for DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) under a microglia-specific TMEM119 promoter (AAV-pTMEM119-shDNMT1), which specifically targeted microglia and induced a M2-like polarization in vitro and in vivo in doxycycline-treated rTg4510 mice. Intravenous infusion of AAV-pTMEM119-shDNMT1 induced M2-polarization of microglia and attenuated both AD-associated behavior impairment but also NP in the doxycycline-treated rTg4510 mice. Thus, our data suggest that AD-associated NP may be treated through M2-polarization of microglia.",,"['Jin, Jing', 'Guo, Jia', 'Cai, Hongbin', 'Zhao, Chongchong', 'Wang, Huan', 'Liu, Zhiyan', 'Ge, Zhao-Ming']","['Jin J', 'Guo J', 'Cai H', 'Zhao C', 'Wang H', 'Liu Z', 'Ge ZM']","['Department of Neurology, the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Neurology, the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Neurology, the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Neurology, the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Neurology, the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Neurology, the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Neurology, the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/complications/metabolism/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microglia/*cytology', 'Neuralgia/complications/metabolism/*therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",,,2020/04/14 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2020/04/14 06:00'],"['2020/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD200099 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-200099 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2020;76(4):1255-1265. doi: 10.3233/JAD-200099.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'microglia polarization', 'neuropathic pain', 'shDNMT1']",,,,['0 (Cytokines)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we examine the improvement in diagnostic accuracy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) when assessing both cognitive functioning and odor identification. OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of odor identification as a supplementary screening test in incipient AD. METHODS: Sniffin' Sticks Odor Identification Test (SS-OIT) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were administered in 262 AD, 174 MCI [150 amnestic (aMCI), and 24 non-amnestic (naMCI)], and 292 healthy older adults (HOA). RESULTS: Odor identification scores were higher in HOA relative to MCI or AD groups, and MCI outperformed AD. Odor identification scores were higher in aMCI single domain than aMCI multiple domain. Complementing MoCA scores with the SS-OIT significantly improved diagnostic accuracy of individuals with AD and MCI, including within MCI subgroups.

It exacerbates the fundamental pathology by generating a plethora of inflammatory mediators and neurotoxic compounds. Inflammatory cytokines, complement components, and toxic free radicals are among the many species that are generated. Microglia attack the pathological entities and may inadvertently injure host neurons. Recent evidence indicates that microglia can be stimulated to assume an antiinflammatory state rather than a proinflammatory state which may have therapeutic potential. Proinflammatory cytokines include IL-1, IL-6 and TNF, while antiinflammatory cytokines include IL-4 and IL-10. Complement activation is a separate process which causes extensive neuronal damage in AD through assembly of the membrane attack complex. Aggregated amyloid-beta is a potent activator of human complement but not of mouse complement. This is an important difference between AD and transgenic mouse models of AD. Many so far unexplored molecules may contribute to neuroinflammation or act to inhibit it. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) analysis identified 174 proteins that were upregulated by two-fold or more, and 189 that were downregulated by 2-fold or more following inflammatory stimulation of microglial-like THP-1 cells. Neurotoxicity may result from any combination of these and further exploration is clearly warranted. In addition, many small molecules may play a significant role.

METHODS: We investigated the prodromal phase of MCI over a 12-year period in 27 initially healthy participants with subsequent MCI preceding AD (NC-MCI) and 60 demographically matched healthy individuals (NC-NC). The longitudinal courses of cognitive performance (verbal and visual episodic memory, semantic memory, executive functioning, constructional praxis, psychomotor speed, language, and informant-based reports) were analyzed with linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: The sequence with which different cognitive functions declined in the NC-MCI relative to the NC-NC group began with verbal memory and savings performance approximately eight years, and verbal episodic learning, visual memory, and semantic memory (animal fluency) circa four years prior to the MCI diagnosis. Executive functioning, psychomotor speed, and informant-based reports of the NC-MCI group declined approximately two years preceding the MCI diagnosis.

Participants represented a broad range of research across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field, and varied in career stages from trainees and early stage investigators to established faculty, with attendance from the United States, Europe, and Asia. METHODS: In line with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiative on rigor and reproducibility, the workshop aimed to address training gaps in preclinical drug screening by providing participants with the skills and knowledge required to perform pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, and preclinical efficacy experiments. RESULTS: This innovative and comprehensive workshop provided training in fundamental skill sets for executing in vivo preclinical translational studies. DISCUSSION: The success of this workship is expected to translate into practical skills that will enable the goals of improving preclinical to clinical translational studies for AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Nearly all preclinical studies in animal models have failed to translate to successful efficacious medicines for Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. While a wide variety of potential causes of these failures have been proposed,deficiencies in knowledge and best practices for translational research are not being sufficiently addressed by common training practices. Here we present proceedings from an annual NIA-sponsored workshop focused specifically on preclinical testing paradigms for AD translational research in animal models aimed at enabling improved preclinical to clinical translation for AD.","[""(c) 2023 The Authors.

Numerous cellular hallmarks of aging contribute to the advancement of the pathologies associated with neurodegenerative disease. Not all cellular hallmarks of aging are independent and several fall into the broader category of cellular rejuvenation, which captures returning cells to a more youthful, improved functional state. Cellular rejuvenation is quickly becoming a hot topic in the development of novel therapeutic modalities for a range of diseases. Therapeutic approaches utilizing cellular rejuvenation technologies are rapidly advancing and will represent the next phase of AD therapeutics. This review focuses on two important processes, epigenetic reprogramming, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) that play a critical role in aging and in neurodegenerative diseases and the potential therapeutic approaches (gene therapy, small molecule) towards targeting these mechanisms. In aging and in AD, epigenetic changes on DNA (e.g., hypermethylation on CpG islands) lead to alterations in gene expression. Partial epigenetic reprogramming utilizes transcription factors to remove the epigenetic marks and to rejuvenate cells to a more youthful state. During aging and in neurodegenerative disorders, CMA becomes impaired resulting in a buildup of proteins known to be associated with neurodegenerative pathologies. The protein buildups lead to aggregates that preclude proteostasis leading to cell toxicity. Small-molecule CMA activators restore proteostasis and limit toxicity enabling cellular rejuvenation.",,"['Rosenzweig-Lipson, S']",['Rosenzweig-Lipson S'],"['Sharon Rosenzweig-Lipson, PhD, Life Biosciences, 75 Park Plaza, Boston, MA 02216, sharonr@lifebiosciences.com, 732-735-2066.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,J Prev Alzheimers Dis,The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,101638820,IM,"['Humans', '*Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy', 'Rejuvenation', '*Neurodegenerative Diseases', '*Alzheimer Disease/genetics/therapy', 'Epigenesis, Genetic']",,,2023/10/24 12:42,2023/11/02 12:42,['2023/10/24 08:43'],"['2023/11/02 12:42 [medline]', '2023/10/24 12:42 [pubmed]', '2023/10/24 08:43 [entrez]']",['10.14283/jpad.2023.106 [doi]'],ppublish,J Prev Alzheimers Dis. 2023;10(4):661-668. doi: 10.14283/jpad.2023.106.,['NOTNLM'],"['Epigenetic reprogramming', 'LAMP2A', 'OSK', 'cellular rejuvenation', 'chaperone-mediated autophagy']","['The author is a full-time employee of Life Biosciences and a consultant to', 'AgeneBio, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maintaining viable populations of mitochondria is therefore critical for normal cell function. The selective disposal of damaged mitochondria, by a pathway known as mitophagy, plays a key role in preserving mitochondrial integrity and quality. Mitophagy reduces the formation of reactive oxygen species and is considered as a protective cellular process. Mitochondrial dysfunction and deficits of mitophagy have important roles in aging and especially in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Preclinical AD trial participants are cognitively normal, functionally independent, and autonomous decision-makers. Yet, like AD dementia trials, preclinical trials require dual enrollment of a participant and a knowledgeable informant, or study partner. MAIN TEXT: The requirement of dyadic enrollment is a barrier to recruitment and may present unique ethical challenges. Despite these limitations, the requirement should continue. Study partners may be essential to ensure participant safety and wellbeing, including overcoming distress related to biomarker disclosure and minimizing risk for catastrophic reactions and suicide. The requirement may maximize participant retention and ensure data integrity, including that study partners are the source of data that will ultimately instruct whether a new treatment has a clinical benefit and meaningful impact on the population health burden associated with AD. Finally, study partners are needed to ensure the scientific and clinical value of trials. CONCLUSIONS: Preclinical AD will represent a new model of care, in which persons with no symptoms are informed of probable cognitive decline and eventual dementia. The rationale for early diagnosis in symptomatic AD is equally applicable in preclinical AD-to minimize risk, maximize quality of life, and ensure optimal planning and communication. Family members and other sources of support will likely be essential to the goals of this new model of care for preclinical AD patients and trials must instruct this clinical practice.",,"['Grill, Joshua D', 'Karlawish, Jason']","['Grill JD', 'Karlawish J']","['Departments of Psychiatry and Human Behavior and Neurobiology and Behavior, Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders, 3204 Biological Sciences III, University of California, Irvine, CA, 92697, USA. jgrill@uci.edu.', 'Departments of Medicine, Medical Ethics and Health Policy, and Neurology, Penn Memory Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 AG010124/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 AG016573/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AG056931/National Institute on Aging/']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Alzheimers Res Ther,Alzheimer's research & therapy,101511643,IM,"['*Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/prevention & control/psychology', 'Caregivers/*psychology', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Patient Participation/*psychology']",PMC5719524,,2017/12/08 06:00,2018/07/24 06:00,['2017/12/08 06:00'],"['2017/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13195-017-0327-x [pii]', '327 [pii]', '10.1186/s13195-017-0327-x [doi]']",epublish,Alzheimers Res Ther. 2017 Dec 6;9(1):93. doi: 10.1186/s13195-017-0327-x.,['NOTNLM'],"['Biomarker', 'Clinical trial', 'Informant', ""Preclinical Alzheimer's disease"", 'Study partner']","[""AUTHORS' INFORMATION: Joshua Grill, PhD, has served as an investigator on studies"", ""sponsored by Eli Lilly & Company, Biogen Idec, and the Alzheimer's Disease"", 'Cooperative Study.

Neurodegeneration (including neuronal atrophy and/or loss) are attributed to extraneuronal toxic amyloid oligomers and proteins, intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau, region-specific diminished cerebral glucose metabolism, synaptic dysfunction, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Several of these pathologic changes may occur decades before symptom onset, leaving ample time for implementing prevention strategies that target the earliest stages of the disease. In recent years, a myriad of modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors have been elucidated. We describe the latest criteria for the diagnosis of AD, including earliest diagnostic stage of preclinical AD, which has the highest potential for research, including diagnosis and disease modification. We discuss both FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments, as well as nonpharmacologic strategies for AD therapeutics, including prevention via evidence-based, low-risk interventions. Genotype is an important consideration in managing patients on the AD continuum, as presence of the APOE epsilon4 allele may influence response to treatment.

METHODS: 90 patients affected by AD living at home and 90 age- and sex-matched caregivers were enrolled. Patients and caregivers, coming from an urban-rural fringe of Southern Italy, were assessed using full MNA, Mini-Mental State Examination, Geriatric Depression Scale- short form, Activity of Daily Living, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scales. RESULTS: Malnutrition was found with high prevalence in patients affected by AD of different severity (more than 95% of patients were malnourished or at risk of malnutrition), and associated with reduced functional status. An altered nutrition was also recognized with high rate in the group of caregivers (23.3% were malnourished and 41.1% at risk of malnutrition) and the worse nutritional condition was correlated with higher age and lower functional and cognitive status and education. A positive correlation between MNA score of AD patients and caregivers was found.

OBJECTIVE: Assess the differences between AD and normal aging as regards kinematographic features of handwriting and elucidate writing deficits in AD. METHODS: The study included 23 patients with AD (78.09 years/SD = 7.12; MMSE 21.39/SD = 3.61) and 34 healthy controls (75.56 years/SD = 5.85; MMSE 29.06/SD = 0.78). Both groups performed alphabetical and non-alphabetical writing tasks. The kinematographic assessment included the average number of inversions per stroke (NIV; number of peaks in the velocity profile in a single up or down stroke), percentage of automated segments, frequency (average number of strokes per second), writing pressure, and writing velocity on paper. RESULTS: A total of 14 patients showed overt writing difficulties reflected by omissions or substitutions of letters. AD patients showed less automated movements (as measured by NIV), lower writing velocity, and lower frequency of up-and-down strokes in non-alphabetical as well as in alphabetical writing. In the patient group, Spearman correlation analysis between overt writing performance and NIV was significant. That means patients who had less errors in writing a sentence showed a higher automaticity in handwriting. The correctness of alphabetical writing and some kinematographic measures in writing non-alphabetical material reached excellent diagnostic values in ROC analyses. There was no difference in the application of pressure on the pen between patients and controls.

However, few of them utilize language models (LMs) to extract linguistic features and to investigate the lexical-level differences between AD and healthy speech. OBJECTIVE: Our goals include obtaining state-of-art performance of automatic AD detection, emphasizing N-gram LMs as powerful tools for distinguishing AD patients' narratives from those of healthy controls, and discovering the differences of lexical usages between AD patients and healthy people. METHOD: We utilize a subset of the DementiaBank corpus, including 242 control samples from 99 control participants and 256 AD samples from 169 ""PossibleAD"" or ""ProbableAD"" participants. Baseline models are built through area under curve-based feature selection and using five machine learning algorithms for comparison. Perplexity features are extracted using LMs to build enhanced detection models. Finally, the differences of lexical usages between AD patients and healthy people are investigated by a proportion test based on unigram probabilities. RESULTS: Our baseline model obtains a detection accuracy of 80.7%. This accuracy increases to 85.4% after integrating the perplexity features derived from LMs. Further investigations show that AD patients tend to use more general, less informative, and less accurate words to describe characters and actions than healthy controls. CONCLUSION: The perplexity features extracted by LMs can benefit the automatic AD detection from continuous speech.

In addition to genetics, which accounts for a small fraction of all cases, the etiology is multifactorial with other currently unknown triggers. It is crucial to unravel the physiological mechanisms that, being disrupted, could lead to neurodegeneration, as this knowledge could ultimately lead to the identification of novel neuroprotective strategies that could be used as therapeutics. Although mitochondrial dysfunction and the resultant oxidative stress are believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of both early- and late-onset AD, it is conceivable that the altered physiological state of the cells leading to sporadic AD could involve additional mechanisms. Much evidence suggests that epigenetic modification of gene expression can accumulate with age leading to an altered response to stress and to an enhanced susceptibility to diseases. Since aging has a major impact in different late-onset, complex diseases and, in particular, in the late-onset forms of AD, epigenetic alterations might play an important role in the pathophysiology of this disorder. Studies exploring this idea are underway and suggest that both methylation abnormalities in AD-related genes due to disruption of mechanisms that regulate the availability of methyl groups (SAM/HCY cycle) and changes of global histone acetylation levels might play a role in neurodegeneration. Thus, it is essential to undertake novel global approaches, which may lead to the development of new avenues for therapeutic intervention.",,"['Marques, Sueli C F', 'Oliveira, Catarina R', 'Outeiro, Tiago F', 'Pereira, Claudia M F']","['Marques SC', 'Oliveira CR', 'Outeiro TF', 'Pereira CM']","['Programa Doutoral em Biologia Experimental e Biomedicina, Centro de Neurociencias e Biologia Celular, Coimbra, Portugal.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['*Alzheimer Disease/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'DNA Methylation/*physiology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Nerve Degeneration/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology']",,,2010/06/18 06:00,2010/12/21 06:00,['2010/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['P5361M24244205T6 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-2010-100303 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2010;21(2):373-83. doi: 10.3233/JAD-2010-100303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trial results demonstrated that the implementation of cerebrospinal fluid and Abeta-PET biomarkers improves trial enrichment and outcome, which has led to a change in targeting strategy as clinical trials would be conducted with earlier, even presymptomatic, stages of the disease. Promising findings of outcomes, as measured by Abeta-PET and cerebrospinal fluid tau and P-tau, were, nevertheless, associated with antibody dose-dependent increased risk of severe adverse effects, specifically amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Aducanumab was associated with concomitant time-, dose-, and APOE-related incidence of ARIA in more than one-half of the patients within the high-dose arm. The future challenge will thus be to find biomarkers more favorably balanced between effective dosing of antibody to remove Abeta versus dosing to limit deleterious side effects. Interest was shown by Roche and Biogen, which promoted high-dose phase 3 trials. However, this generated some concerns related to a reasonable expected further increase in the incidence of severe side effects. What has been learned is challenging primary industry strategies for following-up and monitoring safety and effectiveness of anti-Abeta antibodies in clinical trials.

While a number of agents have been identified, additional factors may play a role. An association with diphtheria toxin was suggested by observations that vaccinations may provide protective effects, and the observation that decreased proteins synthesis in cortical regions from AD patients is associated with modification of elongation factor 2, the target of diphtheria toxin. While protection against diphtheria toxin is provided by vaccination, the known decline in the immune system associated with aging would result in a renewed sensitivity to the toxin. An association with diphtheria toxin would be consistent with the observations that the bacteria associated with the toxin, Corynebacterium diphtheria, is often found in the nasopharynx and an early symptom of AD is the loss of smell with a disease progression from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and the neocortical areas. If diphtheria toxin is involved in sporadic AD, booster vaccinations given to elderly individuals might result in a decreased incidence of this disease. As booster DPT vaccinations are already recommended for individuals over 65, cognitive testing at the time of the booster and 5 years later, along with similar cognitive testing in age-matched individuals who decline vaccination, might provide an inexpensive method to investigate whether diphtheria toxin plays a role in AD and the efficacy of DPT booster vaccines for AD.",,"['Merril, Carl R']",['Merril CR'],"['Retired Emeritus Scientist, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. merrilcarl@msn.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/epidemiology/*pathology/*prevention & control', 'Animals', 'Diphtheria/epidemiology/pathology/prevention & control', '*Diphtheria Toxin', 'Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Vaccine/*therapeutic use', 'Humans']",,,2012/12/29 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/12/29 06:00'],"['2012/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['M625431VH2R08W8P [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-121948 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2013;34(3):595-600. doi: 10.3233/JAD-121948.,,,,,,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Vaccine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and characterize differences in dietary and eating behavior among patients with early frontotemporal dementia (FTD) versus Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: This study administered the Food-Related Problems Questionnaire (FRPQ) to caregivers of 16 patients with FTD and 16 comparable patients with AD. The FRPQ was evaluated at initial presentation when patients presented for a diagnostic evaluation. RESULTS: Compared with the AD patients, the FTD patients had significantly more changes on the FRPQ. Subscale analysis indicated that the FTD patients showed impairment of observed satiety, improper taking of food, and inappropriate responses when food was not available. CONCLUSIONS: The use of food-related questionnaires, such as the FRPQ, can help distinguish FTD patients, early in their course, from those with AD and can further characterize the altered dietary and eating behavior.",,"['Mendez, Mario F', 'Licht, Eliot A', 'Shapira, Jill S']","['Mendez MF', 'Licht EA', 'Shapira JS']","['Department of Neurology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

In this context, astroglial cells are invariably involved in every kind of neuropathology. Mitotically, active glial cells provide metabolic support to active neurons, contribute to coupling between synaptic activity and local blood flow, and thus protect against oxidative stress. Disturbances of the complex neuron-glia interrelation are increasingly recognized as a potentially important pathophysiological mechanism in a wide variety of neurological disorders including those marked by neurodegeneration. Peripheral insulin resistance-mediated increased oxidative stress in glial cells, and consequent DNA damage, induces senescence in glial cells leads to the development of an inflammatory environment. The immune mediators released by senescent (activated) glial cells are considered to be neurotoxic and ultimately increase the oxidant load of neurons. While the neuron is viewed as the prototypical post-mitotic, fully differentiated cell, certain subsets of neurons reactivate cell-cycle activity in response to triggers of neuronal apoptosis, such as genotoxic stress generated by redox changes due to pathological alterations in supporting astroglial cells. Thus, a paradoxical cell cycle block in glial cells coupled with concomitant cell cycle re-entry in neurons (due to pathological alterations created by peripheral insulin resistance-induced neuroendocrine signaling changes) may cause neurodegeneration, such as seen in Alzheimer's disease.",,"['Erol, Adnan']",['Erol A'],"['Anatolia Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Silivri-Istanbul, Turkey. eroladnan@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aging/metabolism', 'Alzheimer Disease/enzymology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Neuroglia/enzymology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Neurons/enzymology/*metabolism/*pathology']",,,2010/01/12 06:00,2010/08/11 06:00,['2010/01/12 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['U45M33L342R72871 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-2010-1211 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2010;19(1):129-35. doi: 10.3233/JAD-2010-1211.,,,,,,,,,,,,49,,,,,,,,,,

Ethnic differences in caregiving occurred at multiple levels (intrapersonal, interpersonal, environmental) and in multiple domains (psychosocial health, life satisfaction, caregiving appraisals, spirituality, coping, self-efficacy, physical functioning, social support, filial responsibility, familism, views toward elders, use of formal services and health care). Only 18 of 47 intervention articles reported outcomes by caregiver ethnicity. Only 11 reported cultural tailoring; 8 were from the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH) initiative.

The present study examined the relationship between serum based biomarkers and specific ADLs in a sample of AD patients. Data were collected from 196 participants enrolled in the Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium Project and diagnosed with AD. BADLs were measured using the Lawton-Brody Physical Self-Maintenance Scale. A panel of 22 biomarkers previously found to be related to AD pathology was used for the analysis. Stepwise regression modeling was used to assess the link between the biomarkers and BADLs. Results were also examined by gender. Nine of the 22 biomarkers were significantly related to BADLs. When stratified by gender, the biomarkers accounted for 32% of the variance in the males and 27% in females. The pattern of significant biomarkers differed by gender with IL 7 and Tenascin C significantly related to BADLs for females and IL 15 significantly related to BADLs for males. The results of this study indicated that a small number of serum based biomarkers are related to BADLs, and these biomarkers differed by gender.",,"['Hall, James R', 'Johnson, Leigh A', 'Barber, Robert C', 'Vo, Hoa T', 'Winter, A Scott', ""O'Bryant, Sid E""]","['Hall JR', 'Johnson LA', 'Barber RC', 'Vo HT', 'Winter AS', ""O'Bryant SE""]","['Department of Psychiatry, Behavioral Health and Neuroscience, University of North Texas, Health Sciences Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA. james.hall@unthsc.edu']",['eng'],"['P30 AG012300/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG039389/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living/*psychology', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alzheimer Disease/blood/diagnosis/*psychology', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male']",PMC3644945,['NIHMS448649'],2012/05/11 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/05/11 06:00'],"['2012/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['W578685655788251 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-2012-111481 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2012;31(2):429-37. doi: 10.3233/JAD-2012-111481.,,,,,,['0 (Biomarkers)'],"[""Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium""]",,,,,,,"['Doody, Rachelle', 'Capriles, Violeta', 'Darby, Eveleen', 'Evans, Tracey', 'Williams, Benjamin', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Schrimsher, Gregory', 'Dentino, Andrew', 'Orozco, Ronnie', 'Tindall, Merena', 'Fairchild, Thomas', 'Knebl, Janice', 'Mains, Douglas', 'Alvarez, Lisa', 'Adams, Perrie', 'Rosenberg, Roger', 'Weiner, Myron', 'Quiceno, Mary', 'Reisch, Joan', 'Huebinger, Ryan', 'Xiao, Guanghua', 'Svetlik, Doris', 'Werry, Amy', 'Smith, Janet', 'Royall, Donald', 'Palmer, Raymond', 'Polk, Marsha']","['Doody R', 'Capriles V', 'Darby E', 'Evans T', 'Williams B', 'Zhang Y', 'Schrimsher G', 'Dentino A', 'Orozco R', 'Tindall M', 'Fairchild T', 'Knebl J', 'Mains D', 'Alvarez L', 'Adams P', 'Rosenberg R', 'Weiner M', 'Quiceno M', 'Reisch J', 'Huebinger R', 'Xiao G', 'Svetlik D', 'Werry A', 'Smith J', 'Royall D', 'Palmer R', 'Polk M']",,,,,,,

The workgroup sought to ensure that the revised criteria would be flexible enough to be used by both general healthcare providers without access to neuropsychological testing, advanced imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid measures, and specialized investigators involved in research or in clinical trial studies who would have these tools available. We present criteria for all-cause dementia and for AD dementia. We retained the general framework of probable AD dementia from the 1984 criteria. On the basis of the past 27 years of experience, we made several changes in the clinical criteria for the diagnosis. We also retained the term possible AD dementia, but redefined it in a manner more focused than before. Biomarker evidence was also integrated into the diagnostic formulations for probable and possible AD dementia for use in research settings. The core clinical criteria for AD dementia will continue to be the cornerstone of the diagnosis in clinical practice, but biomarker evidence is expected to enhance the pathophysiological specificity of the diagnosis of AD dementia. Much work lies ahead for validating the biomarker diagnosis of AD dementia.",['Copyright (c) 2011.

Nevertheless, besides the dramatic impact it imposes on the life of sufferers and their caregivers, AD, as well as other forms of dementia that affect the elderly, but also younger patients, also incurs in substantial healthcare costs for patients, their families and others, including society at large. The progressive aging of the population largely depending on improved preventive and curative healthcare is progressively worsening the situation because of the increasing number of elderly people and the consequent increase in dementia sufferers. Effective and cost-effective treatments are thus required for reversing, improving or preventing these cognitive impairments.

However, the dysregulation patterns of miRNA in blood hold potential as useful biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis and even treatment of AD. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research is to elucidate new miRNA biomarkers and create a machine-learning (ML) model for the diagnosis of AD. METHODS: We utilized pathways and target gene networks related to confirmed miRNA biomarkers in AD diagnosis and created multiple models to use for diagnostics based on the significant differences among miRNA expression between blood profiles (serum and plasma). RESULTS: The best performing serum-based ML model, trained on filtered disease-specific miRNA datasets, was able to identify miRNA biomarkers with 92.0% accuracy and the best performing plasma-based ML model, trained on filtered disease-specific miRNA datasets, was able to identify miRNA biomarkers with 90.9% accuracy. Through analysis of AD implicated miRNA, thousands of descriptors reliant on target gene and pathways were created which can then be used to identify novel biomarkers and strengthen disease diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Development of a ML model including miRNA and their genomic and pathway descriptors made it possible to achieve considerable accuracy for the prediction of AD.",,"['Xu, Amy', 'Kouznetsova, Valentina L', 'Tsigelny, Igor F']","['Xu A', 'Kouznetsova VL', 'Tsigelny IF']","['IUL Science Internship Program, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'San Diego Supercomputer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'BiAna, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'San Diego Supercomputer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'BiAna, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Neurosciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['*Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/genetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Humans', 'Machine Learning', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Neuroimaging']",,,2022/02/12 06:00,2022/04/12 06:00,['2022/02/11 12:12'],"['2022/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/04/12 06:00 [medline]', '2022/02/11 12:12 [entrez]']","['JAD215502 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-215502 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2022;86(2):841-859. doi: 10.3233/JAD-215502.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'machine learning', 'miRNA']",,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In his seminal paper, in 1907, Alzheimer thought to have shown a specific disease distinct from senile dementia. However, following the work of Fischer, Perusini, Kraepelin and Alzheimer himself, in 1911, the specificity of the pathological process with regard to that of senile dementia was questioned. Therefore, Alzheimer's disease was for long considered as related to senium praecox. Neuropathological then genetic data, mainly the description of monogenic forms, have demonstrated the reality of a specific pathological process involving the amyloid protein metabolism. Then, senile dementia became the most frequent form of Alzheimer's disease. However, Alzheimer's disease could hardly be considered as a natural entity and, particularly in the common forms, many points remained to be clarified such as the relationship between the amyloid process and that of aging, the significance of histopathological lesions and their relationship with the clinical symptoms. Beyond the description of the disease termed by his name, Alzheimer's work played a major role in the individualization of arteriosclerotic dementia from general palsy, and in the distinction between vascular and degenerative dementia.

Habitual aerobic activity was assessed by diary registrations. The AD group showed a lower physical capacity than controls at baseline but comparable levels of aerobic activity. During the follow-up period, physical capacity declined in the AD group, but the aerobic activity levels changed only marginally. Our results show that in the early stages of AD, people are capable of maintaining health-promoting aerobic activity levels, despite a decline in their physical capacity.

A novel strategy is proposed for the management of these disorders and as an adjuvant for psychiatric treatment of dementia and other related diseases through modulation of the microbiota (e.g. with the use of probiotics).",,"['Alkasir, Rashad', 'Li, Jing', 'Li, Xudong', 'Jin, Miao', 'Zhu, Baoli']","['Alkasir R', 'Li J', 'Li X', 'Jin M', 'Zhu B']","['Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, 100029, China.', 'China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, 100029, China.', 'Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China. zhubaoli@im.ac.cn.', 'Collaborative Innovation Centre for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Attainted Hospital College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China. zhubaoli@im.ac.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Protein Cell,Protein & cell,101532368,IM,"['*Alzheimer Disease/metabolism/microbiology/physiopathology/therapy', '*Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans']",PMC5291774,,2016/11/21 06:00,2017/06/06 06:00,['2016/11/21 06:00'],"['2016/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13238-016-0338-6 [pii]', '338 [pii]', '10.1007/s13238-016-0338-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Protein Cell. 2017 Feb;8(2):90-102. doi: 10.1007/s13238-016-0338-6.

AD progression is characterized by the up- and downregulation of distinct biological processes that can be followed through the expression level changes of associated genes and gene networks. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to establish a multiplex gene expression tracking platform to follow disease progression in an animal model facilitating the study of treatment paradigms. METHODS: We have established a multiplex platform covering 47 key genes related to immunological, neuronal, mitochondrial, and autophagy cell types and processes that capture disease progression in the 5xFAD mouse model. RESULTS: We show that the immunological response is the most pronounced change in aged 5xFAD mice (8 months and above), and in agreement with early stage human disease samples, observe an initial downregulation of microglial genes in one-month-old animals. The less dramatic downregulation of neuronal and mitochondrial gene sets is also reported.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to define the optimal electroencephalogram (EEG) settings for reliable detection of epileptiform discharges in AD patients. METHODS: We analyzed 24-h EEGs of 5 patients living with AD and epilepsy. The sensitivity of various length EEGs in detecting epileptiform discharges in different periods of the day, the diurnal distribution of the discharges, and their relation to sleep-stages were calculated. RESULTS: Significant high correlation was identified between the sensitivity of EEG and the length of recordings (r = 0.972, p = 0.005). The sensitivity of a 30-min EEG-epoch recorded between 8:00 and 16:00 was 0.0375 compared to 0.7 between 0:00 and 8:00 (p = 0.005). The average sensitivity of an 8-h EEG-epoch was>/=0.8. 82% of epileptiform discharges occurred during sleep, mainly related to non-REM sleep (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: 8-h awake-, or 1-h sleep-EEG provide sufficient sensitivity in detecting epileptiform activity in AD. This needs to be considered in studies on AD-related epilepsy.

Investigations of CT methods reveal how numerous factors decrease active drug-placebo group differences and increase variance, thereby reducing power to reach statistical significance for outcome measure differences in AD CTs. Such factors include, amongst many, inaccuracy, imprecision, bias, failures to follow or lack of operational protocols for applying CT methods, inter-site variance, and lack of homogeneous sampling using disorder criteria. After a review of the literature and survey of a sample of AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) CTs, the authors question whether problems of human error preclude AD researchers from continuing their dependence on rated outcome measures for CTs. The authors propose that the realities of AD, especially a probable irreversible progression of neuropathology prior to onset of clinical symptoms or signs capable of differentiating persons at risk for AD from normal aged, require AD investigators and clinicians to privilege biomarkers and encourage their development as surrogate targets for preventive AD treatment developments, testing, and use in clinical practice.",,"['Becker, Robert E', 'Greig, Nigel H', 'Giacobini, Ezio']","['Becker RE', 'Greig NH', 'Giacobini E']","['Drug Design & Development Section, Laboratory of Neurosciences, Intramural Research Program, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, USA. rebecker2008@comcast.net']",['eng'],['Z01 AG000311-08/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Observer Variation', 'Patient Selection', 'Psychotropic Drugs/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Design', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3372084,['NIHMS239202'],2008/10/28 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/28 09:00'],"['2008/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3233/jad-2008-15213 [doi]'],ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2008 Oct;15(2):303-25. doi: 10.3233/jad-2008-15213.,,,,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Psychotropic Drugs)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, aluminum (Al) neurotoxicity was suggested after its discovery in the senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that represent the principal neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Al is omnipresent in everyday life and can enter the human body from several sources, most notably from drinking water and food consumption. The evidence supporting association from ingestion of Al from drinking water is somewhat stronger than for its ingestion from food. However, other elements present in drinking water, such as fluoride, copper, zinc, or iron could also have an effect on cognitive impairment or modify any Al neurotoxicity. Some epidemiological studies, but not all, suggested that silica could be protective against Al damage, because it reduces oral absorption of Al and/or enhances Al excretion. Some epidemiological investigations suggested an association between chronic exposure to Al and risk of AD, although this relationship falls short of all the criteria generally attributed to causation. Future studies need to be more rigorous to truly test the validity of previous findings and in doing so attempt to identify dose-response relationships between Al and AD risk which may provide new routes to disease-modifying treatment of AD or possibly some lifestyle modification, to supplement existing symptomatic approaches.",,"['Frisardi, Vincenza', 'Solfrizzi, Vincenzo', 'Capurso, Cristiano', 'Kehoe, Patrick G', 'Imbimbo, Bruno P', 'Santamato, Andrea', 'Dellegrazie, Flora', 'Seripa, Davide', 'Pilotto, Alberto', 'Capurso, Antonio', 'Panza, Francesco']","['Frisardi V', 'Solfrizzi V', 'Capurso C', 'Kehoe PG', 'Imbimbo BP', 'Santamato A', 'Dellegrazie F', 'Seripa D', 'Pilotto A', 'Capurso A', 'Panza F']","['Department of Geriatrics, Center for Aging Brain, University of Bari, Bari, Italy. eziafrisardi@yahoo.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Aluminum/*poisoning', '*Alzheimer Disease/chemically induced/epidemiology/therapy', 'Animals', 'Cognition Disorders/chemically induced', 'Diet/adverse effects', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Neurotoxins/*poisoning', 'Risk Factors']",,,2010/04/10 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2010/04/10 06:00'],"['2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['5M5874234RJ1H51T [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-2009-1340 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2010;20(1):17-30. doi: 10.3233/JAD-2009-1340.,,,,,,"['0 (Neurotoxins)', 'CPD4NFA903 (Aluminum)']",,,,,,96,,,,,,,,,,

This invitation was based on an assessment that she was one of the journal's top authors and a strong supporter of the concept that oxidative stress is a major contributor to several alterations observed in age-related conditions (sarcopenia, osteoporosis) and, more significantly, in brain aging suggesting a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of one of the most dramatic age-related diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD). Her first pioneering research was on the discovery of high level of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (OH8dG), a marker of oxidation in nucleic acids, in mitochondrial DNA isolated from cerebral cortex. This molecule increases progressively with aging and more in AD brain, supporting the hypothesis that oxidative stress, a condition of unbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and antioxidants, gives a strong contribution to the high incidence of AD in old age subjects. OH8dG also increases in peripheral lymphocyte from AD subjects, suggesting that AD is not only a cerebral but also a systemic disease. The role of antioxidants, particularly vitamin E and zinc, were also studied in longevity and in cognitive decline and dementia.

These effects are achieved through a distributed interplay of psychological functions with the immediate environment and local culture on the one hand, and dialogue on the other. The garden, a natural canvas created by man, shares with art the ability to foster an esthetic sense for which the perception can be measured by functional neurological imaging exploration. Art represents a mediator for the collaborative realization of distributed psychological functions between different individuals. Based on the hypothesis of an optimization of the therapeutic potential of a garden by a design adapted to the neuro-psycho-social and cultural specificities of its users combined with the thoughtful introduction of an artistic dimension, the ""art, memory and life"" healing garden was created at the University Hospital of Nancy as a prototype for persons with ADRD.

Biomarker information is increasingly being disclosed in research settings, and is moving toward clinical settings with the development of cheaper and non-invasive testing. Limited research has focused on the safety and psychological effects of disclosing biomarker results to cognitively unimpaired adults. However, less is known about how to ensure equitable access and robust counseling for decision-making before testing, and how to effectively provide long-term follow-up and risk management after testing. Using the framework of Huntington's disease, which is based on extensive experience with disclosing and managing risk for a progressive neurodegenerative condition, this article proposes a conceptual model of pre-disclosure, disclosure, and post-disclosure phases for AD biomarker testing.

A major impediment is the lack of data sets. METHODS: We used an innovative, rigorous approach, combining several existing tools with our own, to accurately assemble and call variants in 809 whole mitochondrial genomes. RESULTS: To help address this impediment, we prepared a data set that consists of 809 complete and annotated mitochondrial genomes with samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. These whole mitochondrial genomes include rich phenotyping, such as clinical, fluid biomarker, and imaging data, all of which is available through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative website. Genomes are cleaned, annotated, and prepared for analysis.

This barrier forms the first line of defense by prohibiting pathogens from crossing to the CNS. Aging and chronic exposure of the BBB to pathogens renders it permeable, and this may give rise to pathology in the CNS such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Researchers have linked pathogens associated with periodontitis to neuroinflammation and AD-like pathology in vivo and in vitro. Although the presence of periodontitis-associated bacteria has been linked to AD in several clinical studies as DNA and virulence factors were confirmed in brain samples of human AD subjects, the mechanism by which the bacteria traverse to the brain and potentially influences neuropathology is unknown. In this review, we present current knowledge about the association between periodontitis and AD, the mechanism whereby periodontal pathogens might provoke neuroinflammation and how periodontal pathogens could affect the BBB. We suggest future studies, with emphasis on the use of human in vitro models of cells associated with the BBB to unravel the pathway of entry for these bacteria to the CNS and to reveal the molecular and cellular pathways involved in initiating the AD-like pathology. In conclusion, evidence demonstrates that bacteria associated with periodontitis and their virulence factors are capable of inflecting damage to the BBB and have a role in giving rise to pathology similar to that found in AD.",,"['Kouki, Mhd Ammar', 'Pritchard, Anna Barlach', 'Alder, Jane Elizabeth', 'Crean, StJohn']","['Kouki MA', 'Pritchard AB', 'Alder JE', 'Crean S']","['Brain and Behaviour Centre, Faculty of Clinical and Biomedical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, UK.', 'Brain and Behaviour Centre, Faculty of Clinical and Biomedical Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, UK.', 'Brain and Behaviour Centre, Faculty of Clinical and Biomedical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, UK.', 'Brain and Behaviour Centre, Faculty of Clinical and Biomedical Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/blood/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/*metabolism', 'Brain/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', '*Periodontitis/complications/metabolism', '*Virulence Factors/blood']",,,2021/12/14 06:00,2022/03/03 06:00,['2021/12/13 13:11'],"['2021/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/13 13:11 [entrez]']","['JAD215103 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-215103 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2022;85(3):957-973. doi: 10.3233/JAD-215103.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'bacteria', 'blood-brain barrier', 'periodontitis', 'virulence factors']",,,,['0 (Virulence Factors)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is caused by overproduction of Abeta or, more frequently, by impaired clearance from brain. Clearance can be reduced by increased aggregation, defective degradation, disturbed balance of transport across the blood-brain barrier, or inefficient peripheral removal of the peptide. In recent years these mechanisms have become targets of pharmacological interventions. Although several compounds have been discarded on the grounds of limited clinical efficacy, all major clearance-related approaches still hold promise. Some drug candidates have advanced to Phase III trials including anti-Abeta antibodies, metal complexing agents, ginseng extracts, and intravenous immunoglobulins. Data are currently not available from these studies that might allow an evaluation of efficacy and safety. Phase II trials on active and passive immunization have demonstrated a striking discrepancy between significant neurobiological effects regarding the removal of Abeta deposits and minor clinical outcomes. This does not preclude the possibility that clearance-related strategies have the potential of saving neurons and synapses via reducing the levels of soluble and particularly toxic Abeta species in brain.

In this review, we summarize the current findings on retinal vascular changes such as retinopathy signs and changes in novel retinal vascular network parameters and retinal vascular caliber with dementia, cognitive dysfunction and cerebral small vessel disease, and discuss possible future research to further evaluate whether retinal vascular imaging might help to elucidate vascular mechanisms contributing to the development of AD and provide additional value in predicting who may be at risk of developing AD.",,"['Cheung, Carol Yim-Lui', 'Ong, Yi-Ting', 'Ikram, M Kamran', 'Chen, Christopher', 'Wong, Tien Yin']","['Cheung CY', 'Ong YT', 'Ikram MK', 'Chen C', 'Wong TY']","['Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore National Eye Centre, Singapore Department of Ophthalmology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore Memory Aging and Cognition Centre, National University Health System, Singapore.', 'Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore National Eye Centre, Singapore NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore National Eye Centre, Singapore Department of Ophthalmology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore Memory Aging and Cognition Centre, National University Health System, Singapore.', 'NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore Memory Aging and Cognition Centre, National University Health System, Singapore Department of Pharmacology, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore National Eye Centre, Singapore Department of Ophthalmology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*complications/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Retinal Diseases/*etiology', 'Retinal Vessels/*pathology']",,,2014/10/30 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2014/10/30 06:00'],"['2014/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['M4302PW43VN8356Q [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-141596 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2014;42 Suppl 4:S339-52. doi: 10.3233/JAD-141596.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'microcirculation', 'retina', 'retinal vascular changes', 'retinal vasculature', 'small vessel disease']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, research on visual hallucinations (VH), the most common type of hallucinations in AD, is limited. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cognitive and cerebral macrostructural and metabolic features associated with VH in AD. METHODS: Twenty-four AD patients with VH, 24 with no VH (NVH), and 24 cognitively normal (CN) matched controls were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Differences in regional gray matter (GM) volumes and cognitive performance were investigated with whole brain voxel-based morphometry analyses of MRI structural brain scans, and analyses of neuropsychological tests. Glucose metabolic changes were explored in a sub-sample of patients who had FDG-PET scans available. RESULTS: More severe visuoconstructive and attentional deficits were found in AD VH compared with NVH. GM atrophy and hypometabolism were detected in occipital and temporal areas in VH patients in comparison with CN. On the other hand, NVH patients had atrophy and hypometabolism mainly in temporal areas. No differences in GM volume and glucose metabolism were found in the direct comparison between AD VH and NVH. CONCLUSION: In addition to the pattern of brain abnormalities typical of AD, occipital alterations were observed in patients with VH compared with CN. More severe visuoconstructive and attentional deficits were found in AD VH when directly compared with NVH, and might contribute to the emergence of VH in AD.",,"['Pezzoli, Stefania', 'Manca, Riccardo', 'Cagnin, Annachiara', 'Venneri, Annalena']","['Pezzoli S', 'Manca R', 'Cagnin A', 'Venneri A']","['Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Brunel University London, London, UK.', 'Department of Neurosciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Padua Neuroscience Center (PNC), University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Brunel University London, London, UK.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['U01 AG024904/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CIHR/Canada']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['*Alzheimer Disease/complications/diagnostic imaging/metabolism', 'Atrophy/metabolism', 'Brain/pathology', 'Hallucinations/complications/etiology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Neuroimaging', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Positron-Emission Tomography']",,,2022/07/19 06:00,2022/09/09 06:00,['2022/07/18 04:24'],"['2022/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2022/07/18 04:24 [entrez]']","['JAD215107 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-215107 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2022;89(1):133-149. doi: 10.3233/JAD-215107.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'FDG-PET', 'MRI', 'attention', 'neuropsychology', 'visual hallucinations', 'visuoconstruction']",,,,,"[""Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most cases of AD are sporadic and late-onset, and a complex interaction between genetic predisposition and vascular risk factors has been proposed. Vascular risk factors for AD include stroke, hypertension, diabetes, homocysteine, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, heart failure and atrial fibrillation; it is possible that these can trigger cerebrovascular dysfunction and AD pathology. Explanations for these associations include the coincidence of common disorders in the elderly where vascular and cerebrovascular disease can precipitate AD, implying that the onset of dementia disease is determined by a synergistic combination of risk factors. In this paper we review the role of cardiovascular risk factors in the pathogenesis of AD and discuss the associated brain mechanisms that can underlie the onset of AD.

Neurons are destroyed by this inflammatory process, leading to the cognitive deficits which define AD clinical onset. Epidemiological studies indicate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can ameliorate this destructive process if they are started well before clinical signs develop. Biomarker studies indicate that the disease process starts at least a decade before cognitive deficits appear. This pre-clinical onset explains the NSAID effect. It also opens a window of opportunity for preventive treatment that can be met with a simple diagnostic test. Salivary levels of Abeta42 may fulfill that need. They can be measured by a simple ELISA test we have developed using commercially available reagents.

Evidence shows that AD neuropathology occurs decades before clinical presentation. AD is divided into three stages: preclinical stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia. In the natural world, some animals, such as non-human primates (NHPs) and canines, can develop spontaneous AD-like dementia. However, most animals do not develop AD. With the development of transgenic techniques, both invertebrate and vertebrate animals have been employed to uncover the mechanisms of AD and study treatment methods. Most AD research focuses on early-onset familial AD (FAD) because FAD is associated with specific genetic mutations. However, there are no well-established late-onset sporadic AD (SAD) animal models because SAD is not directly linked to any genetic mutation, and multiple environmental factors are involved. Moreover, the widely used animal models are not able to sufficiently recapitulate the pathological events that occur in the MCI or preclinical stages.

These experiences provide guidance for the optimization of AD drug development. The ""rights"" of AD drug development include the right target, right drug, right biomarker, right participant, and right trial. The right target identifies the appropriate biologic process for an AD therapeutic intervention. The right drug must have well-understood pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features, ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, efficacy demonstrated in animals, maximum tolerated dose established in phase I, and acceptable toxicity. The right biomarkers include participant selection biomarkers, target engagement biomarkers, biomarkers supportive of disease modification, and biomarkers for side effect monitoring. The right participant hinges on the identification of the phase of AD (preclinical, prodromal, dementia). Severity of disease and drug mechanism both have a role in defining the right participant. The right trial is a well-conducted trial with appropriate clinical and biomarker outcomes collected over an appropriate period of time, powered to detect a clinically meaningful drug-placebo difference, and anticipating variability introduced by globalization.

Little is known about which NPS clinicians report and whether their judgment aligns with proxy-based instruments. We used natural language processing (NLP) to classify NPS in electronic health records (EHRs) to estimate the reporting of NPS in symptomatic AD at the memory clinic according to clinicians. Next, we compared NPS as reported in EHRs and NPS reported by caregivers on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). METHODS: Two academic memory clinic cohorts were used: the Amsterdam UMC (n = 3001) and the Erasmus MC (n = 646). Patients included in these cohorts had MCI, AD dementia, or mixed AD/VaD dementia. Ten trained clinicians annotated 13 types of NPS in a randomly selected training set of n = 500 EHRs from the Amsterdam UMC cohort and in a test set of n = 250 EHRs from the Erasmus MC cohort. For each NPS, a generalized linear classifier was trained and internally and externally validated. Prevalence estimates of NPS were adjusted for the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of each classifier. Intra-individual comparison of the NPS classified in EHRs and NPS reported on the NPI were conducted in a subsample (59%). RESULTS: Internal validation performance of the classifiers was excellent (AUC range: 0.81-0.91), but external validation performance decreased (AUC range: 0.51-0.93). NPS were prevalent in EHRs from the Amsterdam UMC, especially apathy (adjusted prevalence = 69.4%), anxiety (adjusted prevalence = 53.7%), aberrant motor behavior (adjusted prevalence = 47.5%), irritability (adjusted prevalence = 42.6%), and depression (adjusted prevalence = 38.5%). The ranking of NPS was similar for EHRs from the Erasmus MC, although not all classifiers obtained valid prevalence estimates due to low specificity. In both cohorts, there was minimal agreement between NPS classified in the EHRs and NPS reported on the NPI (all kappa coefficients < 0.28), with substantially more reports of NPS in EHRs than on NPI assessments. CONCLUSIONS: NLP classifiers performed well in detecting a wide range of NPS in EHRs of patients with symptomatic AD visiting the memory clinic and showed that clinicians frequently reported NPS in these EHRs. Clinicians generally reported more NPS in EHRs than caregivers reported on the NPI.",['(c) 2023.

Among the elderly, AD shortens life expectancy, results in disability, decreases quality of life, and ultimately, leads to institutionalization. Despite extensive research in the last few decades, its heterogeneous pathophysiology and etiopathogenesis have made it difficult to develop an effective treatment and prevention strategy. Aging is the biggest risk factor for AD and evidence suggest that the total number of older people in the population is going to increase astronomically in the next decades. Also, there is evidence that air pollution and increasing income inequality may result in higher incidence and prevalence of AD. This makes the need for a comprehensive understanding of the etiopathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disease extremely critical.

Although AD and SCZ partially overlap in terms of psychiatric symptoms and some aspects of cognitive impairment, the causal relationship between AD and SCZ is unclear. Based on the similarity of APs with yeast prion in terms of stress-induced protein aggregation, we recently proposed that evolvability of APs might be an epigenetic phenomenon to transmit stress information of parental brain to cope with the stressors in offspring. Although amyloid evolvability may be beneficial in evolution, AD might be manifested during parental aging as the mechanism of antagonistic pleiotropy phenomenon. Provided that accumulating evidence implicates stress as an important factor in SCZ, the main objective of this paper is to better understand the possible connection of AD and SCZ through amyloid evolvability. Hypothetically, the delivery of information of stress by APs may be less efficient under the decreased evolvability conditions such as disease-modifying treatment, leading to SCZ in offspring. Conversely, the increased evolvability conditions including gene mutations of APs are supposed to be beneficial for offspring, but might lead to AD in parents. Collectively, AD and SCZ might transgenerationally interfere with each other through amyloid evolvability, and this could explain why both AD and SCZ have not been selected out through evolution.",,"['Takamatsu, Yoshiki', 'Ho, Gilbert', 'Waragai, Masaaki', 'Wada, Ryoko', 'Sugama, Shuei', 'Takenouchi, Takato', 'Masliah, Eliezer', 'Hashimoto, Makoto']","['Takamatsu Y', 'Ho G', 'Waragai M', 'Wada R', 'Sugama S', 'Takenouchi T', 'Masliah E', 'Hashimoto M']","['Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'PCND Neuroscience Research Institute, Poway, CA, USA.', 'Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Physiology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Division of Neurosciences, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Amyloidogenic Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Brain/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Schizophrenia/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",PMC6484278,,2019/02/12 06:00,2020/07/23 06:00,['2019/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['JAD180986 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-180986 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2019;68(2):473-481. doi: 10.3233/JAD-180986.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'amyloid-beta', 'antagonistic pleiotropy', 'disease-modifying therapy', 'evolvability', 'natural selection', 'schizophrenia', 'transgenerational']","[""Authors' disclosures available online"", '(https://www.j-alz.com/manuscript-disclosures/18-0986r1).']",,,['0 (Amyloidogenic Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, studies of serum catD in AD have yielded conflicting results, and potential associations between baseline serum catD and functional outcomes of patients are at present unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the status of serum catD in a Singapore-based longitudinal study of dementia and investigate catD associations with functional and cognitive decline. METHODS: 35 subjects with no cognitive impairment, 40 patients with cognitive impairment no dementia and 34 with AD dementia underwent annual neuropsychological assessments (mean follow-up=4.3 years), as well as collection of baseline serum for catD measurements by ELISA. RESULTS: Higher serum catD at baseline was associated with AD clinical diagnosis (odds ratios [OR]: 10.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-97.95) as well as with cortical atrophy. Furthermore, higher catD was associated with global cognitive and functional decline (OR: 9.94; 95% CI: 1.02-97.34). CONCLUSION: The associations of serum catD with AD dementia as well as atrophy provide further support for the proposed links between catD and neurodegeneration, as well as for the assessment of serum catD as a prognostic biomarker predicting global cognitive and functional decline in larger studies.",,"['Chai, Yuek Ling', 'Liang, Nathan Hao Ping', 'Chong, Joyce R', 'Venketasubramanian, Narayanaswamy', 'Tan, Boon Yeow', 'Hilal, Saima', 'Chen, Christopher P', 'Lai, Mitchell K P']","['Chai YL', 'Liang NHP', 'Chong JR', 'Venketasubramanian N', 'Tan BY', 'Hilal S', 'Chen CP', 'Lai MKP']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge, Singapore.', 'Memory, Aging and Cognition Centre, National University Health Systems, Kent Ridge, Singapore.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge, Singapore.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge, Singapore.', 'Memory, Aging and Cognition Centre, National University Health Systems, Kent Ridge, Singapore.', 'Raffles Neuroscience Centre, Raffles Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', ""St Luke's Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."", 'Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge, Singapore.', 'Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge, Singapore.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge, Singapore.', 'Memory, Aging and Cognition Centre, National University Health Systems, Kent Ridge, Singapore.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge, Singapore.', 'Memory, Aging and Cognition Centre, National University Health Systems, Kent Ridge, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,IM,"['Humans', '*Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/psychology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Cathepsin D', '*Cognitive Dysfunction/psychology', 'Biomarkers', 'Atrophy']",,,2022/12/25 06:00,2023/02/08 06:00,['2022/12/24 04:23'],"['2022/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/02/08 06:00 [medline]', '2022/12/24 04:23 [entrez]']","['JAD220852 [pii]', '10.3233/JAD-220852 [doi]']",ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2023;91(3):989-998. doi: 10.3233/JAD-220852.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'brain atrophy', 'cathepsin D', 'cognitive decline', 'lysosomal protease', 'neurodegeneration']",,,,"['EC 3.4.23.5 (Cathepsin D)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that when caregivers' speech is perceived to be respectful, caring, not controlling, and/or it ascribes competence to their spouses, it would be associated with more effective communication.

Given this public health challenge, and that the current approved therapy for AD is limited to symptomatic treatment (i.e., cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists), exploration of new molecular pathways as novel therapeutic targets remains an attractive option for disease modifying drug development. microRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA that control gene expression at the post-translational level by inhibiting translation of specific mRNAs or degrading them. Dysregulation of several miRNAs has been described in AD brains. Interestingly, their molecular targets are pathways that are well-established functional players in the onset and development of AD pathogenesis.
