It is caused by any of the 4 serotypes of dengue virus and is transmitted within humans through female Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue disease varies from mild fever to severe conditions of dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. Globalization, increased air travel, and unplanned urbanization have led to increase in the rate of infection and helped dengue to expand its geographic and demographic distribution. Dengue vaccine development has been a challenging task due to the existence of four antigenically distinct dengue virus serotypes, each capable of eliciting cross-reactive and disease-enhancing antibody response against the remaining three serotypes. Recently, Sanofi Pasteur's chimeric live-attenuated dengue vaccine candidate has been approved in Mexico, Brazil, and Philippines for usage in adults between 9 and 45 years of age. The impact of its limited application to the public health system needs to be evaluated. Simultaneously, the restricted application of this vaccine candidate warrants continued efforts in developing a dengue vaccine candidate which is additionally efficacious for infants and naive individuals. In this context, alternative strategies of developing a designed vaccine candidate which does not allow production of enhancing antibodies should be explored, as it may expand the umbrella of efficacy to include infants and naive individuals.","['Khetarpal, Niyati', 'Khanna, Ira']","['Khetarpal N', 'Khanna I']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1848-0631'],"['International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi 110067, India; Department of Biochemistry, University of Delhi, Institute of Home Economics, Hauz Khas, New Delhi 110016, India.', 'International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi 110067, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160720,Egypt,J Immunol Res,Journal of immunology research,101627166,['0 (Dengue Vaccines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Dengue Vaccines/classification/genetics/immunology', 'Dengue Virus/*physiology', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care']",PMC4971387,2016/08/16 06:00,2017/03/07 06:00,['2016/08/16 06:00'],"['2016/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2016/6803098 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol Res. 2016;2016:6803098. doi: 10.1155/2016/6803098.

In 1998 this mosquito-borne disease is the most important tropical infectious disease after malaria, with an estimated 100 million cases of dengue fever, 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever, and 25,000 deaths annually. The reasons for this resurgence and emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the waning years of the 20th century are complex and not fully understood, but demographic, societal, and public health infrastructure changes in the past 30 years have contributed greatly. This paper reviews the changing epidemiology of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever by geographic region, the natural history and transmission cycles, clinical diagnosis of both dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever, serologic and virologic laboratory diagnoses, pathogenesis, surveillance, prevention, and control.

It is the most common arboviral disease worldwide, with the greatest burden in tropical and sub-tropical regions. In the absence of effective prevention and control measures, dengue is projected to increase in both disease burden and geographic range. Given its increasing importance as an etiology of fever in the returning traveler or the possibility of local transmission in regions in the United States with competent vectors, as well as the risk for large outbreaks in endemic US territories and associated states, clinicians should understand its clinical presentation and be familiar with appropriate testing, triage, and management of patients with dengue.

Dengvaxia is the first vaccine against dengue to be recommended for use in the United States and one of the first to require laboratory testing of potential recipients to be eligible for vaccination.

RECENT FINDINGS: Include recognition of the four different serotypes of DENV and their epidemiology as well as recognition of the expanded dengue syndrome encompassing multisystem involvement in the severe form of the disease including involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). DENV is a neurotropic virus with the ability to infect the supporting cells of the CNS. Neural injury during the acute stage of the infection results from direct neuro-invasion and/or the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement, resulting in plasma leakage and coagulopathy. Immune mechanisms have been implicated in the development of the delayed neurological sequelae through molecular mimicry. A myriad of neurological syndromes has been described as a result of the involvement of the CNS, the peripheral nervous system (PNS), or both. Neurological manifestations in DENV infection are increasingly being recognized, some of which are potentially fatal if not treated promptly. DENV encephalopathy and encephalitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of other acute febrile encephalopathies, autoimmune encephalitides, and in cases of encephalopathy/encephalitis related to SARS-CoV2 infection, especially in dengue-endemic areas. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) may be occasionally encountered. Clinicians should be knowledgeable of the expanded dengue syndrome characterized by the concurrent compromise of cardiac, neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, and hematopopoietic systems. Isolated cranial nerve palsies occur rather uncommonly and are often steroid responsive. These neuropathies may result from the direct involvement of cranial nerve nuclei or nerve involvement or may be immune-mediated. Even if the diagnosis of dengue is confirmed, it is absolutely imperative to exclude other well-known causes of isolated cranial nerve palsies. Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes may occur following dengue fever. The pathogenesis may be beyond the commonly observed thrombocytopenia and include cerebral vasculitis. Involvement of ocular blood vessels may cause maculopathy or retinal hemorrhages. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is uncommon and possibly related to dysregulated cytokine release phenomena. Lastly, any patient developing acute neuromuscular weakness during the course or within a fortnight of remission from dengue fever must be screened for acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), hypokalemic paralysis, or acute myositis. Rarely, a Miller-Fisher-like syndrome with negative anti-GQ1b antibody may develop.","['Trivedi, Sweety', 'Chakravarty, Ambar']","['Trivedi S', 'Chakravarty A']",,"['Department of Neurology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Science, Lucknow, India.', 'Department of Neurology, Vivekananda Institute of Medical Science, Kolkata, India. saschakra@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20220621,United States,Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,Current neurology and neuroscience reports,100931790,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['*Brain Diseases', '*COVID-19', '*Dengue/complications/diagnosis/pathology', '*Encephalitis', 'Humans', '*Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome/complications', 'RNA, Viral', 'SARS-CoV-2']",PMC9210046,2022/06/22 06:00,2022/07/15 06:00,['2022/06/21 11:21'],"['2022/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/07/15 06:00 [medline]', '2022/06/21 11:21 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11910-022-01213-7 [pii]', '1213 [pii]', '10.1007/s11910-022-01213-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep. 2022 Aug;22(8):515-529. doi: 10.1007/s11910-022-01213-7.

Infants and children with secondary heterologous dengue infections are most at risk for severe dengue disease. Laboratory diagnosis of dengue can be established within five days of disease onset by direct detection of viral components in serum. After day five, serologic diagnosis provides indirect evidence of dengue. Currently, no effective antiviral agents are available to treat dengue infection. Therefore, treatment remains supportive, with emphasis on close hematological monitoring, recognition of warning signs of severe disease and fluid-replacement therapy and/or blood transfusions when required. Development of a dengue vaccine is considered a high public health priority. A safe and efficacious dengue vaccine would also be important for travelers.

This revised system was found out to have good sensitivity and negative predictive value but poor specificity as well as positive predictive value. METHODS: This retrospective study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital of Delhi, India to assess factors predicting the occurrence of severe dengue in children as per the revised classification. A total of 647 suspected dengue cases were admitted in the hospital in the year 2015. Detailed clinical and epidemiological data of 170 patients who were confirmed as dengue either by NS1 antigen test or by serology (Ig M positive) were recorded and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The number of laboratory-confirmed cases was 170 and included thirty (17.65%) dengue fever (DF), 106 (62.35%) dengue with warning signs (DWS) and 34 (20.0%) severe dengue (SD) patients. Regression analysis revealed that presence of vomiting, altered sensorium, shock, peri-orbital edema, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated urea and creatinine, decreased total protein and globulin were significantly associated with occurrence of severe disease. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The addition of clinical features (peri-orbital edema and splenomegaly); and laboratory findings (elevated urea and creatinine, decreased serum protein and globulin) might help improve the sensitivity and specificity of the revised WHO dengue classification in predicting severe dengue.","['Arora, Shilpa Khanna', 'Nandan, Devki', 'Sharma, Anu', 'Benerjee, Pronita', 'Singh, Dhirendra Pratap']","['Arora SK', 'Nandan D', 'Sharma A', 'Benerjee P', 'Singh DP']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, ABVIMS and Dr. RML Hospital, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, ABVIMS and Dr. RML Hospital, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, ABVIMS and Dr. RML Hospital, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, ABVIMS and Dr. RML Hospital, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, ABVIMS and Dr. RML Hospital, Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Vector Borne Dis,Journal of vector borne diseases,101212761,,IM,"['Child', '*Dengue/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Severe Dengue/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'World Health Organization']",,2022/04/07 06:00,2022/04/08 06:00,['2022/04/06 03:31'],"['2022/04/06 03:31 [entrez]', '2022/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['JVectorBorneDis_2021_58_4_329_318312 [pii]', '10.4103/0972-9062.318312 [doi]']",ppublish,J Vector Borne Dis. 2021 Oct-Dec;58(4):329-334. doi: 10.4103/0972-9062.318312.,4,,['NOTNLM'],"['Children', 'Dengue', 'Predictors', 'Severe', 'WHO 2009']",['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disease caused by dengue ranges from a relatively minor febrile illness to a life-threatening condition characterized by extensive capillary leak. A greater understanding of dengue has the potential to improve both the clinical management of individual cases and the control of the disease. SOURCES OF DATA: We searched the available literature using PubMed, Embase and Web of Science for relevant articles and abstracts. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Addressing our gaps in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and improving our knowledge of dengue virus biology are necessary in order to develop tools to effectively control, diagnose and treat the disease. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: The pathogenesis of dengue is multifactorial and depends on both host and virus factors. A more integrated understanding of disease pathogenesis is necessary. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: There are many questions related to disease pathogenesis, development of diagnostics, drug and vaccine development and individual case management that need addressing if the disease is to be successfully tackled.","['Whitehorn, James', 'Farrar, Jeremy']","['Whitehorn J', 'Farrar J']",,"['London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100708,England,Br Med Bull,British medical bulletin,0376542,['0 (Dengue Vaccines)'],IM,"['Dengue/pathology/*prevention & control/transmission', 'Dengue Vaccines/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Design', 'Humans']",,2010/07/10 06:00,2011/01/21 06:00,['2010/07/10 06:00'],"['2010/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['ldq019 [pii]', '10.1093/bmb/ldq019 [doi]']",ppublish,Br Med Bull. 2010;95:161-73. doi: 10.1093/bmb/ldq019.

Expert commentary: Dengue in the elderly is an increasingly important yet greatly understudied area. There is an urgent need to refine the current diagnostic criteria to improve diagnosis, classification of disease severity and identify individuals in this population who are likely to progress to severe disease.

RECENT FINDINGS: The year 2001 witnessed unprecedented global dengue epidemic activity in the American hemisphere, the Pacific islands and continental Asia. Early diagnosis of dengue is important but what is the value and appropriate use of the tourniquet test? A negative test does not rule out dengue infection, a positive test should be followed by close surveillance for early signs of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Low platelet counts do not predict clinically significant bleeding in dengue. It follows that platelet or blood transfusions should not be administered based upon platelet count alone. Dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome cases frequently have compensated consumptive coagulopathy that seldom requires treatment. Bleeding is most likely caused by activated platelets resulting from damaged capillary endothelium. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome can be safely treated with just normal saline. Colloids should be immediately given to children presenting with a pulse pressure at or below 10 mmHg. Human leukocyte antigen alleles correlate with both protection and susceptibility to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome; studies in Haiti suggest that blacks have a gene providing nearly complete protection against severe dengue illness. SUMMARY: The role that antibodies play in protecting and enhancing dengue infections has been largely ignored. Such studies require definitive knowledge of what cells are infected in human dengue and an understanding of all the early antibody-accessible steps of infection of these target cells.","['Halstead, Scott B']",['Halstead SB'],,"['Department of Preventive Medicine and Biometrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland 20852, USA. halsteads@erols.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Current opinion in infectious diseases,8809878,,IM,"['Dengue/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Dengue Virus/immunology/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Severe Dengue/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology']",,2003/04/11 05:00,2003/05/08 05:00,['2003/04/11 05:00'],"['2003/04/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/11 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001432-200210000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2002 Oct;15(5):471-6. doi: 10.1097/00001432-200210000-00003.,5,,,,,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unreported and unrecognised apparent dengue virus infections make it difficult to estimate the true extent of dengue and current estimates of the incidence and costs of dengue have substantial uncertainty. Objective, systematic, comparable measures of dengue burden are needed to track health progress, assess the application and financing of emerging preventive and control strategies, and inform health policy. We estimated the global economic burden of dengue by country and super-region (groups of epidemiologically similar countries). METHODS: We used the latest dengue incidence estimates from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 and several other data sources to assess the economic burden of symptomatic dengue cases in the 141 countries and territories with active dengue transmission. From the scientific literature and regressions, we estimated cases and costs by setting, including the non-medical setting, for all countries and territories. FINDINGS: Our global estimates suggest that in 2013 there were a total of 58.40 million symptomatic dengue virus infections (95% uncertainty interval [95% UI] 24 million-122 million), including 13 586 fatal cases (95% UI 4200-34 700), and that the total annual global cost of dengue illness was US$8.9 billion (95% UI 3.7 billion-19.7 billion). The global distribution of dengue cases is 18% admitted to hospital, 48% ambulatory, and 34% non-medical. INTERPRETATION: The global cost of dengue is substantial and, if control strategies could reduce dengue appreciably, billions of dollars could be saved globally. In estimating dengue costs by country and setting, this study contributes to the needs of policy makers, donors, developers, and researchers for economic assessments of dengue interventions, particularly with the licensure of the first dengue vaccine and promising developments in other technologies.

In this review, we discussed the epidemiology of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) as well as the disease's natural history, cycles of transmission, clinical diagnosis, aetiology, prevention, therapy, and management. A systematic literature search was done by databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar using search terms, 'dengue fever', 'symptoms and causes of dengue fever', 'dengue virus transmission', and 'strategies to control dengue'. We reviewed relevant literature to identify hazards related to DHF and the most recent recommendations for its management and prevention. Clinical signs and symptoms of dengue infection range from mild dengue fever (DF) to potentially lethal conditions like DHF or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Acute-onset high fever, muscle and joint pain, myalgia, a rash on the skin, hemorrhagic episodes, and circulatory shock are among the most common symptoms. An early diagnosis is vital to lower mortality. As dengue virus infections are self-limiting, but in tropical and subtropical areas, dengue infection has become a public health concern. Hence, developing and executing long-term control policies that can reduce the global burden of DHF is a major issue for public health specialists everywhere.","['Parveen, Shakeela', 'Riaz, Zainab', 'Saeed, Saba', 'Ishaque, Urwah', 'Sultana, Mehwish', 'Faiz, Zunaira', 'Shafqat, Zainab', 'Shabbir, Saman', 'Ashraf, Sana', 'Marium, Amna']","['Parveen S', 'Riaz Z', 'Saeed S', 'Ishaque U', 'Sultana M', 'Faiz Z', 'Shafqat Z', 'Shabbir S', 'Ashraf S', 'Marium A']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2486-6215'],"['Department of Zoology, The Government Sadiq College Women University, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan E-mail: drshakeela@gscwu.edu.pk.', 'Department of Zoology, The Government Sadiq College Women University, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan.', 'Department of Zoology, The Government Sadiq College Women University, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan.', 'Department of Zoology, The Government Sadiq College Women University, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan.', 'Department of Zoology, The Government Sadiq College Women University, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan.', 'Department of Zoology, The Government Sadiq College Women University, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan.', 'Department of Zoology, The Government Sadiq College Women University, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan.', 'Department of Zoology, The Government Sadiq College Women University, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan.', 'Department of Zoology, The Government Sadiq College Women University, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan.', 'Department of Zoology, The Government Sadiq College Women University, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,J Water Health,Journal of water and health,101185420,,IM,"['Humans', '*Severe Dengue/epidemiology/diagnosis', '*Dengue/epidemiology/diagnosis', '*Dengue Virus/physiology', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Public Health']",,2023/11/29 06:42,2023/11/30 06:44,['2023/11/29 00:17'],"['2023/11/30 06:44 [medline]', '2023/11/29 06:42 [pubmed]', '2023/11/29 00:17 [entrez]']",['10.2166/wh.2023.114 [doi]'],ppublish,J Water Health. 2023 Nov;21(11):1632-1650. doi: 10.2166/wh.2023.114.,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As dengue continues to spread in both endemic and new locations, dermatologists may have a larger role in the timely diagnosis and management of this disease.","['Braun, Mitchell', 'Andersen, Louise K', 'Norton, Scott A', 'Coates, Sarah J']","['Braun M', 'Andersen LK', 'Norton SA', 'Coates SJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9872-5602'],"['Department of Dermatology, The University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Aleris-Hamlet Private Hospital, Esbjerg, Denmark.', 'Departments of Dermatology and Preventive Medicine & Biometrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, The University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20230612,England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,,IM,"['Humans', '*Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Dermatologists', 'Europe', 'Climate Change', '*Exanthema']",,2023/06/12 13:07,2023/08/22 06:42,['2023/06/12 06:23'],"['2023/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2022/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2023/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/08/22 06:42 [medline]', '2023/06/12 13:07 [pubmed]', '2023/06/12 06:23 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijd.16739 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2023 Sep;62(9):1110-1120. doi: 10.1111/ijd.16739.

This review highlights important considerations for dengue disease in Africa, including epidemiology and underestimation of disease burden in African countries, issues with malaria misdiagnosis and co-infections, and potential evidence of genetic protection from severe dengue disease in populations of African descent. The findings indicate that dengue virus prevalence in African countries and populations may be more widespread than reported data suggests, and that the Aedes mosquito vectors appear to be increasing in dissemination and number. Changes in climate, population, and plastic pollution are expected to worsen the dengue situation in Africa. Dengue misdiagnosis is also a problem in Africa, especially due to the typical non-specific clinical presentation of dengue leading to misdiagnosis as malaria. Finally, research suggests that a protective genetic component against severe dengue exists in African descent populations, but further studies should be conducted to strengthen this association in various populations, taking into consideration socioeconomic factors that may contribute to these findings. The main takeaway is that Africa should not be overlooked when it comes to dengue, and more attention and resources should be devoted to this disease in Africa.","['Gainor, Emily Mary', 'Harris, Eva', 'LaBeaud, A Desiree']","['Gainor EM', 'Harris E', 'LaBeaud AD']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3148-682X'],"['Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-3370, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-3370, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20220125,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,,IM,"['Africa/epidemiology', 'Black People', 'Coinfection', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Endemic Diseases', 'Humans', 'Malaria/diagnosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Severe Dengue/epidemiology/genetics/prevention & control']",PMC8877195,2022/02/27 06:00,2022/03/17 06:00,['2022/02/26 01:06'],"['2021/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2022/01/15 00:00 [revised]', '2022/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/02/26 01:06 [entrez]', '2022/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['v14020233 [pii]', 'viruses-14-00233 [pii]', '10.3390/v14020233 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2022 Jan 25;14(2):233. doi: 10.3390/v14020233.,2,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aedes', 'Africa', 'ancestry', 'climate change', 'coinfection', 'dengue', 'epidemiology', 'misdiagnosis', 'mosquitoes', 'outbreaks']","['The authors declare no conflict of interest.

With no prophylactic vaccine or specific therapeutics available, vector control remains the best alternative to restrain its circulation. Moreover, the establishment of thriving vector populations in peri urban environments brings humans and viruses together, opening the possibility for the occurrence of unexpected outbreaks.

RECENT FINDINGS: Findings from 30 studies on historical health estimates, with the majority of the studies conducted in Asia, emphasized the importance of temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity, as well as lag effects, when trying to understand how climate change can impact the risk of contracting dengue. Furthermore, 35 studies presented findings on future health risk based upon climate projection scenarios, with a third of them showcasing global level estimates and findings across the articles emphasizing the need to understand risk at a localized level as the impacts from climate change will be experienced inequitably across different geographies in the future. Dengue is one of the most rapidly spreading viral diseases in the world, with ~390 million people infected worldwide annually. Several factors have contributed towards its proliferation, including climate change. Multiple studies have previously been conducted examining the relationship between dengue and climate change, both from a historical and a future risk perspective. We searched the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health (NIEHS) Climate Change and Health Portal for literature (spanning January 2007 to September 2019) providing historical and future health risk estimates of contracting dengue infection in relation to climate variables worldwide. With an overview of the evidence of the historical and future health risk posed by dengue from climate change across different regions of the world, this review article enables the research and policy community to understand where the knowledge gaps are and what areas need to be addressed in order to implement localized adaptation measures to mitigate the health risks posed by future dengue infection.","['Soneja, Sutyajeet', 'Tsarouchi, Gina', 'Lumbroso, Darren', 'Tung, Dao Khanh']","['Soneja S', 'Tsarouchi G', 'Lumbroso D', 'Tung DK']",,"['United Nations Development Programme, Vietnam Office, Washington, DC, USA.', 'HR Wallingford, Howbery Park, Wallingford, Oxfordshire, OX10 8BA, UK.

However, little has been published on international dengue vaccine communication and advocacy. More effort at the international level is required to review, unify and strategically disseminate dengue vaccine knowledge to endemic countries' decision makers and potential donors. Waiting to plan for the introduction of new vaccines until licensure may delay access in developing countries. Concerted efforts to communicate and advocate for vaccines prior to licensure are likely challenged by unknowns of the use of dengue vaccines and the disease, including uncertainties of vaccine impact, vaccine access and dengue's complex pathogenesis and epidemiology. Nevertheless, the international community has the opportunity to apply previous best practices for vaccine communication and advocacy. The following key strategies will strengthen international dengue vaccine communication and advocacy: consolidating existing coalitions under one strategic umbrella, urgently convening stakeholders to formulate the roadmap for integrated dengue prevention and control, and improving the dissemination of dengue scientific knowledge.","['Carvalho, Ana', 'Van Roy, Rebecca', 'Andrus, Jon']","['Carvalho A', 'Van Roy R', 'Andrus J']",,"['a Sabin Vaccine Institute , Washington , DC , USA.', 'a Sabin Vaccine Institute , Washington , DC , USA.', 'a Sabin Vaccine Institute , Washington , DC , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Rev Vaccines,Expert review of vaccines,101155475,['0 (Dengue Vaccines)'],IM,"['Dengue/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Dengue Vaccines/*administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious/*prevention & control', 'Global Health', '*Health Communication', 'Humans']",,2016/02/09 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/02/09 06:00'],"['2016/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/14760584.2016.1152187 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Vaccines. 2016;15(4):539-45. doi: 10.1586/14760584.2016.1152187.,4,,['NOTNLM'],"['Dengue', 'advocacy', 'communication', 'decision making', 'dengue vaccine', 'dengue-endemic countries', 'framing', 'international communication and advocacy', 'social marketing', 'strategic communication', 'vaccine introduction', 'vaccines']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence, spectrum and outcome of dengue hepatitis. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients, who had hepatitis among those with dengue infection admitted to two tertiary care hospitals in western India from January 2016 to March 2021. Diagnosis of dengue infection was made by serology. Dengue hepatitis was diagnosed and the severity of dengue was categorized by standard criteria. RESULTS: Of 1664 patients admitted with dengue fever during the study period, 199 patients had hepatitis (i.e. incidence of dengue hepatitis was 11.9%). Of the 199 dengue hepatitis patients (age: 29 [13 - 80] years, median [range], 67% males), 100 patients (50%) had severe dengue, 73 (36%) had severe dengue hepatitis, 32 (16%) had dengue shock syndrome and eight (4%) had acute liver failure. Forty-five patients (23%) had acute lung injury and 32 (16%) had acute kidney injury. The dengue hepatitis patients were treated with standard medical care, including vital organ support, as needed-166 (83%) patients survived, while 33 patients (17%) died (cause of death: multi-organ failure: 24 patients, septic shock: nine patients). The presence of shock independently predicted mortality (odds ratio 6.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.2 - 34). Among patients with dengue hepatitis, mortality rate was higher in those with severe dengue (23%), dengue shock syndrome (47%), severe dengue hepatitis (24%) and acute liver failure (38%). CONCLUSION: In this large series of hospitalized patients with dengue infection, the incidence of dengue hepatitis was 11.9%. Among 199 dengue hepatitis, 17% died; multi-organ failure was the commonest cause for death and death rate was higher in patients with more severe disease. The presence of shock at presentation independently predicted mortality.","['Prajapati, Ritesh', 'Mehta, Rajiv', 'Kabrawala, Mayank', 'Nandwani, Subhash', 'Patel, Nisharg', 'Sethia, Mohit', 'Magnani, Kamlesh', 'Tandel, Raj', 'Kumar, Ashish']","['Prajapati R', 'Mehta R', 'Kabrawala M', 'Nandwani S', 'Patel N', 'Sethia M', 'Magnani K', 'Tandel R', 'Kumar A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8458-276X'],"['Department of Gastroenterology, Surat Institute of Digestive Sciences, Majura Gate, Ring Road, Surat, 395 002, India. riteshprajapati87@gmail.com.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Smt.

Severe dengue follows a secondary infection with a different virus serotype. The problem is truly global as it is endemic in over 100 countries. Severe dengue can be a life-threatening because of increased vascular permeability, resulting in leakage of fluid from the intravascular compartment to the extravascular space. When major bleeding does occur, it is almost invariably combined with profound shock since this, in combination with thrombocytopenia, hypoxia, and acidosis, can lead to multiple organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from Dengue. Commercial rapid tests and ELISA kits are freely available, ensuring early diagnosis. The basis of management of severe dengue is effective fluid replacement.

METHODS: A 2-day expert consensus meeting in La Habana/Cuba aimed to (1) share the experiences from Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) member states when applying D/SD, (2) present national and local data using D/SD, and (3) agree with the presented evidence on a list of recommendations for or against the use of D/SD for PAHO, and also globally. RESULTS: Eight key questions were discussed, concluding: (1) D/SD is useful describing disease progression because it considers the dynamic nature of the disease, (2) D/SD helps defining dengue cases correctly for clinical studies, because it defines more precisely disease severity and allows evaluating dynamically the progression of cases, (3) D/SD describes correctly all clinical forms of severe dengue. Further standards need to be developed regionally, especially related to severe organ involvement, (4) D/SD allows for pathophysiological research identifying - in a sequential manner - the clinical manifestations of dengue related to pathophysiological events, (5) the warning signs help identifying early cases at risk of shock (children and adults), pathophysiology of the warning signs deserves further studies, (6) D/SD helps treating individual dengue cases and also the reorganization of health-care services for outbreak management, (7) D/SD helps diagnosing dengue, in presumptive diagnosis and follow-up of the disease, because of its high sensitivity and high negative predictive value (NPV), and (8) there is currently no update of the International Disease Classification10 (ICD10) to include the new classification of dengue (D/SD); therefore, there are not enough experiences of epidemiological reporting. Once D/SD has been implemented in epidemiological surveillance, D/SD allows to (1) identify severity of dengue cases in real time, for any decision-making on actions, (2) measure and compare morbidity and mortality in countries, and also globally, and (3) trigger contingency plans early, not only based on the number of reported cases but also on the reported severity of cases. CONCLUSION: The expert panel recommends to (1) update ICD10, (2) include D/SD in country epidemiological reports, and (3) implement studies improving sensitivity/specificity of the dengue case definition.","['Horstick, Olaf', 'Martinez, Eric', 'Guzman, Maria Guadalupe', 'Martin, Jose Luis San', 'Ranzinger, Silvia Runge']","['Horstick O', 'Martinez E', 'Guzman MG', 'Martin JL', 'Ranzinger SR']",,,['eng'],"['Consensus Development Conference', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150128,England,Pathog Glob Health,Pathogens and global health,101583421,,IM,"['Americas/epidemiology', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'World Health Organization']",PMC4445290,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/11/05 06:00,['2015/01/30 06:00'],"['2015/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['PGH-109-19 [pii]', '10.1179/2047773215Y.0000000003 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathog Glob Health. 2015 Feb;109(1):19-25. doi: 10.1179/2047773215Y.0000000003.

More than half of the global population lives in areas with risk of dengue transmission. Uncertainty in burden estimates, however, challenges policy makers' ability to set priorities, allocate resources, and plan for interventions. In this report, the first in a Series on dengue, we explore the estimations of disease and economic burdens of dengue, and the major estimation challenges, limitations, and sources of uncertainty. We also reflect on opportunities to remedy these deficiencies. Point estimates of apparent dengue infections vary widely, although the confidence intervals of these estimates overlap. Cost estimates include different items, are mostly based on a single year of data, use different monetary references, are calculated from different perspectives, and are difficult to compare. Comprehensive estimates that decompose the cost by different stakeholders (as proposed in our framework), that consider the cost of epidemic years, and that account for productivity and tourism losses, are scarce. On the basis of these estimates, we propose the most comprehensive framework for estimating the economic burden of dengue in any region, differentiated by four very different domains of cost items and by three potential stakeholders who bear the costs. This framework can inform future estimations of the economic burden of dengue and generate demand for additional routine administrative data collection, or for systematic incorporation of additional questions in nationally representative surveys in dengue-endemic countries. Furthermore, scholars could use the framework to guide scenario simulations that consider ranges of possible values for cost items for which data are not yet available. Results would be valuable to policy makers and would also raise awareness among communities, potentially improving dengue control efforts.","['Castro, Marcia C', 'Wilson, Mary E', 'Bloom, David E']","['Castro MC', 'Wilson ME', 'Bloom DE']",,"['Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.

Dengue infection with organ impairment mainly involves the central nervous system and the liver. Consistent hematological findings include vasculopathy, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. Laboratory diagnosis includes virus isolation, serology, and detection of dengue ribonucleic acid. Successful treatment, which is mainly supportive, depends on early recognition of the disease and careful monitoring for shock. A severity-based revised dengue classification for medical interventions has been developed and validated in many countries. There is no specific dengue treatment, and prevention is currently limited to vector control measures.

DHF is characterized by fever, bleeding diathesis and a tendency to develop a potentially fatal shock syndrome. Consistent hematological findings include vasculopathy, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. There are increasing reports of dengue infection with unusual manifestations that mainly involve cerebral and hepatic symptoms. Laboratory diagnosis includes virus isolation, serology, and detection of dengue ribonucleic acid. Successful treatment, which is mainly supportive, depends on early recognition of the disease and careful monitoring for shock. Prevention depends primarily on control of the mosquito vector.

OBJECTIVES: We assessed the economic cost and disease burden of dengue infections in Taiwan for the period 1998-2014, and compared these during epidemic and non-epidemic years. METHODS: We estimated the annual DALYs per million population using the disability weights for dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), dengue shock syndrome (DSS), and death cases. Economic costs were estimated and divided into direct (medical costs) and indirect costs (lost work days and caregiver fees). RESULTS: For the period 1998-2014, a mean of 115.3 (range: 6.3-934.3) DALYs per million population annually were lost to dengue. In epidemic years, direct costs associated with dengue resulted mostly from hospitalization (86.09%), emergency (7.77%), outpatient (6.10%), and drug costs (0.03%). For indirect costs, lost productivity due to death (70.76%) was the dominant contributor. Overall, the costs were 12.3 times higher in epidemic years than in non-epidemic years (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate the economic costs and disease burden of dengue infections for this period in Taiwan, and reveals significant differences in economic impact between epidemic and non-epidemic years.","['Luh, Dih-Ling', 'Liu, Cheng-Chieh', 'Luo, Yun-Ru', 'Chen, Szu-Chieh']","['Luh DL', 'Liu CC', 'Luo YR', 'Chen SC']",,"['Department of Public Health, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 40201, Taiwan, ROC; Department of Family and Community Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40201, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Public Health, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 40201, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Public Health, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 40201, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Public Health, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 40201, Taiwan, ROC; Department of Family and Community Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40201, Taiwan, ROC.

Given the difficulty in obtaining full reporting, the actual number of human infections is probably much higher than the number reported. Dengue is usually a nonspecific febrile illness that resolves with supportive therapy but the clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infection through severe hemorrhage and sudden fatal shock. The pathophysiology of the severe forms of dengue may be related to sequential infection with different serotypes, variations in virus virulence, interaction of the virus with environmental and host factors or a combination of these factors. Control of dengue at the present time is dependent on control of the principal vector mosquito, A. aegypti. Efforts to achieve such control are now focusing on community education and action towards eliminating this mosquito's breeding sites near human dwellings. Vaccine development continues, but at present the only way to avoid dengue in an area where it is endemic or epidemic is to use repellents and mosquito barriers. The movement of people to and from tropical areas makes dengue an important differential diagnosis in any patient with an acute illness and history of recent travel to tropical areas. Because of continued infestation of the southeastern United States with A. aegypti, indigenous transmission in the continental United States remains a public health concern.","['Hayes, E B', 'Gubler, D J']","['Hayes EB', 'Gubler DJ']",,"['Dengue Branch, Centers for Disease Control, Fort Collins, CO 80522.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,,IM,"['*Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'United States/epidemiology']",,1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006454-199204000-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 1992 Apr;11(4):311-7. doi: 10.1097/00006454-199204000-00010.,4,,,,,,,83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the main clinical, epidemiological and virological observations in the American region are presented and compared with those previously reported from Southeast Asia. During 2002, more than 30 Latin American countries reported over 1000000 DF cases. DHF occurred in 20 countries with more than 17000 DHF cases, including 225 fatalities. The co-circulation of multiple serotypes has been reported from many countries. In the Americas, DHF is observed both in children and adults; secondary infection by a different dengue virus serotype has been confirmed as an important risk factor for this severe form of the disease. However, some new risk factors such as the interval of dengue virus infections and the ethnicity and underlying chronic conditions of the patient have also been identified. The sequence of dengue virus infections and association with certain genotypes are further factors of importance. We also discuss the control and prevention strategies.

Differentiation between classic dengue fever (DF) and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) or severe dengue is a key aspect of dengue case classification. The geographic expansion of dengue and its increased incidence in older age groups have contributed to the limited applicability of the 1997 case definitions. Clinical experience of dengue suggests that the illness presents as a spectrum of disease instead of distinct phases. However, despite the rigid grouping of dengue into DF, DHF and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), overlap between the different manifestations has often been observed, which has affected clinical management and triage of patients. The findings of the DENCO study evaluating the 1997 case definitions formed the basis of the revised 2009 WHO case definitions, which classified the illness into dengue with and without warning signs and severe dengue. Although the revised scheme is more sensitive to the diagnosis of severe dengue, and beneficial to triage and case management, there remain issues with its applicability. It is considered by many to be too broad, requiring more specific definition of warning signs. Quantitative research into the predictive value of these warning signs on patient outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of the new classification system is required to ascertain whether the new classification system requires further modification, or whether elements of both classification systems can be combined.","['Hadinegoro, Sri Rezeki S']",['Hadinegoro SR'],,"['Department of Child Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia, Dr Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. srh3546@centrin.net.id']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Paediatr Int Child Health,Paediatrics and international child health,101582666,,IM,"['Dengue/*classification/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Humans', '*Severity of Illness Index', 'World Health Organization']",PMC3381438,2012/06/08 06:00,2012/10/17 06:00,['2012/06/07 06:00'],"['2012/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['50 [pii]', '10.1179/2046904712Z.00000000052 [doi]']",ppublish,Paediatr Int Child Health. 2012 May;32 Suppl 1(s1):33-8. doi: 10.1179/2046904712Z.00000000052.,s1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During this period, several patients were hospitalized at the Hospital Centre of Tahiti for neurological disorders occurring during a dengue fever. These events are not the typical picture, which is represented by a flu-like syndrome and sometimes, in severe cases, a haemorrhagic syndrome or shock. METHOD: We have established a review of the literature reporting the cases of dengue fever associated with neurological disorders with the terms ""dengue"" and ""neurology"". Despite the retrospective nature and incomplete data, we attempted to establish the epidemiological characteristics of these events, to give an order of frequency of these symptoms and the pathophysiological mechanisms involved. RESULTS: Among patients with neurological disorders occurring during a dengue fever, disorders of central nervous system are the most common. Among disorders of central nervous system, encephalopathy is by far the most encountered. CONCLUSION: None of observed neurologic disorders presenting with specific manifestation, discussion of dengue as etiology in endemic areas or in return from endemic area is well-founded.","['Oehler, Erwan', 'Le Henaff, Olivier', 'Ghawche, Frederic']","['Oehler E', 'Le Henaff O', 'Ghawche F']",,"['Centre hospitalier de Polynesie francaise, Papeete, 98713 Tahiti, Polynesie francaise, France. erwan.oehler@cht.pf']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20120424,France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,,IM,"['Age of Onset', 'Dengue/*complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Nervous System Diseases/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Phenotype', 'Polynesia/epidemiology', 'Prevalence']",,2012/04/27 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0755-4982(12)00202-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lpm.2012.03.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Presse Med. 2012 Oct;41(10):e547-52. doi: 10.1016/j.lpm.2012.03.010.

The disease is more prevalent in some parts of the country where rapid urbanisation has taken place. Diagnosis of DF/DHF is mainly done using the clinical features only due to the unavailability of laboratory diagnosis in many parts of the country and this might lead to over or under diagnosis of the disease. A rational diagnostic approach which combines the history and clinical profiles together with specific virological laboratory data would help in the correct identification of the disease. Furthermore, a feasible algorithm for the laboratory diagnosis of dengue will help to confirm the cases with a high level of clinical suspicion.

These viruses generally cause a benign syndrome, dengue fever, in the American and African tropics, and a severe syndrome, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), in Southeast Asian children. This severe syndrome, which recently has also been identified in children infected with the virus in Puerto Rico, is characterized by increased vascular permeability and abnormal hemostasis. It occurs in infants less than 1 year of age born to dengue-immune mothers and in children 1 year and older who are immune to one serotype of dengue virus and are experiencing infection with a second serotype. Dengue viruses replicate in cells of mononuclear phagocyte lineage, and subneutralizing concentrations of dengue antibody enhance dengue virus infection in these cells. This antibody-dependent enhancement of infection regulates dengue disease in human beings, although disease severity may also be controlled genetically, possibly by permitting and restricting the growth of virus in monocytes. Monoclonal antibodies show heterogeneous distribution of antigenic epitopes on dengue viruses. These epitopes serve to regulate disease: when antibodies to shared antigens partially neutralize heterotypic virus, infection and disease are dampened; enhancing antibodies alone result in heightened disease response. Further knowledge of the structure of dengue genomes should permit rapid advances in understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of dengue.","['Halstead, S B']",['Halstead SB'],,"['Division of Health Sciences, Rockefeller Foundation, New York, NY 10036.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Viral/physiology', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Asia, Southeastern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cuba', 'Dengue/epidemiology/ethnology/*etiology/immunology/microbiology/prevention & control', '*Dengue Virus/classification/genetics/immunology/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Puerto Rico', 'Serotyping']",,1988/01/29 00:00,1988/01/29 00:01,['1988/01/29 00:00'],"['1988/01/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/29 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.3277268 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1988 Jan 29;239(4839):476-81. doi: 10.1126/science.3277268.,4839,,,,,,,67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of symptomatic infections result in a relatively benign disease course. However, a small proportion of patients develop severe clinical manifestations, including bleeding, organ impairment, and endothelial dysfunction with increased capillary permeability causing hypovolaemic shock that can lead to cardiovascular collapse. Evidence is increasing that dengue can also cause myocardial impairment, arrhythmias and, occasionally, fulminant myocarditis. No antiviral agents or vaccines are licensed for dengue, and treatment remains supportive with judicious fluid replacement for patients with severe disease. Defining the role of cardiac dysfunction in the haemodynamic compromise of severe dengue has potentially important management implications. In this Review, we will outline the current understanding of the cardiovascular manifestations of dengue, including myocardial and vascular involvement, and conclude with a discussion of the available therapeutic options and potential future research directions.","['Yacoub, Sophie', 'Wertheim, Heiman', 'Simmons, Cameron P', 'Screaton, Gavin', 'Wills, Bridget']","['Yacoub S', 'Wertheim H', 'Simmons CP', 'Screaton G', 'Wills B']",,"['Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, 78 Giai Phong Street, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, 78 Giai Phong Street, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Hospital for Tropical Diseases, 764 Vo Van Kiet Street, Ward 1, District 5, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Department of Medicine, Imperial College, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Hospital for Tropical Diseases, 764 Vo Van Kiet Street, Ward 1, District 5, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140408,England,Nat Rev Cardiol,Nature reviews.

However, it is unclear how widespread it is in nature, and its importance in the epidemiology of this disease is still debated. Here, we review the literature on vertical transmission and discuss its role in dengue's epidemiology and control. We conclude that given the number of studies that failed to find evidence of vertical transmission, as well as mathematical models and its mechanistic basis, it is unlikely that vertical transmission is important for the epidemiological persistence of dengue viruses. A combination of asymptomatic infection in humans and movement of people are likely to be more important determinants of dengue's persistence. We argue, however, that there may be some need for further research into the prevalence of dengue viruses in desiccated, as well as diapausing, eggs and the role of horizontal transmission through larval cannibalism.","['Grunnill, Martin', 'Boots, Michael']","['Grunnill M', 'Boots M']",,"['Centre for Ecology and Conservation Biosciences, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus, Treliever Road, Penryn, Cornwall TR10 9FE, United Kingdom (mdg206@exeter.ac.uk), mg206@exeter.ac.uk.', 'Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America (mboots@berkeley.edu).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151105,England,J Med Entomol,Journal of medical entomology,0375400,,IM,"['Aedes/*virology', 'Animals', 'Dengue/*transmission', 'Diapause, Insect', 'Humans', '*Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Insect Vectors/*virology', 'Ovum/virology']",,2015/11/08 06:00,2016/04/22 06:00,['2015/11/08 06:00'],"['2015/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['tjv168 [pii]', '10.1093/jme/tjv168 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Entomol. 2016 Jan;53(1):1-19. doi: 10.1093/jme/tjv168.

As one of the world's most popular tourist destinations, Bali is regularly visited by domestic and international travellers, who are prone to infection by endemic pathogens, including DENV. Currently, limited data are available on the characteristics of dengue in travellers visiting Bali. Information on the epidemiology and virological aspects of dengue in these tourists is important to gain a better understanding of the dengue disease in international travellers. METHODS: We performed a prospective cross-sectional dengue study involving foreign travellers visiting Bali, Indonesia in the period of 2015-17. Patients presenting at Kasih Ibu Hospital with fever and clinical symptoms of dengue were asked to participate in the study. Clinical and laboratory assessments were performed and sera were collected for molecular analysis, which included DENV serotyping, genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Among the 201 patients recruited, dengue was confirmed in 133 (66.2%) of them, based on detection of NS1 antigen and/or viral RNA. Of these, 115 (86.5%) manifested dengue fever (DF) and 18 (13.5%) dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). The temporal predominance of infecting DENV serotype was DENV-2 (48.7%), followed by DENV-3 (36.1%), DENV-1 (9.2%) and DENV-4 (3.4%). Phylogenetic analysis of DENV based on envelope gene sequences revealed that the source of DENVs was local endemic viruses. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that dengue is one of the causes of fever in travellers visiting Bali. Although it is a cause of significant morbidity, the majority of patients only experienced mild DF, with only a small proportion developing DHF. We revealed that DENVs isolated were autochthonous. Accurate diagnosis, preventive measures and continuous disease surveillance will be useful for better management of dengue infection in travellers.","['Masyeni, Sri', 'Yohan, Benediktus', 'Somia, I Ketut Agus', 'Myint, Khin S A', 'Sasmono, R Tedjo']","['Masyeni S', 'Yohan B', 'Somia IKA', 'Myint KSA', 'Sasmono RT']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Warmadewa University, Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia.', 'Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology, Jakarta, Indonesia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Udayana University, Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia.', 'Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology, Jakarta, Indonesia.', 'Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology, Jakarta, Indonesia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Travel Med,Journal of travel medicine,9434456,,IM,"['Adult', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/therapy/virology', 'Dengue Virus/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indonesia', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', '*Travel', '*Travel-Related Illness']",PMC6118167,2018/08/17 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/08/17 06:00'],"['2018/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['5065180 [pii]', 'tay061 [pii]', '10.1093/jtm/tay061 [doi]']",ppublish,J Travel Med. 2018 Aug 1;25(1):tay061. doi: 10.1093/jtm/tay061.,1,,,,,,['U18 CK000443/CK/NCEZID CDC HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infection by one of the four serotypes of dengue virus induces a spectrum of disease manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening Dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Many efforts have been made to elucidate several aspects of dengue virus-induced disease, but the pathogenesis of disease is complex and remains unclear. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the early stages of infection is crucial to determine and develop safe therapeutics to prevent the severe outcomes of disease without interfering with control of infection. In this review, we discuss the dual role of the innate and inflammatory pathways activated during dengue disease in mediating both protection and exacerbation of disease. We show that some mediators involved in each of these responses differ substantially, suggesting that interfering in disease-associated immune pathways may represent a potential therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of severe dengue.","['Costa, Vivian Vasconcelos', 'Fagundes, Caio Tavares', 'Souza, Danielle G', 'Teixeira, Mauro Martins']","['Costa VV', 'Fagundes CT', 'Souza DG', 'Teixeira MM']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, Institute of Biological Sciences, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130406,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Dengue/complications/*immunology/physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Inflammation/*virology', 'Mice']",,2013/04/10 06:00,2013/11/06 06:00,['2013/04/10 06:00'],"['2012/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-9440(13)00206-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.02.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2013 Jun;182(6):1950-61. doi: 10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.02.027.

As it is spreading from tropical and subtropical zones, some regions previously recognised as non-endemic are at risk of becoming endemic. However, the global circulation of dengue is not fully understood and quantitative measurements of endemicity levels are lacking, posing an obstacle in the precise control of dengue spread. In this study, a sequence-based pipeline was designed based on random sampling to study the transmission of dengue. The limited intercontinental transmission was identified, while regional circulation of dengue was quantified in terms of importation, local circulation and exportation. Additionally, hypo- and hyper-endemic regions were identified using a new metric, with the former characterised by low local circulation and increased importation, whereas the latter by high local circulation and reduced importation. In this study, the global circulation pattern of dengue was examined and a sequence-based endemicity measurement was proposed, which will be helpful for future surveillance and targeted control of dengue.","['Long, Haoyu', 'Zhang, Chi', 'Chen, Cai', 'Tang, Jing', 'Zhang, Bing', 'Wang, Yinghan', 'Pang, Jiali', 'Su, Wenzhe', 'Li, Kuibiao', 'Di, Biao', 'Chen, Yao-Qing', 'Shu, Yuelong', 'Du, Xiangjun']","['Long H', 'Zhang C', 'Chen C', 'Tang J', 'Zhang B', 'Wang Y', 'Pang J', 'Su W', 'Li K', 'Di B', 'Chen YQ', 'Shu Y', 'Du X']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8184-8430'],"['School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210710,Germany,Transbound Emerg Dis,Transboundary and emerging diseases,101319538,,IM,"['Animals', '*Dengue/epidemiology/prevention & control/veterinary', '*Dengue Virus', 'Humans', 'Public Health']",,2021/07/02 06:00,2022/07/22 06:00,['2021/07/01 17:32'],"['2021/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/01 17:32 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tbed.14211 [doi]'],ppublish,Transbound Emerg Dis. 2022 Jul;69(4):2148-2155. doi: 10.1111/tbed.14211.

There is wide variation and substantial uncertainty in current estimates of dengue disease burden and, consequently, on economic burden estimates. Dengue disease varies across time, geography and persons affected. Variations in the transmission of four different viruses and interactions among vector density and host's immune status, age, pre-existing medical conditions, all contribute to the disease's complexity. This systematic review aims to identify and examine estimates of dengue disease burden and costs, discuss major sources of uncertainty, and suggest next steps to improve estimates. Economic analysis of dengue is mainly concerned with costs of illness, particularly in estimating total episodes of symptomatic dengue. However, national dengue disease reporting systems show a great diversity in design and implementation, hindering accurate global estimates of dengue episodes and country comparisons. A combination of immediate, short-, and long-term strategies could substantially improve estimates of disease and, consequently, of economic burden of dengue. Suggestions for immediate implementation include refining analysis of currently available data to adjust reported episodes and expanding data collection in empirical studies, such as documenting the number of ambulatory visits before and after hospitalization and including breakdowns by age. Short-term recommendations include merging multiple data sources, such as cohort and surveillance data to evaluate the accuracy of reporting rates (by health sector, treatment, severity, etc.), and using covariates to extrapolate dengue incidence to locations with no or limited reporting. Long-term efforts aim at strengthening capacity to document dengue transmission using serological methods to systematically analyze and relate to epidemiologic data. As promising tools for diagnosis, vaccination, vector control, and treatment are being developed, these recommended steps should improve objective, systematic measures of dengue burden to strengthen health policy decisions.","['Shepard, Donald S', 'Undurraga, Eduardo A', 'Betancourt-Cravioto, Miguel', 'Guzman, Maria G', 'Halstead, Scott B', 'Harris, Eva', 'Mudin, Rose Nani', 'Murray, Kristy O', 'Tapia-Conyer, Roberto', 'Gubler, Duane J']","['Shepard DS', 'Undurraga EA', 'Betancourt-Cravioto M', 'Guzman MG', 'Halstead SB', 'Harris E', 'Mudin RN', 'Murray KO', 'Tapia-Conyer R', 'Gubler DJ']",,"['Schneider Institutes for Health Policy, Heller School, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Schneider Institutes for Health Policy, Heller School, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Carlos Slim Health Institute, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Pedro Kouri Tropical Medicine Institute, Havana, Cuba.', 'Dengue Vaccine Initiative, Rockville, Maryland, United States of America.', 'University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.', 'Ministry of Health, Putrajaya, Malaysia.', ""Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, United States of America."", 'Carlos Slim Health Institute, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20141120,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Cost of Illness', 'Costs and Cost Analysis/methods', 'Dengue/*economics/*epidemiology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Global Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans']",PMC4238988,2014/11/21 06:00,2016/02/19 06:00,['2014/11/21 06:00'],"['2014/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['PNTD-D-14-00173 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0003306 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2014 Nov 20;8(11):e3306. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003306. eCollection 2014 Nov.,11,,,,"['This study was supported in part by a research agreement between Sanofi Pasteur', 'and Brandeis University.

Both infectious diseases pose a tremendous burden in these countries related to both infection control and the economy. Increases in the number of dengue cases occurred in part due to disruptions in the pathogen-host-vector relationship caused by changes in human behaviour in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of dengue was further aggravated by the implementation of lockdowns and social distancing policies. These measures limited the coverage of dengue preventive programs and delayed the medical management of both diseases due to co-infection and misdiagnosis. It is of the utmost importance for the population to remain aware of both diseases, and dengue vector control strategies must be devised to properly address outbreaks using digitalization and remote surveillance. Similarly, critical triage algorithms and further research are also needed to combat co-infection and misdiagnosis.

RECENT FINDINGS: Increasingly, there are more adult dengue patients who require intensive care. This may be due to a shift in epidemiology of dengue infection from mainly a pediatric disease toward adult disease. In addition, multiorgan dysfunction was observed to be a key risk factor for ICU admission and mortality. This may be due to older adults having preexisting comorbidities that potentially predispose to have multiple severe organ impairment. Interventions remain largely supportive but also require more evidence-based trials and treatment protocols. SUMMARY: These findings highlight the common clinical manifestations of adult dengue patients and the challenges of clinical management in ICU. Risk factors for prediction of adult dengue patients who require ICU are available, but they lack validation and consistent study design for meta-analysis in future. Early recognition of these risk factors, with close monitoring and prompt clinical management, remains critical to reduce mortality.","['Pang, Junxiong', 'Leo, Yee-Sin', 'Lye, David C']","['Pang J', 'Leo YS', 'Lye DC']",,"['aInstitute of Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology, Tan Tock Seng HospitalbSaw Swee Hock School of Public HealthcYong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of SingaporedLee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Crit Care,Current opinion in critical care,9504454,,IM,"['Adult', '*Critical Care', 'Dengue/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Intensive Care Units', 'Risk Factors']",,2016/09/02 06:00,2018/04/28 06:00,['2016/09/02 06:00'],"['2016/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['00075198-201610000-00012 [pii]', '10.1097/MCC.0000000000000339 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Crit Care. 2016 Oct;22(5):485-90. doi: 10.1097/MCC.0000000000000339.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It primarily infects people living in tropical and subtropical areas and can be transmitted vertically or horizontally to new-borns. We discuss the clinical spectrum, treatment, and outcomes of five neonates who presented with dengue fever at Aga Khan Hospital for Women in Karimabad, Karachi, Pakistan, during the 2021 post- monsoon season (October to December). Dengue infection was confirmed via positive NS1 antigen test. All new-borns had fever, flushing, and thrombocytopenia. Capillary leak syndrome and haemorrhagic complications occurred in one case. Two babies required oxygen support, with one mortality. Due to the severity of the disease in this population, we suggest that dengue fever should be evaluated as a differential diagnosis in neonates with sepsis and thrombocytopenia, especially in high-risk or endemic areas. Critical management strategies for neonatal dengue fever are the same as those for other paediatric patients and include judicious use of intravenous fluids and inotropes.","['Salim, Maliha', 'Kumar, Vinod', 'Zaheer, Hafsa', 'Shamim, Nazia', 'Hashmis, Hina Mumtaz']","['Salim M', 'Kumar V', 'Zaheer H', 'Shamim N', 'Hashmis HM']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Pakistan,J Pak Med Assoc,JPMA.

This study aimed to characterize the district-level spatial-temporal patterns of dengue in Thailand and explore if a dengue peak in Bangkok led the peaks of dengue in other Thai provinces. METHODS: Monthly dengue data at district level in Thailand from January 2004 to December 2017 were obtained and used to assess the spatial and seasonal patterns of dengue in Thailand. As our seasonal decomposition and cross-correlation analyses showed that dengue in Bangkok peaked in November, which was a few months after the dengue peak in most other provinces, we used a time-series generalized linear model to explore if there was another province in which the dengue case number was most predictive of dengue case numbers in other Thai provinces. RESULTS: The highest district-level annual dengue incidence rates (per 10,000) in the three time periods (i.e. 2004-2008, 2009-2013 and 2014-2017) were 58.08 (Samphanthawong), 85.93 (Mueang Krabi), and 66.60 (Mae Sariang), respectively. Dengue incidence rates in the western part of Northern Thailand, southern part of Central Thailand, southern part of Eastern Thailand, and Southern Thailand were higher than in other regions. Dengue in most districts of Thailand peaked in June, July or August, but dengue peaks in all districts of Bangkok occurred in November. The number of dengue cases in Nakhon Ratchasima was most predictive of the number of dengue cases in other provinces in Thailand by a one-month lag. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the dengue peak in Bangkok did not lead the peaks of dengue in other Thai provinces. Future research exploring how changes in socio-ecological factors (e.g. road network and climate factors) in Nakhon Ratchasima have affected the transmission of dengue in Thailand might shed some new light on the prevention and control of dengue.","['Xu, Zhiwei', 'Bambrick, Hilary', 'Pongsumpun, Puntani', 'Ming Tang, I', 'Yakob, Laith', 'Devine, Gregor', 'Frentiu, Francesca D', 'Williams, Gail', 'Hu, Wenbiao']","['Xu Z', 'Bambrick H', 'Pongsumpun P', 'Ming Tang I', 'Yakob L', 'Devine G', 'Frentiu FD', 'Williams G', 'Hu W']",,"['School of Public Health and Social Work, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, 4059, Australia.', 'Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, 4059, Australia.', 'School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, 4006, Australia.', 'School of Public Health and Social Work, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, 4059, Australia.', 'Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, 4059, Australia.', ""Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, 10520, Thailand."", ""Computational & Applied Science for Smart Innovation Cluster (CLASSIC), Faculty of Science, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, 10140, Thailand."", 'Department of Disease Control, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, WC1H 9SH, UK.', 'Mosquito Control Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, 4006, Australia.', 'Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, 4059, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, 4059, Australia.', 'School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, 4006, Australia.', 'School of Public Health and Social Work, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, 4059, Australia. w2.hu@qut.edu.au.', 'Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, 4059, Australia. w2.hu@qut.edu.au.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200113,England,Parasit Vectors,Parasites & vectors,101462774,,IM,"['Animals', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Seasons', 'Sociological Factors', 'Temperature', 'Thailand/epidemiology']",PMC6958813,2020/01/15 06:00,2020/05/15 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13071-020-3892-y [pii]', '3892 [pii]', '10.1186/s13071-020-3892-y [doi]']",epublish,Parasit Vectors. 2020 Jan 13;13(1):22. doi: 10.1186/s13071-020-3892-y.,1,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bangkok', 'Dengue', 'Nakhon Ratchasima', 'Thailand']",['The authors declare that they have no completing interests.'],,"['APP 1138622/National Health and Medical Research Council, Australia/']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Being an endemic country, Bangladesh has experienced the largest dengue epidemic in 2019. The present study aimed at evaluating the clinical and laboratory profile of dengue patients in northern Bangladesh during the epidemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 319 serologically confirmed dengue patients admitted in Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Medical College Hospital in Bogra district. It is one of the main tertiary care hospitals in northern Bangladesh. Data were collected from July to September 2019. Patients' clinical and laboratory data were extracted from clinical records. Patients were classified into two classes according to the WHO 2009 dengue classification such as (i) non-severe dengue and (ii) severe dengue. Chi-square test and independent t-test were used in this study. RESULTS: Of the 319 patients, 94.1% had non-severe dengue and the remaining 5.9% had severe dengue (severe plasma leakage 68.4%, severe organ involvement 68.4%, and severe clinical bleeding 10.5%). Most of the patients were suffering from primary dengue infection. The most common clinical presentation was fever followed by headache and myalgia. Vomiting and abdominal pain were the most prevalent warning signs. The common hematological findings on admission were leukopenia (63.3%), thrombocytopenia (30.4%) and increased hematocrit (26.6%). Raised serum ALT or AST was observed in 14.1% cases whereas raised serum creatinine was observed in 6.6% cases. Signs of plasma leakage (pleural effusion, respiratory distress, and ascites, rise of hematocrit >20% during hospital stay) and hepatic or renal involvement (serum ALT >42UI/L or serum creatinine >1.2 mg/dL) on admission were mostly associated with severe dengue. CONCLUSION: The study provides clinical evidence on presentation as well as hematological and biochemical profile of dengue patients in northern Bangladesh that should be implicated in effective patient management.","['Rafi, Abdur', 'Mousumi, Ashrafun Nahar', 'Ahmed, Reejvi', 'Chowdhury, Rezwanul Haque', 'Wadood, Abdul', 'Hossain, Golam']","['Rafi A', 'Mousumi AN', 'Ahmed R', 'Chowdhury RH', 'Wadood A', 'Hossain G']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5415-6399', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5506-6803', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3822-5489']","['Rajshahi Medical College, Rajshahi, Rajshahi, Bangladesh.', 'Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Medical College, Bogra, Bogra, Bangladesh.', 'Sir Salimullah Medical College, Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'Rangpur Medical College, Rangpur, Rangpur, Bangladesh.', 'Medical Centre, University of Rajshahi, Rajshahi, Bangladesh.', 'Health Research Group, Department of Statistics, University of Rajshahi, Rajshahi, Bangladesh.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201013,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bangladesh/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dengue/*classification/*diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Dengue Virus/isolation & purification', 'Epidemics', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Severe Dengue/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Severity of Illness Index']",PMC7553334,2020/10/14 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/10/13 17:11'],"['2020/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/13 17:11 [entrez]', '2020/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['PNTD-D-20-00595 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0008567 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2020 Oct 13;14(10):e0008567. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008567. eCollection 2020 Oct.,10,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is endemic in the Caribbean with sporadic outbreaks in different regions. Cases in the United States are mostly imported cases but can be seen in the Gulf states as well as the Southeast. Dengue is most frequently a self-limiting illness characterized by sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, retroocular pain, general malaise, myalgias, arthralgias, and a skin rash. In a small group of patients, the same viruses may cause dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. In the Western hemisphere, dengue with hemorrhagic manifestations and dengue with shock syndrome have been documented frequently in adults. There are four serotypes of dengue viruses and all have been documented to be present in the Western hemisphere. The clinical illness is similar for any of the four serotypes; after infection there is lifelong homotypic immunity and heterotypic immunity for several months. The diagnosis of dengue is based on clinical findings and can be confirmed by serologic tests or virus isolation. There is no specific treatment for dengue; hydration is important as well as aggressive fluid management if hypotension develops. It is important to avoid aspirin and salicylates. The best treatment is prevention through mosquito control and public education to eradicate the breeding grounds for the mosquito.","['Ramirez-Ronda, C H', 'Garcia, C D']","['Ramirez-Ronda CH', 'Garcia CD']",,"['Department of Medicine, University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine, San Juan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Infect Dis Clin North Am,Infectious disease clinics of North America,8804508,,IM,"['Animals', 'Culicidae/microbiology', 'Dengue/*etiology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Humans', 'Insect Vectors']",,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Infect Dis Clin North Am. 1994 Mar;8(1):107-28.,1,,,,,,,83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We decided to build a local operational model predictive of dengue severity, which was needed to ease the healthcare circuit. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical and biological parameters associated with severe dengue in the cohort of patients hospitalized at the Territorial Hospital between January and July 2017 with confirmed dengue, in order to elaborate a comprehensive patient's score. Patients were compared in univariate and multivariate analyses. Predictive models for severity were built using a descending step-wise method. RESULTS: Out of 383 included patients, 130 (34%) developed severe dengue and 13 (3.4%) died. Major risk factors identified in univariate analysis were: age, comorbidities, presence of at least one alert sign, platelets count < 30 x 10(9)/L, prothrombin time < 60%, AST and/or ALT > 10 N, and previous dengue infection. Severity was not influenced by the infecting dengue serotype nor by previous Zika infection. Two models to predict dengue severity were built according to sex. Best models for females and males had respectively a median Area Under the Curve = 0.80 and 0.88, a sensitivity = 84.5 and 84.5%, a specificity = 78.6 and 95.5%, a positive predictive value = 63.3 and 92.9%, a negative predictive value = 92.8 and 91.3%. Models were secondarily validated on 130 patients hospitalized for dengue in 2018. CONCLUSION: We built robust and efficient models to calculate a bedside score able to predict dengue severity in our setting. We propose the spreadsheet for dengue severity score calculations to health practitioners facing dengue outbreaks of enhanced severity in order to improve patients' medical management and hospitalization flow.","['Marois, Ingrid', 'Forfait, Carole', 'Inizan, Catherine', 'Klement-Frutos, Elise', 'Valiame, Anabelle', 'Aubert, Daina', 'Gourinat, Ann-Claire', 'Laumond, Sylvie', 'Barsac, Emilie', 'Grangeon, Jean-Paul', 'Cazorla, Cecile', 'Merlet, Audrey', 'Tarantola, Arnaud', 'Dupont-Rouzeyrol, Myrielle', 'Descloux, Elodie']","['Marois I', 'Forfait C', 'Inizan C', 'Klement-Frutos E', 'Valiame A', 'Aubert D', 'Gourinat AC', 'Laumond S', 'Barsac E', 'Grangeon JP', 'Cazorla C', 'Merlet A', 'Tarantola A', 'Dupont-Rouzeyrol M', 'Descloux E']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6302-3785'],"['Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases Department, Territorial Hospital Center (CHT), Dumbea, New Caledonia.', 'Health Authorities (DASS), Noumea, New Caledonia.', 'Institut Pasteur in New Caledonia, URE Dengue and Arboviruses, Institut Pasteur International Network, Noumea, New Caledonia.', 'Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases Department, Territorial Hospital Center (CHT), Dumbea, New Caledonia. elisemma@hotmail.com.', 'Hopitaux Universitaires Pitie Salpetriere-Charles Foix, Paris, France. elisemma@hotmail.com.', 'Health Authorities (DASS), Noumea, New Caledonia.', 'Health Authorities (DASS), Noumea, New Caledonia.', 'Microbiology Laboratory, Territorial Hospital Center (CHT), Dumbea, New Caledonia.', 'Health Authorities (DASS), Noumea, New Caledonia.', 'Microbiology Laboratory, Territorial Hospital Center (CHT), Dumbea, New Caledonia.', 'Health Authorities (DASS), Noumea, New Caledonia.', 'Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases Department, Territorial Hospital Center (CHT), Dumbea, New Caledonia.', 'Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases Department, Territorial Hospital Center (CHT), Dumbea, New Caledonia.', 'Institut Pasteur in New Caledonia, URE Epidemiology, Institut Pasteur International Network, Noumea, New Caledonia.', 'Institut Pasteur in New Caledonia, URE Dengue and Arboviruses, Institut Pasteur International Network, Noumea, New Caledonia.', 'Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases Department, Territorial Hospital Center (CHT), Dumbea, New Caledonia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210524,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,,IM,"['Dengue/*classification/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Theoretical', 'New Caledonia/epidemiology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Triage']",PMC8142072,2021/05/26 06:00,2021/06/03 06:00,['2021/05/25 05:48'],"['2019/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/25 05:48 [entrez]', '2021/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-021-06146-z [pii]', '6146 [pii]', '10.1186/s12879-021-06146-z [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2021 May 24;21(1):470. doi: 10.1186/s12879-021-06146-z.,1,,['NOTNLM'],"['Arboviruses', 'Dengue', 'Hospital triage', 'Operational tool', 'Pacific', 'Severity score']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study of factors that influence dengue's clinical severity can provide information to potentially limit or predict severe cases. Secondary infection (SI) with a different dengue serotype has been recognized as an important determinant of severity. However, severe dengue (SD) manifestations, including shock, can happen during primary infection (PI) too and the mechanisms involved are less understood. To characterize the severe manifestations associated to PI, we distinguished between primary and secondary dengue cases in hospitalized patients from a region of low and recent dengue incidence in central Mexico. This region can serve as a model for dengue's behavior as it spreads to new areas worldwide. Methods: Dengue-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG concentrations were measured in the serum of 78 hospitalized patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever, and their ratios were used to discriminate between PI and SI, as recommended by World Health Organization. Clinical and laboratory manifestations were compared between PI and SI. Results and Conclusions: PI was detected in 23% of hospitalized dengue cases, a proportion similar to that reported in high-incidence regions in Mexico. PI was more frequent in 16- to 40-year-olds, and was absent in patients older than 60 years. Only dengue with warning signs and SD were present in the studied population of hospitalized patients, and case frequency decreased with clinical severity both in PI and SI groups. No significant differences in demographics, laboratory tests, or symptoms were found between PI and SI, which illustrates that cases requiring hospitalization during outbreaks can be severe, even if they are PI. This information can help plan for sanitary contingencies in places where dengue is recently emergent and numerous PI cases are expected. The mechanisms involved in PI clinical severity need to be studied further.","['Cardenas-Perea, Maria Elena', 'Flores-Mendoza, Lilian Karem', 'Perez-Contreras, Irma', 'Diaz-Orea, Maria Alicia', 'Gomez-Conde, Eduardo', 'Cortes-Hernandez, Paulina', 'Reyes-Leyva, Julio', 'Santos-Lopez, Gerardo', 'Sosa-Jurado, Francisca']","['Cardenas-Perea ME', 'Flores-Mendoza LK', 'Perez-Contreras I', 'Diaz-Orea MA', 'Gomez-Conde E', 'Cortes-Hernandez P', 'Reyes-Leyva J', 'Santos-Lopez G', 'Sosa-Jurado F']",,"['Departamento de Microbiologia y Parasitologia, Facultad de Medicina de la Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Division de Ciencias e Ingenieria, Departamento de Ciencias Quimico Biologicas y Agropecuarias, Universidad de Sonora, Navojoa, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Salud Publica, Facultad de Medicina de la Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Inmunologia, Facultad de Medicina de la Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Inmunologia, Facultad de Medicina de la Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Celular, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Oriente del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social en Metepec, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular y Virologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Oriente del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social en Metepec, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular y Virologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Oriente del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social en Metepec, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular y Virologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Oriente del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social en Metepec, Puebla, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200114,United States,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)",100965525,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,2020/01/15 06:00,2021/01/29 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/vbz.2019.2497 [doi]'],ppublish,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2020 May;20(5):380-386. doi: 10.1089/vbz.2019.2497.

Although the Brazilian surveillance system reports more dengue cases than any other country, recent studies suggest that non-reported cases are the majority. The aim of the study is to explore the strengths and weaknesses of the Brazilian surveillance system, particularly looking at the functioning of data collection and reporting. This was done through qualitative semi-structured interviews with 17 experts in dengue surveillance, supported by quantitative data from the official notification system. To select the interviewees, purposive and theoretical sampling were used. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis. The research highlighted that a lack of human and technological resources in healthcare units and surveillance departments slows down the notification process and data analysis. Due to a lack of integration in the private sector, the surveillance system fails to detect the socioeconomic profile of the patients. Investments in public healthcare, human and technological resources for surveillance and better integration in the private healthcare system, and vector surveillance may improve dengue surveillance.","['Angelo, Marco', 'Ramalho, Walter Massa', 'Gurgel, Helen', 'Belle, Nayara', 'Pilot, Eva']","['Angelo M', 'Ramalho WM', 'Gurgel H', 'Belle N', 'Pilot E']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4250-6742', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4207-9055', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3112-4447']","['Department of Health, Ethics & Society, Maastricht University, 6200 MD Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Nucleo de Medicina Tropical, Universidade de Brasilia, 70297-400 Brasilia, Brazil.', 'Nucleo de Medicina Tropical, Universidade de Brasilia, 70297-400 Brasilia, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Geografia, Ambiente e Saude da Universidade de Brasilia, 70904-970 Brasilia, Brazil.', 'Department of Health, Ethics & Society, Maastricht University, 6200 MD Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratorio de Geografia, Ambiente e Saude da Universidade de Brasilia, 70904-970 Brasilia, Brazil.', 'Department of Health, Ethics & Society, Maastricht University, 6200 MD Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Centre of Studies in Geography and Spatial Planning (CEGOT), University of Coimbra, 3004-530 Coimbra, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200320,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,,IM,"['Animals', 'Brazil', '*Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Disease Vectors', 'Humans', '*Population Surveillance', 'Qualitative Research']",PMC7142734,2020/04/05 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2020/04/05 06:00'],"['2020/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph17062062 [pii]', 'ijerph-17-02062 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph17062062 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2020 Mar 20;17(6):2062. doi: 10.3390/ijerph17062062.,6,,['NOTNLM'],"['dengue', 'health geography', 'health information', 'infectious diseases', 'public health', 'qualitative research', 'surveillance', 'tropical diseases', 'underreporting', 'urban health']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For each step in this process, the highest available level of evidence has been applied. This process has been initiated by the World Health Organization's (WHO) Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and WHO's Department for Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD), developing the following for dengue. Since the early 1970s, dengue has been classified into dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever grades I and II and dengue shock syndrome grades III and IV (DF/DHF/DSS). However, in recent years, a growing number of dengue clinicians have questioned the shortcomings of this scheme. The issues have revolved around the complexity of confirming DHF in clinical practice, misclassifying severe cases as DF, and the emphasis on haemorrhage rather than plasma leakage as the underlying problem in most severe dengue cases. Step 1: A systematic literature review highlighted the shortcomings of the DF/DHF/DSS scheme: (1) difficulties in applying the criteria for DHF/DSS; (2) the tourniquet test has a low sensitivity for distinguishing between DHF and DF; and (3) most DHF criteria had a large variability in frequency of occurrence. Step 2: An analysis of regional and national dengue guidelines and their application in the clinical practice showed a need to re-evaluate and standardize guidelines as the actual ones showed a large variation of definitions, an inconsistent application by medical staff, and a lack of diagnostic facilities necessary for the DHF diagnosis in frontline services. Step 3: A prospective cohort study in seven countries, confirmed the difficulties in applying the DF/DHF/DSS criteria even in tertiary care hospitals, that DF/DHF/DSS do not represent levels of disease severity and that a clear distinction between severe dengue (defined by plasma leakage and/or severe haemorrhage, and/or organ failure) and (non-severe) dengue can be made using highly sensitive and specific criteria. In contrast, the sub-grouping of (non-severe) dengue into two further severity levels was only possible with criteria that gave approximately 70% sensitivity and specificity. Step 4: Three regional expert consensus groups in the Americas and Asia concluded that 'dengue is one disease entity with different clinical presentations and often with unpredictable clinical evolution and outcome' and that, revising the results of Step 3, DF/DHF/DSS is not related to disease severity. Step 5: In a global expert consensus meeting at WHO in Geneva/Switzerland the evidence collected in Steps 1-4 was reviewed and a revised scheme was developed and accepted, distinguishing: dengue with or without warning signs and severe dengue; the further field testing and acquisition of further prospective evidence of the revised scheme was recommended. Step 6: In 18 countries, the usefulness and applicability of the revised classification compared to the DF/DHF/DSS scheme were tested showing clear results in favour of the revised classification. Step 7: Studies are under way on the predictive value of warning signs for severe dengue and on criteria for the clinical diagnosis of dengue which will complete the evidence foundation of the revised classification. The analysis has shown that the revised dengue case classification is better able to standardize clinical management, raise awareness about unnecessary interventions, match patient categories with specific treatment instructions, and make the key messages of patient management understandable for all health care staff dealing with dengue patients. Furthermore, the evidence-based approach to develop prospectively the dengue case classification could be a model approach for other disease classifications.","['Horstick, O', 'Farrar, J', 'Lum, L', 'Martinez, E', 'San Martin, J L', 'Ehrenberg, J', 'Velayudhan, R', 'Kroeger, A']","['Horstick O', 'Farrar J', 'Lum L', 'Martinez E', 'San Martin JL', 'Ehrenberg J', 'Velayudhan R', 'Kroeger A']",,"['Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR_WHO), Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,England,Pathog Glob Health,Pathogens and global health,101583421,,IM,"['Biomedical Research/trends', 'Clinical Medicine/trends', 'Dengue/*classification/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Tropical Medicine/*trends']",PMC3408880,2012/09/05 06:00,2013/01/24 06:00,['2012/09/05 06:00'],"['2012/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['42 [pii]', '10.1179/2047773212Y.0000000017 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathog Glob Health. 2012 May;106(2):94-101. doi: 10.1179/2047773212Y.0000000017.,2,,,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vector-borne diseases, such as dengue, may be particularly sensitive to both periodic fluctuations and sustained changes in global and local climates, because vector biology and viral replication are temperature- and moisture-dependent. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on the associations between climate variability, climate change and dengue transmission, and the tools being used to quantify these associations. The underlying causes of dengue's recent global expansion are multifactorial and poorly understood, but climatic factors should be considered within the context of the sociodemographic, economic and immunological determinants that have contributed to dengue's spread. These factors may mediate the direct effects of climate on dengue and many may operate at a very local level. Translating theoretical models of dengue transmission based on historical data into predictive models that can inform public health interventions is a critical next step and efforts should be focused on developing and refining models at smaller spatial scales to characterize the relationships between both climatic and non-climatic factors and dengue risk.","['Thai, Khoa T D', 'Anders, Katherine L']","['Thai KT', 'Anders KL']",,"['Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Hospital for Tropical Diseases, 190 Ben Ham Tu, District 5, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. khoat@oucru.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20110707,England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,,IM,"['*Climate Change', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*transmission', 'Humans', 'Humidity', 'Public Health', 'Temperature']",,2011/07/09 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['ebm.2011.010402 [pii]', '10.1258/ebm.2011.010402 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2011 Aug;236(8):944-54. doi: 10.1258/ebm.2011.010402.

Dengue has extended to different tropical areas and older age groups. Variations from the original description of dengue manifestations are being reported. OBJECTIVES: To analyse the experience of clinicians in using the dengue case classification and identify challenges in applying the criteria in routine clinical practice. METHOD: Systematic literature review of post-1975 English-language publications on dengue classification. RESULTS: Thirty-seven papers were reviewed. Several studies had strictly applied all four WHO criteria in DHF cases; however, most clinicians reported difficulties in meeting all four criteria and used a modified classification. The positive tourniquet test representing the minimum requirement of a haemorrhagic manifestation did not distinguish between DHF and DF. In cases of DHF thrombocytopenia was observed in 8.6-96%, plasma leakage in 6-95% and haemorrhagic manifestations in 22-93%. The low sensitivity of classifying DHF could be due to failure to repeat the tests or physical examinations at the appropriate time, early intravenous fluid therapy, and lack of adequate resources in an epidemic situation and perhaps a considerable overlap of clinical manifestations in the different dengue entities. CONCLUSION: A prospective multi-centre study across dengue endemic regions, age groups and the health care system is required which describes the clinical presentation of dengue including simple laboratory parameters in order to review and if necessary modify the current dengue classification.","['Bandyopadhyay, Shibani', 'Lum, Lucy C S', 'Kroeger, Axel']","['Bandyopadhyay S', 'Lum LC', 'Kroeger A']",,"['Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,England,Trop Med Int Health,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,9610576,,IM,"['Capillary Permeability/physiology', 'Dengue/*classification/complications/diagnosis', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Humans', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severe Dengue/classification/complications/diagnosis', 'Thrombocytopenia/complications', 'Tourniquets', 'World Health Organization']",,2006/08/15 09:00,2006/08/29 09:00,['2006/08/15 09:00'],"['2006/08/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['TMI1678 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3156.2006.01678.x [doi]']",ppublish,Trop Med Int Health. 2006 Aug;11(8):1238-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2006.01678.x.,8,,,,,,,84,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For such a medical research that requires a multi-directional approach to resolve a variety of research questions, sometimes it is necessary to step back and re-examine historically how the current status of the expanding global problems and sudden emergence of severe forms of dengue have evolved in the first place. To examine the history of dengue epidemiology, it is first necessary to put in perspective all relevant documents, including a large number of nearly forgotten, old Japanese publications regarding dengue outbreaks and allied background information in East Asia and the Western Pacific that were documented before the emergence of the haemorrhagic disease outbreaks in the 1950s there. The compiled data in this review, thus, fill in for the first time many blanks in the early epidemiologic history of dengue in this part of the world.

To decide whether and where to support the introduction of new vaccines it is crucial to assess costs imposed by the disease and cost-effectiveness of vaccine programmes. OBJECTIVE: To identify economic evidence about dengue fever immunization, by systematic review, to assist future policy decisions and investment. METHODS: The electronic search stage was conducted on PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Global Health, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) databases. Searches were restricted to papers published between January 1970 and February 2016. Selected papers were quality assessed using three recognized checklists. RESULTS: Eleven relevant studies were identified and there is economic evidence of a satisfactory quality level, derived through modelling approaches, to conclude that dengue fever vaccines will be economically advantageous when compared to vector preventive strategies, despite uncertainties surrounding vaccine efficacy and costs per vaccine dose. Quality assessment based on checklists showed similar findings and although overall quality was considered satisfactory, there were relevant methodological issues not considered among studies reviewed. CONCLUSION: Several uncertainties still remain about effectiveness of dengue fever vaccines; however, the reviewed economic evidence suggests that, when available, the vaccine can be economically advantageous at moderate prices. Future research needs to confirm findings from the economic models by using actual costs and effectiveness data.","['Endo, Iara C', 'Ziegelmann, Patricia K', 'Patel, Anita']","['Endo IC', 'Ziegelmann PK', 'Patel A']",,"['Ministry of Planning, Development and Management, Brasilia, Brazil; Ministry of Health, Brasilia, Brazil.

However, while major epidemics continue to occur, clinicians must also focus on optimising management. Although no specific treatment is available at present, with good supportive care, mortality for children with DHF can be reduced to well below 1%. In patients without signs of shock, fluid replacement can be attempted orally, but in children with DSS parenteral treatment is essential. Very careful titration of fluid therapy is necessary combined with frequent reassessment for signs of worsening shock or the development of fluid overload. In most DSS cases isotonic crystalloid solutions are as effective as colloid solutions, but the question whether early intervention with colloid solutions improves outcome in more advanced shock requires further investigation. The outcome of studies to address this question, together with further research to examine the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the plasma leakage, will hopefully result in better management of children with severe dengue but may also provide useful insights into other diseases that affect endothelial function.","['Moxon, Christopher', 'Wills, Bridget']","['Moxon C', 'Wills B']",,"['Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,IM,"['Child', 'Dengue/physiopathology/*therapy/virology', 'Dengue Virus/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Severe Dengue/physiopathology/*therapy']",,2008/01/16 09:00,2008/02/20 09:00,['2008/01/16 09:00'],"['2008/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-0-387-73960-1_10 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2008;609:131-44. doi: 10.1007/978-0-387-73960-1_10.,,,,,,,,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ae. aegypti is considered the primary DENV vector and has repeatedly been incriminated as a driving force in dengue's worldwide emergence. What remains unresolved is the extent to which Ae. albopictus contributes to DENV transmission and whether an improved understanding of its vector status would enhance dengue surveillance and prevention. To assess the relative public health importance of Ae. albopictus for dengue, we carried out two complementary analyses. We reviewed its role in past dengue epidemics and compared its DENV vector competence with that of Ae. aegypti. Observations from ""natural experiments"" indicate that, despite seemingly favorable conditions, places where Ae. albopictus predominates over Ae. aegypti have never experienced a typical explosive dengue epidemic with severe cases of the disease. Results from a meta-analysis of experimental laboratory studies reveal that although Ae. albopictus is overall more susceptible to DENV midgut infection, rates of virus dissemination from the midgut to other tissues are significantly lower in Ae. albopictus than in Ae. aegypti. For both indices of vector competence, a few generations of mosquito colonization appear to result in a relative increase of Ae. albopictus susceptibility, which may have been a confounding factor in the literature. Our results lead to the conclusion that Ae. albopictus plays a relatively minor role compared to Ae. aegypti in DENV transmission, at least in part due to differences in host preferences and reduced vector competence. Recent examples of rapid arboviral adaptation to alternative mosquito vectors, however, call for cautious extrapolation of our conclusion. Vector status is a dynamic process that in the future could change in epidemiologically important ways.","['Lambrechts, Louis', 'Scott, Thomas W', 'Gubler, Duane J']","['Lambrechts L', 'Scott TW', 'Gubler DJ']",,"['Department of Virology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. louis.lambrechts@pasteur.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20100525,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Aedes/*growth & development', 'Animals', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*transmission', 'Dengue Virus/*isolation & purification', 'Disease Outbreaks', '*Disease Vectors', 'Humans']",PMC2876112,2010/06/04 06:00,2010/08/07 06:00,['2010/06/04 06:00'],"['2010/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['09-PNTD-RV-0623R2 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0000646 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2010 May 25;4(5):e646. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000646.,5,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,['R01 GM083224-01A1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a number of studies have described a continuation of dengue symptoms for weeks or months, extending the recovery phase. Here we evaluate this persistence of dengue symptoms during convalescence. METHODS: Our clinical cohort study included patients who sought medical services 48 to 144 h from the onset of fever at seven hospitals or ambulatory centers in Morelos, Mexico. Seventy-nine laboratory-confirmed dengue patients were followed up regularly using clinic and/or home visits and telephone calls for as long as symptoms persisted or up to 6 mo. RESULTS: In total, 55.7% of patients had dengue-related symptoms 1 mo after the onset of fever; pain and dermatological manifestations were the most common persistent symptoms. Prognostic factors for symptom persistence were: >/=4 d of fever (RR 1.72; 95% CI 1.35 to 2.19), platelet count </=100 000/mm3 (RR 1.20; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.20), petechiae/bruises (RR 1.97; 95% CI 1.56 to 2.48) and abdominal pain/hepatomegaly (RR 1.79; 95% CI 1.41 to 2.28). CONCLUSIONS: Persistence of dengue symptoms were common in laboratory-confirmed dengue patients. Manifestations related to tissue damage were associated with persistence after 30 d; host characteristics, such as age and health status before infection, were associated with prolonged persistence (>60 d). The burden of dengue may be higher than previously estimated.","['Tiga-Loza, Diana Carolina', 'Martinez-Vega, Ruth A', 'Undurraga, Eduardo A', 'Tschampl, Cynthia A', 'Shepard, Donald S', 'Ramos-Castaneda, Jose']","['Tiga-Loza DC', 'Martinez-Vega RA', 'Undurraga EA', 'Tschampl CA', 'Shepard DS', 'Ramos-Castaneda J']",,"['Programa de enfermeria, Universidad Manuela Beltran, Bucaramanga, Santander, Colombia.', 'Centro de investigaciones sobre enfermedades infecciosas, Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.', 'Escuela de Microbiologia, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Santander, Colombia.', 'Escuela de Gobierno, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Millennium Nucleus for the Study of the Life Course and Vulnerability (MLIV), Chile.', 'Schneider Institutes for Health Policy, Heller School, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Schneider Institutes for Health Policy, Heller School, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Centro de investigaciones sobre enfermedades infecciosas, Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.', 'Universidad Anahuac, Centro de Investigacion en Ciencias de la Salud.

Today, dengue is considered one of the most important arthropod-borne viral diseases in humans in terms of morbidity and mortality. Globally, it is estimated that approximate 50 to 100 million new dengue virus infections occur annually. Among these, there are 200,000 to 500,000 cases of potential life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS), characterized by thrombocytopenia and increased vascular permeability. The death rate associated with the more severe form DHF/DSS is approximately 5%, predominantly in children under the age of 15. Although intensive efforts have been made to study the early clinical pathophysiology of dengue infection with the objective to identify the potential cause of DHF, results or data that have accumulated from different regions of the world involving studies of different ethnicity groups are inconsistent at present in terms of identifying a unified hypothesis for the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS. Thus, the potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of DHF and DSS remain elusive. The purpose of this review is to identify alternate factors, such as innate immune parameters, hyper-thermal factors, conditioning of neutralizing antibody, concept of vector transmission, and physical status of virus in viremic patients that may play a role in the induction of DHF and DSS, which might have directly or indirectly contributed to the discrepancies that are noted in the literature reported to date. It is the hope that identification of an alternative explanation for the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS will pave the way for the institution of new strategies for the prevention of this complicated disease.","['Noisakran, Sansanee', 'Perng, Guey Chuen']","['Noisakran S', 'Perng GC']",,"['Medical Biotechnology Unit, National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, National Science and Technology Development Agency, Pathumthani, 12120, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,['0 (Immunoglobulin M)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Dengue/epidemiology/etiology/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Dengue Virus/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/physiology', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Insect Vectors', 'Severe Dengue/epidemiology/etiology/immunology/*physiopathology']",,2008/03/28 09:00,2008/06/19 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['233/4/401 [pii]', '10.3181/0707-MR-198 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2008 Apr;233(4):401-8. doi: 10.3181/0707-MR-198.,4,,,,,,,105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Foreword.,S1-2,10.1016/S1386-6532(09)70285-9 [doi],"Dengue is a major global health concern. Its increasing incidence and continued geographical spread make the development of an effective vaccine an international health priority. Dengue is currently present in more than one hundred countries, while up to 3 billion people are estimated to be at risk of infection. In addition, dengue is associated with a substantial economic burden that is particularly severe at the individual family level. Establishing the full human cost and economic impact of dengue remains urgent. The approaches being investigated for vaccine development include the use of live, vectored and killed, and recombinant preparations. Vaccine candidates must provide broad and robust immunity to all four dengue serotypes simultaneously as secondary dengue infections may lead to enhanced disease severity. The design, implementation, and surveillance measures associated with dengue vaccine trials need to be particularly rigorous due to the complexity of the disease and its epidemiology. Therefore, eligible trial sites must satisfy several criteria including documented hyper-endemicity and a known epidemiological history of the circulating serotypes. Epidemiological data from Ratchaburi province in Thailand strongly support this location's suitability for a proof-of-concept efficacy trial of the sanofi pasteur tetravalent dengue vaccine. Accurate disease surveillance and carefully monitored clinical trials will provide essential evidence concerning the efficacy of candidate dengue vaccines, which will hopefully herald a new era in dengue disease prevention.","['Singhasivanon, Pratap', 'Jacobson, Julie']","['Singhasivanon P', 'Jacobson J']",,"['Regional Centre for Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Thailand. tmpsh@mucc.mahidol.ac.th']",['eng'],"['Introductory Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,J Clin Virol,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,9815671,['0 (Dengue Vaccines)'],IM,"['Dengue/*epidemiology/*prevention & control', '*Dengue Vaccines', '*Global Health', 'Humans']",,2009/10/06 06:00,2010/01/19 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S1386-6532(09)70285-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S1386-6532(09)70285-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Virol. 2009 Oct;46 Suppl 2:S1-2. doi: 10.1016/S1386-6532(09)70285-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize and quantify the scientific output of dengue research in Arab countries relative to that worldwide by using a bibliometric analysis. METHODS: The standardized search approach based on the use of the the keyword ""dengue"" in the title, abstract, and keyword field was used to get research output related to dengue at a global level. All data related to dengue were collected from the past to December 31, 2015. RESULTS: A total of 19,581 dengue-related documents identified in the Scopus database. The results show that the study of dengue exhibits an overall upward trend from 1872 to 2015 with peak publications in 2014. The leading countries in dengue research were the USA (4,709; 24.05 %), India (1,942; 9.92 %), Brazil (1,530; 7.81 %), Thailand (1,260; 6.43 %), the UK (1,129; 5.77 %), and France (1,087; 5.55 %). Only 226 (1.16 % of the overall global research effort in the dengue field) articles were published from the Arab region. The total number of citations for all publications was 352,710, with an average of 18.0 citations per publication. Furthermore, the h-index for all extracted data related to dengue research was 186. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was the most productive country in Arab region with 102 documents representing 45.1 %. Furthermore, the h-index for all extracted data related to dengue research was 27. The USA was Arab's most main cooperative partner (46, 20.4 %), followed by India (36, 15.9 %). CONCLUSIONS: The amount of literature related to dengue research has considerably increased over the last decade.

It can be primary, which involves genetic mutation with an early presentation, or secondary to infections, malignancies, etc., due to absence of immune downregulation. It is a very rare condition in newborns. Dengue is a potential virus causing HLH, but, in newborns, there are only few case reports and limited clinical literature. OBSERVATION: Herein, in this report, we highlight a case of neonatal HLH, triggered by perinatal dengue. The neonate manifested clinically within the first week of life, the earliest reported timeline so far in the literature. CONCLUSION: HLH should be excluded in neonates especially when multisystem involvement cannot be explained by sepsis alone.","['Krishnappa, Archana', 'Munusamy, Jeyaraj', 'Ray, Somosri', 'Rameshbabu, Monisha', 'Bhatia, Prateek', 'Roy, Pritam S', 'Sundaram, Venkataseshan', 'Kumar, Praveen']","['Krishnappa A', 'Munusamy J', 'Ray S', 'Rameshbabu M', 'Bhatia P', 'Roy PS', 'Sundaram V', 'Kumar P']",,"['Departments of Pediatric Medicine.', 'Departments of Pediatric Medicine.', 'Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Neonatology.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research.', 'Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Dengue/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Dengue Virus/isolation & purification', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Male']",,2020/07/18 06:00,2021/09/03 06:00,['2020/07/18 06:00'],"['2020/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['00043426-202108000-00015 [pii]', '10.1097/MPH.0000000000001881 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 Aug 1;43(6):e770-e773. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001881.,6,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This article reviews the latest findings in the field of DEN pathogenesis, vector control and vaccine development. RECENT FINDINGS: Atypical clinical manifestations as well as a shift in the age of DEN-infected patients have forced a revisit of the current definitions and classifications of the DEN-associated diseases. The antibody-mediated internalization of DEN virus triggers intracellular pathways that further enhance viral replication and output. A correlation between the human leukocyte antigen system and disease severity was found. The development of tetravalent DEN vaccine candidates is reaching its final stages, though the antibody levels required to protect against the four DEN serotypes are still unknown. SUMMARY: Efforts have been devoted to identify the host target cells that are permissive or resistant to DEN virus replication and to decipher the downstream events that would result in either disease enhancement or protection. Strong emphasis has recently been made on genetic polymorphisms that confer DEN protection versus susceptibility to severe DEN. The increasing knowledge gained from basic science should help to better design effective DEN vaccines.","['Tan, Grace K', 'Alonso, Sylvie']","['Tan GK', 'Alonso S']",,"['Department of Microbiology, Immunology Programme, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Current opinion in infectious diseases,8809878,['0 (Dengue Vaccines)'],IM,"['Dengue/epidemiology/*pathology/*prevention & control', 'Dengue Vaccines/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Mosquito Control/*methods']",,2009/03/06 09:00,2009/05/15 09:00,['2009/03/06 09:00'],"['2009/03/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/QCO.0b013e328329ae32 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2009 Jun;22(3):302-8. doi: 10.1097/QCO.0b013e328329ae32.,3,,,,,,,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To generate such data for Indonesia, we reviewed recent literature, analyzed expenditure and utilization data from two hospitals and two primary care facilities in Yogyakarta city, and interviewed 67 dengue patients from hospital, ambulatory, and not medically attended settings. We derived the cost of a dengue episode by outcome, setting, and the breakdown by payer. We then calculated aggregate Yogyakarta and national costs and 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UIs). Dengue costs per nonfatal case in hospital, ambulatory, not medically attended, and overall average settings were US$316.24 (95% UI: $242.30-$390.18), US$22.45 (95% UI: $14.12-$30.77), US$7.48 (95% UI: $2.36-$12.60), and US$50.41 (95% UI: $35.75-$65.07), respectively. Costs of nonfatal episodes were borne by the patient's household (37%), social contributors (relatives and friends, 20%), national health insurance (25%), and other sources (government, charity, and private insurance, 18%). After including fatal cases, the average cost per episode became $90.41 (95% UI: $72.79-$112.35). Indonesia had an estimated 7.535 (95% UI: 1.319-16.513) million dengue episodes in 2017, giving national aggregate costs of $681.26 (95% UI: $232.28-$2,371.56) million. Unlike most previous research that examined only the formal medical sector, this study included the estimated 63% of national dengue episodes that were not medically attended. Also, this study used actual costs, rather than charges, which generally understate dengue's economic burden in public facilities. Overall, this study found that Indonesia's aggregate cost of dengue was 73% higher than previously estimated, strengthening the need for effective control.","['Wilastonegoro, Nandyan N', 'Kharisma, Dinar D', 'Laksono, Ida S', 'Halasa-Rappel, Yara A', 'Brady, Oliver J', 'Shepard, Donald S']","['Wilastonegoro NN', 'Kharisma DD', 'Laksono IS', 'Halasa-Rappel YA', 'Brady OJ', 'Shepard DS']",,"['Faculty of Medicine, Public Health and Nursing, Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.', 'Heller School for Social Management and Policy, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'Pediatrics Department, Faculty of Medicine, Public Health and Nursing, Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.', 'Heller School for Social Management and Policy, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Public Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Heller School for Social Management and Policy, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Trop Med Hyg,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,0370507,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Ambulatory Care/*economics', 'Dengue/*economics/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Economics, Hospital', 'Female', '*Health Care Costs', '*Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Indonesia/epidemiology', 'Male']",PMC7646801,2020/09/10 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2020/09/09 08:46'],"['2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/09 08:46 [entrez]']","['tpmd190855 [pii]', '10.4269/ajtmh.19-0855 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2020 Nov;103(5):2029-2039. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.19-0855.,5,,,,"['Disclosure: The funders had no role in study design, data collection and', 'analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical manifestations, epidemiologic information, and laboratory findings are described for a series of 18 Israeli travelers who tested serologically positive for dengue. RESULTS: All the patients in the series contracted the disease in Southeast Asia, mostly in Thailand; 30% had to be evacuated due to severe morbidity. The clinical symptoms in travelers somewhat differ from the classical description among endogenous populations. High fever, chills, extreme fatigue, and severe headaches were prevalent. Other symptoms considered to be typical of dengue fever, such as myalgia, arthralgia, rash, biphasic fever, were uncommon. Laboratory findings were marked leukopenia, usually accompanied by lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, liver function impairment, and hyponatremia. Some hemorrhagic phenomena were manifest despite it being the first exposure, without mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue fever among the nonimmune has a somewhat different manifestation from that reported for the Southeast Asian population. Although it is a significant cause for morbidity and hospitalization, it is underestimated as a factor affecting traveler's health. More efforts should be expended in developing an effective vaccine.","['Schwartz, E', 'Mendelson, E', 'Sidi, Y']","['Schwartz E', 'Mendelson E', 'Sidi Y']",,"['Center of Geographical Medicine, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,,IM,"['Adult', 'Dengue/blood/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Travel']",,1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002934396002781 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9343(96)00278-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1996 Nov;101(5):516-20. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9343(96)00278-1.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dengue is an illness typically found in the tropics that has affected more and more people. In Brazil, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2013 at least 12.9% of the population (25.8 million) reported already having had dengue in their life. So, how wide are the economic impacts that dengue's contagion has on the gross national product? Using Leontief's method, it became possible to estimate the direct and indirect impact on the workforce and output by one country. Workforce absenteeism reduced the national productiveness and welfare state where we found maximum inoperability of 0.027% and a minimum of 0.002%. This paper develops a methodology for estimation of the impact dengue has incurred in each sector of an economy; designing a ranking with sectors that have been more affected and forecasting the propagation of the endemic throughout a region. This research measures the impact of dengue on economy, the result was that the total loss of the Brazilian economy in 2013 was around BRL 1,023,174,876.83; the importance of 0.02% of the Gross Domestic Product.","['Montibeler, Everlam Elias', 'Oliveira, Daniel Ribeiro de']","['Montibeler EE', 'Oliveira DR']",,"['Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

METHODOLOGY: A prospective observational study was conducted from September 2016 to August 2017that included forty NS-1 antigen (IgM) Dengue positive patients. Clinical features, laboratory parameters and outcome of dengue patients were noted. RESULTS: All the patients had travel history outside the valley into the neighbouring state. Most patients (70%) had duration of stay between 21-30 days in dengue prevalent areas before catching the illness. Duration of symptoms was between 4-9 days in majority of patients (92.5%). Most patients (85%) presented in months of September to November. The three most common symptoms were fever (100%), chills (92.5%) and headache (80%). The most common laboratory features were thrombocytopenia (97.5%), leukopenia (87.5%), transaminitis (87.5%) and raised LDH (32.5%). One patient developed Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF). All patients recovered completely. CONCLUSION: DF in Kashmir is seen exclusively in travellers to other states especially in the monsoon season.DF in Kashmiri patients has a favourable outcome despite low baseline platelet count. DHF is uncommon in Kashmiri population.","['Naik, Muzafar', 'Bhat, Tariq', 'Wani, Abdul Ahad', 'Amin, Abid', 'Jalaalie, Ummer']","['Naik M', 'Bhat T', 'Wani AA', 'Amin A', 'Jalaalie U']",,"['Associate Professor, SKIMS MCH, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.', 'Associate Professor, SKIMS MCH, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.', 'Assistant Professor, SKIMS MCH, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir; Corresponding Author.', 'Senior Resident, SKIMS MCH, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.', 'Senior Resident, SKIMS MCH, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,India,J Assoc Physicians India,The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,7505585,,IM,"['*Dengue/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Laboratories', '*Leukopenia', '*Thrombocytopenia/epidemiology/etiology']",,2022/01/22 06:00,2022/01/27 06:00,['2022/01/21 04:43'],"['2022/01/21 04:43 [entrez]', '2022/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Physicians India. 2022 Dec;69(12):11-12.,12,['(c) Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The range of dengue vectors is expanding with climate change, yet United States of America (USA) studies on dengue epidemiology and burden are limited. This systematic review sought to characterize the epidemiology and disease burden of dengue within the USA. METHODS: Studies evaluating travel-related and endemic dengue in US states and territories were identified and qualitatively summarized. Commentaries and studies on ex-US cases were excluded. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Latin American and Caribbean Center of Health Sciences Information, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched through January 2022. RESULTS: 116 studies were included. In US states, dengue incidence was generally low, with spikes occurring in recent years in 2013-16 (0.17-0.31 cases/100,000) and peaking in 2019 (0.35 cases/100,000). Most cases (94%, n = 7895, 2010-21) were travel related. Dengue was more common in Puerto Rico (cumulative average: 200 cases/100,000, 1980-2015); in 2010-21, 99.9% of cases were locally acquired. There were <50 severe cases in US states (2010-17); fatal cases were even rarer. Severe cases in Puerto Rico peaked in 1998 (n = 173) and 2021 (n = 76). Besides lower income, risk factors in US states included having birds in residence, suggesting unspecified environmental characteristics favourable to dengue vectors. Commonly reported symptoms included fever, headache and rash; median disease duration was 3.5-11 days. Hospitalization rates increased following 2009 World Health Organization disease classification changes (pre-2009: 0-54%; post-2009: 14-75%); median length of stay was 2.7-8 days (Puerto Rico) and 2-3 days (US states). Hospitalization costs/case (2010 USD) were$14 350 (US states),$1764-$5497 (Puerto Rico) and$4207 (US Virgin Islands). In Puerto Rico, average days missed were 0.2-5.3 (work) and 2.5 (school). CONCLUSIONS: Though dengue risk is ongoing, treatments are limited, and dengue's economic burden is high. There is an urgent need for additional preventive and therapeutic interventions.","['Chen, Lin H', 'Marti, Carlos', 'Diaz Perez, Clemente', 'Jackson, Bianca M', 'Simon, Alyssa M', 'Lu, Mei']","['Chen LH', 'Marti C', 'Diaz Perez C', 'Jackson BM', 'Simon AM', 'Lu M']",,"['Division of Infectious Diseases and Travel Medicine, Mount Auburn Hospital, 330 Mount Auburn Street Suite 413 Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.', 'Associate Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, 25 Shattuck Street Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, San Juan City Hospital, Paseo Dr. Jose Celso Barbosa San Juan, PR 00921, Puerto Rico.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine, Medical Sciences Campus, San Juan, PR 00936, Puerto Rico.', 'Evidence & Access, OPEN Health, 25 Recreation Park Drive, Suite 200 Hingham, MA 02043, USA.', 'Evidence & Access, OPEN Health, 25 Recreation Park Drive, Suite 200 Hingham, MA 02043, USA.', 'Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc., 95 Hayden Avenue Lexington, MA 0242195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",,England,J Travel Med,Journal of travel medicine,9434456,,IM,"['United States/epidemiology', 'Humans', '*Travel', 'Travel-Related Illness', 'Caribbean Region', 'Climate Change', '*Dengue/epidemiology']",,2023/10/04 18:42,2023/11/21 06:43,['2023/10/04 13:45'],"['2023/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2023/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2023/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/11/21 06:43 [medline]', '2023/10/04 18:42 [pubmed]', '2023/10/04 13:45 [entrez]']","['7288959 [pii]', '10.1093/jtm/taad127 [doi]']",ppublish,J Travel Med. 2023 Nov 18;30(7):taad127. doi: 10.1093/jtm/taad127.,7,"['(c) International Society of Travel Medicine 2023.

(2) Is the spatial resolution of a climate dataset an important determinant of model accuracy? (3) Does inclusion of the future distributions of vectors affect predictions of the futures of the diseases they transmit? (4) Which are the key predictor variables involved in determining the distributions of vector-borne diseases in the present and future? Examples are given of dengue models using one, five or 10 meteorological variables and at spatial resolutions of from one-sixth to two degrees. Model accuracy is improved with a greater number of descriptor variables, but is surprisingly unaffected by the spatial resolution of the data. Dengue models with a reduced set of climate variables derived from the HadCM3 global circulation model predictions for the 1980s are improved when risk maps for dengue's two main vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) are also included as predictor variables; disease and vector models are projected into the future using the global circulation model predictions for the 2020s, 2040s and 2080s. The Garthwaite-Koch corr-max transformation is presented as a novel way of showing the relative contribution of each of the input predictor variables to the map predictions.","['Rogers, David J']",['Rogers DJ'],,"['Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PS, UK david.rogers@zoo.ox.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

While intense investigations in multiple directions have been conducted for many years to elucidate the intrinsic mechanisms conducive to the development of DHF, no consensus has yet emerged. Meanwhile, relatively little attention has been paid to the occurrence of severe dengue and death prior to the 1950s. This comprehensive review was designed to evaluate outbreak records in the early dengue history to better understand the epidemiologic background and other factors that existed before the emergence of DHF outbreaks. By applying a set of stringent criteria to remove unreliable data as much as possible and by interpreting the results conservatively, a short list of etiologically more reliable outbreaks with high mortality was obtained. The results show that severe dengue syndrome, clinically very much compatible with DHF, occurred far more frequently in multiple locations than it had been assumed before; that the magnitudes of mortality in several outbreaks were not negligible; and that the epidemiologic background features shared among these outbreaks in the early period were, with the exceptions of more limited demographic changes, generally similar to the post-1950 conditions.","['Kuno, Goro']",['Kuno G'],,"['Arboviral Diseases Branch, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA. gok1@cdc.gov']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Microbiol Rev,Clinical microbiology reviews,8807282,,IM,"['*Dengue/epidemiology/history/mortality/virology', 'Dengue Virus', '*Disease Outbreaks/history', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', '*Severe Dengue/epidemiology/history/mortality/virology']",PMC2668235,2009/04/16 09:00,2009/08/15 09:00,['2009/04/16 09:00'],"['2009/04/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/15 09:00 [medline]']","['22/2/186 [pii]', '0052-08 [pii]', '10.1128/CMR.00052-08 [doi]']",ppublish,"Clin Microbiol Rev. 2009 Apr;22(2):186-201, Table of Contents. doi: 10.1128/CMR.00052-08.",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The last few decades have seen a dramatic increase in the global burden of dengue, with the virus now being endemic or near-endemic in over 100 countries world-wide. A recombinant tetravalent vaccine candidate (CYD-TDV) has recently completed Phase III clinical efficacy trials in South East Asia and Latin America and has been licensed for use in several countries. The trial results showed moderate-to-high efficacies in protection against clinical symptoms and hospitalisation but with so far unknown effects on transmission and infections per se. Model-based predictions about the vaccine's short- or long-term impact on the burden of dengue are therefore subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, different immune interactions between dengue's serotypes have frequently been evoked by modelling studies to underlie dengue's oscillatory dynamics in disease incidence and serotype prevalence. Here we show how model assumptions regarding immune interactions in the form of antibody-dependent enhancement, temporary cross-immunity and the number of infections required to develop full immunity can significantly affect the predicted outcome of a dengue vaccination campaign. Our results thus re-emphasise the important gap in our current knowledge concerning the effects of previous exposure on subsequent dengue infections and further suggest that intervention impact studies should be critically evaluated by their underlying assumptions about serotype immune-interactions.","['Lourenco, Jose', 'Recker, Mario']","['Lourenco J', 'Recker M']",,"['Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3PS, UK.', 'Centre for Mathematics and the Environment, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9EZ, UK.

The first dengue viruses were isolated about 50 years ago. Prior to the 1950's, dengue was considered a mild febrile disease, though rare hemorrhagic and fatal cases were known to occur. After that date, the first epidemics of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) appeared in Southeast Asia, and DHF became the most important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in the region. The emergence of DHF epidemics was first explained by mutations affecting dengue viruses, making them more virulent, but this hypothesis was not retained. Then, the ""secondary infection"" or ""immune enhancement"" theory was proposed to explain the increased virulence of dengue viruses when children had a secondary infection. This second hypothesis is still actually favoured. However, observations in Southeast Asia, some Pacific islands, and Americas do not agree with the ""secondary infection"" hypothesis, which consequently has been modified several times. Recent advances in molecular biology have led to the recognition that some viral strains are more virulent than others. Another hypothesis is the selection of more virulent dengue strains by the new vector Ae. aegypti, replacing the local vector Ae. albopictus, when urbanization and modern transportation increased in Southeast Asia after the last war. Comparisons between epidemics are very difficult, because of the distinction between DHF cases according to WHO criteria and dengue fever (DF) cases with hemorrhages. This distinction has no pathogenic or prognostic grounds, and makes the task of clinicians more difficult. The actual situation in countries facing dengue epidemics makes clear that this disease will continue to be a public health problem for some time to come.","['Rosen, L']",['Rosen L'],,['Institut Pasteur de Guyane.'],['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,France,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique (1990),9212564,,IM,"['Asia, Southeastern/epidemiology', '*Dengue/epidemiology/history/virology', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans']",,1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 1996;89(2):91-3; discussion 93-4.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each year, up to 400 million people get infected with dengue virus. It is one of the most important arthropod-borne viral diseases. Dengue's global presence poses a medical threat to deploying military personnel and their dependents. An accurate diagnosis followed by attentive supportive care can improve outcomes in patients with severe dengue disease. Dengue diagnostic tests based on PCR and ELISA platforms have been developed and cleared by the U.S. FDA. However, these diagnostic assays are laborious and usually require highly trained personnel and specialized equipment, which presents a significant challenge when conducting operations in austere and resource-constrained areas. InBios International, Inc. (Seattle, WA) has developed two rapid and instrument-free immunochromatographic test prototype devices (multiplex and traditional formats) for dengue diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the performance of the InBios immunochromatographic tests, 183 clinical samples were tested on both prototype devices. Both assays were performed without any instruments and the results were read in 20 minutes. RESULTS: The traditional format had better overall performance (sensitivity: 97.4%; specificity: 90%) than the multiplex format (sensitivity: 86.9%; specificity: 63.3%). The traditional format was superior in serotype-specific detection with 100% overall sensitivity for DENV1, DENV3, and DENV4 and 93.3% sensitivity for DENV2 compared to the multiplex format (91.7%, 78.3%, 83.3%, and 96.3% for DENV1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). The traditional format was easier to read than the multiplex format. The multiplex format was simpler and faster to set up than the traditional format. CONCLUSIONS: The InBios traditional format had a better overall performance and readability profile than the multiplex format, while the multiplex format was easier to set up. Both formats were highly sensitive and specific, were easy to perform, and did not require sophisticated equipment. They are ideal for use in resource-limited settings where dengue is endemic. Based on our overall assessment, the traditional format should be considered for further development and used in the upcoming multicenter clinical trial toward FDA clearance.","['Chen, Hua-Wei', 'Maldonado, Tania D', 'Lee, Cheng-Rei', 'Williams, Maya', 'Defang, Gabriel N', 'Ellison, Damon W', 'Van De Wyngaerde, Marshall', 'Rooney, Calli M', 'Wu, Shuenn-Jue L']","['Chen HW', 'Maldonado TD', 'Lee CR', 'Williams M', 'Defang GN', 'Ellison DW', 'Van De Wyngaerde M', 'Rooney CM', 'Wu SL']",,"['Viral and Rickettsial Diseases Department, Naval Medical Research Center, Silver Spring, MD 20910, USA.', 'Viral and Rickettsial Diseases Department, Naval Medical Research Center, Silver Spring, MD 20910, USA.', 'Viral and Rickettsial Diseases Department, Naval Medical Research Center, Silver Spring, MD 20910, USA.', 'Viral and Rickettsial Diseases Department, Naval Medical Research Center, Silver Spring, MD 20910, USA.', 'Viral and Rickettsial Diseases Department, Naval Medical Research Center, Silver Spring, MD 20910, USA.', 'Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD 20910, USA.', 'Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD 20910, USA.', 'U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity, Fort Detrick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Viral and Rickettsial Diseases Department, Naval Medical Research Center, Silver Spring, MD 20910, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Mil Med,Military medicine,2984771R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral', '*Dengue/diagnosis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Humans', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2021/01/12 06:00,2022/05/10 06:00,['2021/01/11 17:11'],"['2020/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/10 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/11 17:11 [entrez]']","['6080202 [pii]', '10.1093/milmed/usaa553 [doi]']",ppublish,Mil Med. 2022 May 3;187(5-6):e655-e660. doi: 10.1093/milmed/usaa553.,5-6,"['(c) The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2021.

We conducted a qualitative regional case study, consisting of semi-structured expert interviews and observational data, covering the urban region of Hyderabad in South India. Our findings indicate that Hyderabad's dengue surveillance system predominantly relies on public reporting units, neglecting India's large private health sector. The surveillance system requires further strengthening and additional efforts to efficiently integrate existing governmental initiatives at all geographical levels and administrative boundaries. We concluded with recommendations for improved consistency, accuracy, efficiency and reduction of system fragmentation to enhance the integration of dengue surveillance and improved health information in urban India.

However, in 2017, there was a noticeable reduction in reported dengue incidence cases within the Americas, including severe and fatal cases. Understanding the mechanism underlying dengue's incidence and decline in the Americas is vital for public health planning. We aimed to provide plausible explanations for the decline in 2017. METHODS: An expert panel of representatives from scientific and academic institutions, Ministry of Health officials from Latin America and PAHO/WHO staff met in October 2017 to propose hypotheses. The meeting employed six moderated plenary discussions in which participants reviewed epidemiological evidence, suggested explanatory hypotheses, offered their expert opinions on each and developed a consensus. RESULTS: The expert group established that in 2017, there was a generalised decreased incidence, severity and number of deaths due to dengue in the Americas, accompanied by a reduction in reported cases of both Zika and chikungunya virus infections, with no change in distribution among age groups affected. This decline was determined to be unlikely due to changes in epidemiological surveillance systems, as similar designs of surveillance systems exist across the region. Although sudden surveillance disruption is possible at a country or regional level, it is unlikely to occur in all countries simultaneously. Retrospective modelling with epidemiological, immunological and entomological information is needed. Host or immunological factors may have influenced the decline in dengue cases at the population level through immunity; however, herd protection requires additional evidence. Uncertainty remains regarding the effect on the outcome of sequential infections of different dengue virus (DENV) types and Zika virus (ZIKV), and vice versa. Future studies were recommended that examine the epidemiological effect of prior DENV infection on Zika incidence and severity, the epidemiological effect of prior Zika virus infection on dengue incidence and severity, immune correlates based on new-generation ELISA assays, and impact of prior DENV/other arbovirus infection on ZIKV immune response in relation to number of infections and the duration of antibodies in relation to interval of protection. Follow-up studies should also investigate whether increased vector control intensification activities contributed to the decline in transmission of one or more of these arboviruses. Additionally, proposed studies should focus on the potential role of vector competence when simultaneously exposed to various arboviruses, and on entomological surveillance and its impact on circulating vector species, with a goal of applying specific measures that mitigate seasonal occurrence or outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: Multifactorial events may have accounted for the decline in dengue seen in 2017. Differing elements might explain the reduction in dengue including elements of immunity, increased vector control, and even vector and\or viruses changes or adaptations. Most of the results of this expert consensus group meeting are hypothetical and based on limited evidence. Further studies are needed.","['Perez, Freddy', 'Llau, Anthony', 'Gutierrez, Gamaliel', 'Bezerra, Haroldo', 'Coelho, Giovanini', 'Ault, Steven', 'Barbiratto, Sulamita Brandao', 'de Resende, Marcelo Carballo', 'Cerezo, Lizbeth', 'Kleber, Giovanni Luz', 'Pacheco, Oscar', 'Perez, Octavio Lenin', 'Picos, Victor', 'Rojas, Diana P', 'Siqueira, Joao Bosco', 'Suarez, Marco Fidel', 'Harris, Eva', 'Castellanos, Luis Gerardo', 'Espinal, Carlos', 'Martin, Jose Luis San']","['Perez F', 'Llau A', 'Gutierrez G', 'Bezerra H', 'Coelho G', 'Ault S', 'Barbiratto SB', 'de Resende MC', 'Cerezo L', 'Kleber GL', 'Pacheco O', 'Perez OL', 'Picos V', 'Rojas DP', 'Siqueira JB', 'Suarez MF', 'Harris E', 'Castellanos LG', 'Espinal C', 'Martin JLS']",,"['Communicable Diseases and Environmental Determinants of Health Department, PAHO, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Robert Stempel College of Public Health and Social Work, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Neglected, Tropical and Vector-borne Diseases, PAHO, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Neglected, Tropical and Vector-borne Diseases, PAHO, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Neglected, Tropical and Vector-borne Diseases, PAHO, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA.', 'National Dengue Control Program, Ministry of Health, Brasilia, Brazil.', 'Department of Parasitology, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'National Epidemiology Department, Ministry of Health of Panama, Panama City, Panama.', 'Departamento de Infectologia, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte Hospital, Natal, Brazil.', 'Public Health Prevention and Surveillance, Ministry of Health, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Dengue Program, Ministry of Health, Managua, Nicaragua.', 'Research Laboratory of Dengue and other Viral Diseases, Ministry of Health, Maracay, Venezuela.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Federal University of Goias, Goiania, Brazil.', 'Universidad Mayor de San Andres, La Paz, Bolivia.', 'Center for Global Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Neglected, Tropical and Vector-borne Diseases, PAHO, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Robert Stempel College of Public Health and Social Work, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Neglected, Tropical and Vector-borne Diseases, PAHO, Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190128,England,Trop Med Int Health,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,9610576,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Central America/epidemiology', 'Chikungunya Fever/epidemiology/virology', 'Chikungunya virus', 'Consensus', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/immunology/virology', '*Dengue Virus/immunology', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Vectors', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'North America/epidemiology', 'South America/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Zika Virus', 'Zika Virus Infection/epidemiology/virology']",PMC6850595,2019/01/10 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2019/01/10 06:00'],"['2019/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['TMI13200 [pii]', '10.1111/tmi.13200 [doi]']",ppublish,Trop Med Int Health. 2019 Apr;24(4):442-453. doi: 10.1111/tmi.13200.

This study sought to estimate the economic costs of dengue in this Small Island Developing State of 417,492 residents. The authors reviewed relevant available documents on dengue epidemiology and conducted site visits and interviews with public health offices, health centers, referral hospitals, health insurers, and drug distribution organizations. An average of 1,543 symptomatic dengue cases was reported annually from 2011 through 2016. Intensive waste and water management on a resort island cost $1.60 per occupied room night. Local vector control programs on inhabited islands cost $35.93 for waste collection and $7.89 for household visits by community health workers per person per year. Ambulatory care for a dengue episode cost $49.87 at a health center, while inpatient episodes averaged $127.74 at a health center, $1,164.78 at a regional hospital, and $1,655.50 at a tertiary referral hospital. Overall, the cost of dengue illness in the Maldives in 2015 was $2,495,747 (0.06% of gross national income, GNI, or $6.10 per resident) plus $1,338,141 (0.03% of GNI or $3.27 per resident) for dengue surveillance. With tourism generating annual income of $898 and tax revenues of $119 per resident, results of an international analysis suggest that the risk of dengue lowers the country's gross annual income by $110 per resident (95% confidence interval $50 to $160) and its annual tax receipts by $14 per resident (95% confidence interval $7 to $22). Many innovative vector control efforts are affordable and could decrease future costs of dengue illness in the Maldives.","['Bangert, Mathieu', 'Latheef, Aishath Thimna', 'Dev Pant, Shushil', 'Nishan Ahmed, Ibrahim', 'Saleem, Sana', 'Nazla Rafeeq, Fathimath', 'Abdulla, Moomina', 'Shamah, Fathimath', 'Jamsheed Mohamed, Ahmed', 'Fitzpatrick, Christopher', 'Velayudhan, Raman', 'Shepard, Donald S']","['Bangert M', 'Latheef AT', 'Dev Pant S', 'Nishan Ahmed I', 'Saleem S', 'Nazla Rafeeq F', 'Abdulla M', 'Shamah F', 'Jamsheed Mohamed A', 'Fitzpatrick C', 'Velayudhan R', 'Shepard DS']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1320-8145', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2187-0593']","['Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'World Health Organization Country Office, Male, Republic of Maldives.', 'World Health Organization Country Office, Male, Republic of Maldives.', 'Health Protection Agency, Ministry of Health, Male, Republic of Maldives.', 'Health Protection Agency, Ministry of Health, Male, Republic of Maldives.', 'Health Protection Agency, Ministry of Health, Male, Republic of Maldives.', 'Policy Planning and International Health, Ministry of Health, Male, Republic of Maldives.', 'Policy Planning and International Health, Ministry of Health, Male, Republic of Maldives.', 'Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases, World Health Organization Regional Office for South East Asia, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Schneider Institutes for Health Policy, Heller School for Social Policy and Management, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180927,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Communicable Disease Control/*economics', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/prevention & control', '*Disease Management', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious/*prevention & control', '*Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Indian Ocean Islands/epidemiology']",PMC6177194,2018/09/28 06:00,2019/01/15 06:00,['2018/09/28 06:00'],"['2018/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/09/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['PNTD-D-18-00848 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0006796 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2018 Sep 27;12(9):e0006796. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006796. eCollection 2018 Sep.,9,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,['001/WHO_/World Health Organization/International'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dengue fever is usually transmitted by Aedes aegypti. It is due to an arbovirus-flavivirus of which four different serotypes are known: Den 1 to 4. Each serotype is responsible for specific prolonged immunity but no cross-reactivity exists between serotypes. Clinically, the onset is abrupt with frontal headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, joint pain, prostration and, in many cases, a macular rash usually sparing the face and extremities. Haemorrhagic signs may occur, such as petechiae, purpura, epistaxis or bleeding gingivae. Two severe forms of dengue fever, particularly among children below 3 years of age, include dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and DHF with shock (dengue shock syndrome). If a case is suspected in metropolitan France, the diagnosis should be systematically confirmed by positive specific IgM, RT-PCR or viral isolation. Treatment of dengue fever, whether in its uncomplicated form or with hemorrhagic manifestations or shock, remains symptomatic. There is no specific anti-viral treatment. A case should be notified to allow French health authorities to take the appropriate measures for vector control.","['Dellamonica, P']",['Dellamonica P'],,"['Universite de Nice-Sophia-Antipolis, Service Infectiologie, Hopital Archet 1, CHU de Nice, BP 3079, 06202 NICE cedex 3, France. dellamonica.p@chu-nice.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,France,Arch Pediatr,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,9421356,['0 (Antiviral Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aedes/virology', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/epidemiology/immunology/transmission', 'Disease Notification', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Severe Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology/immunology/transmission']",,2009/10/20 06:00,2010/01/09 06:00,['2009/10/20 06:00'],"['2009/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0929-693X(09)75306-0 [pii]', '10.1016/S0929-693X(09)75306-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pediatr. 2009 Oct;16 Suppl 2:S80-4. doi: 10.1016/S0929-693X(09)75306-0.,,,,,,,,,,La dengue: aspects cliniques.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before 2004, in order to cope with the surge in adult dengue admissions, each of the six medical wards in a university hospital took turns daily to admit and manage patients with dengue. Despite regular in-house training, the implementation of the WHO 1997 dengue case management guidelines by the multiple medical teams was piecemeal and resulted in high variability of care. A restructuring of adult dengue inpatient service in 2004 resulted in all patients being admitted to one ward under the care of the infectious disease unit. Hospital and Intensive Care Unit admission criteria, discharge criteria and clinical laboratory testing were maintained unchanged throughout the study period. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of cohorting adult dengue patients on the quality of care and the clinical outcome in a university hospital in Malaysia. METHODS: A pre (2003) and post-intervention (2005-6) retrospective study was undertaken. INTERVENTION: Cohorting all dengue patients under the care of the Infectious Disease team in a designated ward in 2004. RESULTS: The number of patients enrolled was 352 in 2003, 785 in 2005 and 1158 in 2006. The evaluation and detection of haemorrhage remained high (>90%) and unchanged throughout the study period. The evaluation of plasma leakage increased from 35.4% pre-intervention to 78.8% post-intervention (p = <0.001) while its detection increased from 11.4% to 41.6% (p = <0.001). Examination for peripheral perfusion was undertaken in only 13.1% of patients pre-intervention, with a significant increase post-intervention, 18.6% and 34.2% respectively, p = <0.001. Pre-intervention, more patients had hypotension (21.5%) than detected peripheral hypoperfusion (11.4%), indicating that clinicians recognised shock only when patients developed hypotension. In contrast, post-intervention, clinicians recognised peripheral hypoperfusion as an early sign of shock. The highest haematocrit was significantly higher post-intervention but the lowest total white cell counts and platelet counts remained unchanged. A significant and progressive reduction in the use of platelet transfusions occurred, from 21.7% pre-intervention to 14.6% in 2005 and 5.2% in 2006 post-intervention, p<0.001. Likewise, the use of plasma transfusion decreased significantly from 6.1% pre-intervention to 4.0% and 1.6% in the post-intervention years of 2005 and 2006 respectively, p<0.001. The duration of intravenous fluid therapy decreased from 3 days pre-intervention to 2.5 days (p<0.001) post-intervention; the length of hospital stay reduced from 4 days pre- to 3 days (p<0.001) post-intervention and the rate of intensive care admission from 5.8% pre to 2.6% and 2.5% post-intervention, p = 0.005. CONCLUSION: Cohorting adult dengue patients under a dedicated and trained team of doctors and nurses led to a substantial improvement in quality of care and clinical outcome.","['Lum, Lucy C S', 'Syed Omar, Sharifah Faridah', 'Sri La Sri Ponnampalavanar, Sasheela', 'Tan, Lian H', 'Sekaran, Shamala Devi', 'Kamarulzaman, Adeeba']","['Lum LC', 'Syed Omar SF', 'Sri La Sri Ponnampalavanar S', 'Tan LH', 'Sekaran SD', 'Kamarulzaman A']",,"['Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medicine, Sunway Medical Centre, Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150605,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dengue/*classification/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Patient Care/*methods', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4457480,2015/06/06 06:00,2016/02/10 06:00,['2015/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['PNTD-D-14-02226 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0003836 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015 Jun 5;9(6):e0003836. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003836. eCollection 2015 Jun.,6,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two dengue vaccine candidates are in advanced clinical efficacy trials in Latin America and Asia, and another has been licensed in more than fifteen countries but its uptake has been limited. Despite these advances, standardized metrics for comparability of protective efficacy between dengue vaccines remain poorly defined. The Dengue Illness Index (DII) is a tool that we developed thru refinement of previous similar iterations in an attempt to improve and standardize the measurement of vaccine and drug efficacy in reducing moderate dengue illness. The tool is designed to capture an individual's overall disease experience based on how the totality of their symptoms impacts their general wellness and daily functionality. We applied the DII to a diary card, the Dengue Illness Card (DIC), which was examined and further developed by a working group. The card was then refined with feedback garnered from a Delphi methodology-based query that addressed the adequacy and applicability of the tool in clinical dengue research. There was overall agreement that the tool would generate useful data and provide an alternative perspective to the assessment of drug or vaccine candidates, which in the case of vaccines, are assessed by their reduction in any virologically confirmed dengue of any severity with a focus on the more severe. The DIC needs to be evaluated in the field in the context of vaccine or drug trials, prospective cohort studies, or during experimental human infection studies. Here, we present the final DIC resulting from the Delphi process and offer its further development or use to the dengue research community.","['Thomas, Stephen J', 'Agulto, Liane', 'Hendrickx, Kim', 'Erpicum, Martin', 'Tomashek, Kay M', 'Cassetti, M Cristina', 'Laughlin, Catherine', 'Precioso, Alexander', 'Schmidt, Alexander C', 'Narvaez, Federico', 'Siqueira, Joao Bosco', 'Tissera, Hasitha', 'Edelman, Robert']","['Thomas SJ', 'Agulto L', 'Hendrickx K', 'Erpicum M', 'Tomashek KM', 'Cassetti MC', 'Laughlin C', 'Precioso A', 'Schmidt AC', 'Narvaez F', 'Siqueira JB', 'Tissera H', 'Edelman R']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8657-9292'],"['Division of Infectious Diseases, State University of New York, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, United States of America.', 'Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD, United States of America.', 'FWO Postdoctoral Fellow of the Life Sciences & Society Lab, Center for Sociological Research, KU Leuven, Flanders, Belgium.', 'SPIRAL Research Center, Departement de Science Politique, Universite de Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'SPIRAL Research Center, Departement de Science Politique, Universite de Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD, United States of America.', 'Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD, United States of America.', 'Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD, United States of America.', 'Division of Clinical Trials and Pharmacovigilance, Butantan Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Pediatrics Department of the Medical School of University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'GSK Vaccines, Rockville, MD, United States of America.', 'Infectious Diseases Unit, National Pediatric Reference Hospital, Hospital Infantil Manuel de Jesus Rivera, Managua, Nicaragua.', 'Federal University of Goias, Brasilia, Brazil.', 'National Dengue Control Unit, Ministry of Health, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Center for Vaccine Development, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181004,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology/prevention & control', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Humans', 'Prospective Studies', '*Severity of Illness Index', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6171819,2018/10/05 06:00,2019/01/10 06:00,['2018/10/05 06:00'],"['2017/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['PNTD-D-17-01608 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0006593 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2018 Oct 4;12(10):e0006593. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006593. eCollection 2018 Oct.,10,,,,"[""I have read the journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript have the"", 'following competing interests: at the time of the submission, AS was an employee', 'of GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines and holds shares related to this employment status.']","['Development of Standard Clinical Endpoints for Use in Dengue Interventional', 'Trials.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has been caused by increased frequency of epidemic activity in most countries, as a result of increased numbers of virus serotypes circulating in the region. The change in disease ecology has resulted in the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) in the region, first with a major epidemic in Cuba, followed by increased occurrence of sporadic cases of DHF/DSS in many countries. The sequence of events in the Americas in the 1980's has been nearly identical to the pattern observed in Southeast Asia in the 1950's. Prospects for prevention of epidemic DHF/DSS in the American region, therefore, are not good.

Immature platelet fraction (IPF), which can be measured using a haematology analyser, is a precursor indicating platelet formation in the bone marrow. This study evaluated the trend of IPF as an early recovery indicator of platelets in dengue patients with thrombocytopenia, and its relationship with severe dengue in conjunction with reticulocyte count. METHODS: Hospitalized patients with dengue were enrolled and followed-up daily until discharge. Blood investigations included daily full blood counts and IPF measured using a haematology analyser. RESULTS: In total, 287 patients with confirmed dengue were enrolled in this study, 25 of whom had severe dengue. All patients had a decreasing trend in platelet count in the first week of illness, concomitant with an increasing trend in the percentage of immature platelets to total platelets (IPF%) for more than 3 days prior to platelet recovery. IPF% was significantly increased in patients with severe dengue compared with patients with non-severe dengue on days 3-5 after the onset of fever. Reticulocyte count increased significantly in patients with severe dengue on day 5.

Like other regions, dengue-endemic areas have faced the additional public health and socio-economic impact of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 and dengue co-infections have been reported, with complicated patient management and care requirements. This review aimed to collate and synthesise current knowledge on the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 and dengue virus co-infection, a potentially important new dimension to be considered in public health management of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases from 1st January to 21st November 2020. The key search terms used were ""dengue"" and ""coronavirus"". Descriptive analysis with graphical illustrations were used to present the clinical and laboratory parameters of the co-infection. RESULTS: Thirteen published papers and four news articles were included in the review. Most studies were case reports with a detailed description of the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the co-infection. All cases were in adults with the exception of a six-year old child. The common symptoms of co-infection were fever, dyspnea, headache, and cough. Common laboratory results included thrombocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, elevated transaminases, and leukopenia. Serious outcomes of co-infection included septic shock, acute respiratory disease syndrome and multi-organ failure, leading to death in some patients. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 and dengue co-infection was associated with severe disease and fatal outcomes. The correct diagnosis and treatment of co-infection poses a substantial challenge due to the overlapping clinical and laboratory parameters. Therefore, confirmative diagnostic tests are necessary for accurate and timely diagnosis and patient management.","['Tsheten, Tsheten', 'Clements, Archie C A', 'Gray, Darren J', 'Adhikary, Ripon K', 'Wangdi, Kinley']","['Tsheten T', 'Clements ACA', 'Gray DJ', 'Adhikary RK', 'Wangdi K']",,"['Research School of Population Health, College of Health and Medicine, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia. tsheten.tsheten@anu.edu.au.', 'Royal Centre for Disease Control, Ministry of Health, Thimphu, Bhutan. tsheten.tsheten@anu.edu.au.', 'Telethon Kids Institute, Nedlands, Australia.', 'Curtin University, Perth, Australia.', 'Research School of Population Health, College of Health and Medicine, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.', 'Research School of Population Health, College of Health and Medicine, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.', 'Research School of Population Health, College of Health and Medicine, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20210802,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,,IM,"['Adult', '*COVID-19', 'Child', '*Coinfection/epidemiology', '*Dengue/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Pandemics', 'SARS-CoV-2']",PMC8327042,2021/08/04 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2021/08/03 05:34'],"['2021/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/03 05:34 [entrez]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-021-06409-9 [pii]', '6409 [pii]', '10.1186/s12879-021-06409-9 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2021 Aug 2;21(1):729. doi: 10.1186/s12879-021-06409-9.,1,['(c) 2021.

Emerging reports of dengue virus infections in Europe create a new epidemic problem. The virus responsible for causing the symptoms of the disease is transmitted by mosquitoes. Over 50% of the world's population lives in areas where the risk of dengue feveris high. In total, according to WHO, infected with dengue is 2.4 million people and outbreaks of endemic diseases are present in 100 countries that threaten the 2.5 billion population. There are four serotypes of dengue virus, which belong to the family Flaviviridae and the type of Flavirus. Serotypes are known as DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. Contact each of the serotypes of the virus causes long-lasting resistance to the other, and each of them is responsible for the induction of disease epidemics, including severe cases. In the first stage of the disease should seek to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Because of the elevated body temperature is recommended to administer paracetamol formulations and the use of cold compresses. Contraindicated is the use of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In severe forms of dengue patients absolutely should be hospitalized and treatment in the intensive care centers. In the treatment of shock, it is recommended that the administration of isotonic crystalloid fluids at 5-10 ml/kg/hr. under the control of hematocrit and fill peripheral microcirculation. The administration of blood products for the large current is required to control bleeding. Dengue vaccine containing DEN-DEN chimeras is still at the stage of preclinical studies.","['Plusa, Tadeusz']",['Plusa T'],,,['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Poland,Pol Merkur Lekarski,Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,9705469,,IM,"['Animals', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*immunology/therapy/transmission', 'Disease Outbreaks/statistics & numerical data', 'Disease Vectors', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Humans', 'Serotyping']",,2014/12/31 06:00,2015/02/07 06:00,['2014/12/31 06:00'],"['2014/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pol Merkur Lekarski. 2014 Nov;37(221):305-10.,221,,,,,,,,,Wspolczesne immunologiczne i kliniczne uwarunkowania zakazenia wirusem dengi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this retrospective study, conducted in a tertiary care centre in south India, we sought to describe the spectrum of NMs of dengue fever. The records of all patients admitted in the Department of Internal Medicine over 8 years, with a diagnosis of dengue-based on clinical symptoms and the detection of dengue IgM antibodies or detection of NS1 antigen or nucleic acid by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); with Glasgow coma score (GCS) </=14, neck stiffness, focal neurological signs, seizures, or visual disturbances-were explored. RESULTS: Of 1121 patients admitted with dengue fever, 341 (30%) had severe dengue and 23 (2%) had NMs. Encephalopathy was seen in 9 patients (39%), encephalitis in 6 (27%), cerebellitis in 4 (17%), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in 2 (9%), ischaemic stroke in 1 (4%) patient, and neuro-ophthalmological manifestations in 1 (4%) patient. The median duration of hospital stay was 7 days. Nine (39% of) patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 5 (22%) had fatal outcomes. There was no association between thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, transaminitis, hyponatremia, the type of dengue infection, and the various NMs described.

Dengue is an acute mosquito-transmitted viral disease characterised by fever, headache, muscle and joint pains, rash, nausea, and vomiting. Some infections result in dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), a syndrome that in its most severe form can threaten the patient's life, primarily through increased vascular permeability and shock. The case fatality rate in patients with dengue shock syndrome can be as high as 44%. For decades, two distinct hypotheses to explain the mechanism of DHF have been debated-secondary infection or viral virulence. However, a combination of both now seems to be the plausible explanation. The geographical expansion of DHF presents the need for well-documented clinical, epidemiological, and virological descriptions of the syndrome in the Americas. Biological and social research are essential to develop effective mosquito control, medications to reduce capillary leakage, and a safe tetravalent vaccine.","['Rigau-Perez, J G', 'Clark, G G', 'Gubler, D J', 'Reiter, P', 'Sanders, E J', 'Vorndam, A V']","['Rigau-Perez JG', 'Clark GG', 'Gubler DJ', 'Reiter P', 'Sanders EJ', 'Vorndam AV']",,"['Dengue Branch, Division of Vector-borne Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00921-3200, USA.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) is the most recently impacted province. This study aimed to investigate the molecular, epidemiological, and potential elements that contribute to increasing dengue transmission patterns, and knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) toward dengue in KP province. METHOD: This cross-sectional community-based study was conducted (June-December, 2021) in two phases. Phase I involved the epidemiological (n = 5,242) and molecular analysis of DENV in 500 randomly collected blood samples of the 2021 dengue outbreak in KP. Phase II focused on assessing dengue-KAP levels in healthy communities (n = 14,745, aged >18 years), adopting a cross-sectional clustered multistage sampling in eight districts (dengue-hotspot vs. non-hotspot) of KP. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis were applied. RESULTS: Peshawar district had the highest dengue cases (60.0%) associated with the predominant co-circulation of DENV-2 (45.8%) and DENV-3 (50.4%) serotypes. A rise in cases was reported in October (41.8%) followed by September (27.9%) and August (14.4%; p < 0.001). Males (63.7%, p < 0.001) and individuals aged 16-30 years (37.0%, p < 0.001) were highly affected. General workers (18.0%), families with a monthly income of 10,000-20,000 Pak rupees (50.5%), unmarried (71.0%), uneducated (31%), families with higher human density (>10 individuals per household), and those (29.0%) who faced power outages for more than 7/24 h were the most affected. Moreover, co-morbidities like renal failure and bronchial asthma were associated with disease severity. A community survey on KAP revealed that an average of 74, 60, and 43% of the participants demonstrated good knowledge, attitudes, and dengue preventive practices, respectively. CONCLUSION: Multiple poor socioeconomic elements are influencing dengue fever transmission in the province. Higher KAP levels may explain the low frequency of dengue in non-hotspot districts. Our study emphasizes the need for effective and long-term public health education, strengthened vector surveillance, and expanded laboratory capacity for better diagnosis and management of dengue cases to better predict the burden and seasonality of disease in the country.","['Khan, Jehangir', 'Adil, Muhammad', 'Wang, Gang', 'Tsheten, Tsheten', 'Zhang, Dongjing', 'Pan, Wenjie', 'Khan, Munir

The disease is caused by four closely related dengue serotypes; it ranges from asymptomatic infection to undifferentiated fever, dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). DHF is characterized by fever, bleeding diathesis and a tendency to develop apotentially fatal shock syndrome. Dengue infection with organ impairment mainly involves the central nervous system and liver. Consistent hematological findings include vasculopathy, coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. Laboratory diagnoses include virus isolation, serology, and detection ofdengue ribonucleic acid. Successful treatment, which is mainly supportive, depends on early recognition of the disease and careful monitoring for shock. A severity-based revised dengue classification for medical interventions has been developed and validated in many countries. So far however, there has not been any specific dengue treatment; prevention is currently limited to vector control measures. The world's first, large-scale dengue vaccine, efficacy study demonstrated its efficacy and a reduction of dengue's severity in a study of more than 10,000 volunteers in Asia.

The last DEN-1 epidemic reached 16 PICTs and in some of them it affected as much as 20 per cent of the population, aside from the massive impact on their fragile economies. Dengue is mostly introduced into PICTs from global travel, and many experts believe that it has a 3-4 year cyclical pattern of occurrence. All four virus serotypes (DEN-1, 2, 3 and 4) have caused epidemics, but those caused by DEN-1 and 2 have been somewhat larger. In light of this, dengue rightly remains a priority for the Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network (PPHSN). The paper updates the situation regarding dengue outbreaks in PICTs over the last four decades, describes the pattern of presentations in the recent past, and provides an update on the potential risk to PICTs for the near future. It follows on from an earlier dengue update written in 1998. The utility of PPHSN services is also demonstrated in the paper: PacNet for alerts and communication about dengue outbreaks (raising awareness and preparedness levels in the region) and LabNet for investigations relating to dengue. Creative interventions towards dengue control and prevention are being tried in PICTs and early assessment and evaluations of their effectiveness in the field are being examined.","['Singh, Narendra', 'Kiedrzynski, Tom', 'Lepers, Christelle', 'Benyon, Elise Kamisan']","['Singh N', 'Kiedrzynski T', 'Lepers C', 'Benyon EK']",,"['Secretariat of the Pacific Community, Noumea, New Caledonia. narendras@spc.int']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Pac Health Dialog,Pacific health dialog,9434923,,IM,"['Animals', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Dengue Virus/classification/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Insect Vectors', 'Pacific Islands/epidemiology']",,2008/01/10 09:00,2008/02/22 09:00,['2008/01/10 09:00'],"['2008/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pac Health Dialog. 2005 Sep;12(2):111-9.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite its commonness, dengue fever has rarely been described among patients who have undergone transplantation. We report the case of a patient with dengue fever after liver transplantation, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first such reported case outside Brazil. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 46-year-old Sri Lakan man who presented to our institution two years after undergoing an ABO-compatible cadaveric liver transplant. At presentation, he had typical symptoms of dengue fever. He was taking prednisolone 5mg daily and tacrolimus 3mg twice daily as immunosuppression. Initial investigations showed thrombocytopenia and neutropenia that reached a nadir by day 7 of his illness. He had elevated liver enzymes as well. The diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of NS1 antigen detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. His blood cultures and polymerase chain reaction tests for cytomegalovirus were negative. He made an uneventful recovery and was discharged by day 9 of his illness. However, normalization of liver function took nearly two weeks. In three previously reported Brazilian cases of dengue after liver transplantation, the patients presented with dengue shock syndrome, in contrast to the relatively milder presentation of our patient. Because of the lack of case reports in the literature, it is difficult to ascertain the risk factors for severe dengue infection in transplants, but dengue fever reported in renal transplants sheds some light on them. High-dose steroids increase the risk of thrombocytopenia, whereas tacrolimus has been reported to prolong the duration of symptoms. Otherwise, dengue fever is a relatively mild illness in patients who have undergone renal transplantation, and renal allograft survival has been reported to be 86% following dengue fever. CONCLUSION: Dengue is a rarely reported infection in patients who have undergone transplantation. A high degree of suspicion is required for diagnosis. Dengue NS1 antigen detection is a useful addition to the already existing methods of diagnosis. Steroids and tacrolimus have effects on the morbidity of the disease. Graft outcomes following the infection has been excellent in all reported cases.","['Weerakkody, Ranga Migara', 'Palangasinghe, Dhammika Randula', 'Dalpatadu, Kaluthanthri Patabandi Chamila', 'Rankothkumbura, Jeewan Pradeep', 'Cassim, Mohammed Rezni Nizam', 'Karunanayake, Panduka']","['Weerakkody RM', 'Palangasinghe DR', 'Dalpatadu KP', 'Rankothkumbura JP', 'Cassim MR', 'Karunanayake P']",,"['University Medical Unit, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Regent Street, Colombo 9 CO00900, Sri Lanka. rangamw2003@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20141121,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,IM,"['Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Liver Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sri Lanka/epidemiology']",PMC4244141,2014/11/22 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2014/11/22 06:00'],"['2014/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1752-1947-8-378 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-8-378 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2014 Nov 21;8:378. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-8-378.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Training data consisted of 1771 individuals from 2006-2008 admitted with dengue fever whereby 304 developed dengue haemorrhagic fever during hospitalisation. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was used to construct three types of calculators, static admission calculators and dynamic calculators that predict the risk of developing dengue haemorrhagic fever for a subsequent day (DAily Risk Tomorrow [DART]) or for any future point after a specific day since fever onset (DAily Risk Ever [DARE]). RESULTS: From 119 admission covariates, 35 were in at least one of the calculators, which reported area under the curve (AUC) values of at least 0.72. Addition of person-time data for DART improved AUC to 0.76. DARE calculators displayed a large increase in AUC to 0.79 past day 7 with the inclusion of a strong predictor, maximum temperature on day 6 since onset, indicative of a saddleback fever. CONCLUSIONS: All calculators performed well when validated with 2005 data. Addition of daily variables further improved the accuracy.

Serotypes commonly associated with neurological manifestation are DENV-2 and DENV-3. We plan to detect the serotypes related to the neurological presentation in dengue infection and its correlation with different neurological complications and outcome. METHODS: In this case-control study, consecutive dengue cases with different neurological manifestations were enrolled along with age and sex-matched controls (dengue patients without neurological complication). Serotyping using RT-PCR of samples of cases and controls were done. Level of correlation was analyzed with various parameters and outcomes. RESULTS: In cases out of 33 samples, 6 sample serotypes were detected, which were composed of DENV-1 (n = 2) and DENV-2 (n = 4). In controls, DENV-1 (n = 5), DENV-2 (n = 6), and DENV-3 (n = 3) were detected. When statistically correlated, no significant association was found in cases and controls with dengue virus serotype. The frequency of serotype 2 was higher in hypokalemic paralysis cases than non-hypokalemic paralysis cases and the difference was significant (p < 0.05). The outcome was good (mRS < 3) in all the cases where serotypes were detected, but on statistical correlation, it was not found significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: DENV-1 and DENV-2 are associated with neurological manifestation of dengue infection, which is different from the existing literature, where DENV-2 and DENV-3 are reported. The detection of DENV serotype will help in predicting and best management of neurological complication. The serotype 2 of dengue virus is more commonly associated with dengue-associated hypokalemic paralysis than other neurological complication (p < 0.05). There is no significant association of serotypes with outcome or mortality.","['Pandey, Atul', 'Verma, Rajesh', 'Jain, Amita', 'Prakash, Shantanu', 'Garg, Ravindra Kumar', 'Malhotra, Hardeep Singh', 'Sharma, Praveen Kumar', 'Kumar, Neeraj', 'Uniyal, Ravi', 'Pandey, Sweta', 'Rizvi, Imran']","['Pandey A', 'Verma R', 'Jain A', 'Prakash S', 'Garg RK', 'Malhotra HS', 'Sharma PK', 'Kumar N', 'Uniyal R', 'Pandey S', 'Rizvi I']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7016-2361'],"[""Department of Neurology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India, PIN-226003."", ""Department of Neurology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India, PIN-226003. drrajeshverma32@yahoo.com."", ""Department of Microbiology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India."", ""Department of Microbiology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India."", ""Department of Neurology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India, PIN-226003."", ""Department of Neurology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India, PIN-226003."", ""Department of Neurology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India, PIN-226003."", ""Department of Neurology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India, PIN-226003."", ""Department of Neurology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India, PIN-226003."", ""Department of Neurology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India, PIN-226003."", ""Department of Neurology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India, PIN-226003.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210802,Italy,Neurol Sci,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,100959175,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', '*Dengue/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', '*Dengue Virus', 'Humans', 'Serogroup', 'Serotyping']",,2021/08/03 06:00,2022/02/24 06:00,['2021/08/02 12:31'],"['2021/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/02 12:31 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10072-021-05477-8 [pii]', '10.1007/s10072-021-05477-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurol Sci. 2022 Mar;43(3):1939-1946. doi: 10.1007/s10072-021-05477-8.

Here we show the presence of transmission-clearance trade-offs in dengue virus using viremia measurements. By fitting a within-host model to these data, we further find that the interaction between dengue and the host immune response can account for the observed trade-offs. Finally, we consider dengue virulence evolution when selection acts on the virus's production rate. By combining within-host model simulations with empirical findings on how host viral load affects human-to-mosquito transmission success, we show that the virus's transmission potential is maximized at production rates associated with intermediate virulence and that the optimal production rate critically depends on dengue's epidemiological context. These results indicate that long-term changes in dengue's global distribution impact the invasion and spread of virulent dengue virus genotypes.","['Ben-Shachar, Rotem', 'Koelle, Katia']","['Ben-Shachar R', 'Koelle K']",,"['Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, USA. rbenshachar@gmail.com.', 'Department of Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, USA. rbenshachar@gmail.com.', 'Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA. rbenshachar@gmail.com.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA. rbenshachar@gmail.com.', 'Department of Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, USA. katia.koelle@emory.edu.', 'Department of Biology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA. katia.koelle@emory.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180615,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', '*Biological Evolution', 'Culicidae', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/transmission/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Fitness', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immune System', 'Male', 'Vietnam/epidemiology', 'Viral Load', 'Virulence/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC6003961,2018/06/17 06:00,2018/12/27 06:00,['2018/06/17 06:00'],"['2017/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-018-04595-w [pii]', '4595 [pii]', '10.1038/s41467-018-04595-w [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2018 Jun 15;9(1):2355. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-04595-w.,1,,,,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],,['U54 GM111274/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify relevant articles in 3 major databases (ProQuest, American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, and PubMed). Complete economic evaluation studies, including willingness-to-pay (WTP) studies, that were conducted in any Southeast Asian country were included in this study. Systematic review, non-full-text, and non-English studies were specifically excluded. RESULTS: Nine selected studies highlighted the economic evaluation of dengue vaccination in Southeast Asian countries by considering many parameters (eg, vaccine cost, vaccine efficacy, cost-effectiveness threshold, economic assessment, public acceptance, and WTP). All studies confirmed that dengue vaccine can be used as a prevention strategy to reduce the incidence rate of dengue cases by providing a variance of high cost-effectiveness values. In addition, communities provided a good assessment, acceptance, and WTP value for the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The use of dengue vaccine could reduce the burden of disease and economic burden due to dengue infection in Southeast Asian countries. The efficacy of dengue vaccine was estimated to be 50-95% for those <9 years, 9 years, and >9 years. In particular, several studies reported that dengue vaccine could be categorized as a cost-effective intervention in Southeast Asian countries within certain conditions.","['Supadmi, Woro', 'Suwantika, Auliya A', 'Perwitasari, Dyah A', 'Abdulah, Rizky']","['Supadmi W', 'Suwantika AA', 'Perwitasari DA', 'Abdulah R']",,"['Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; Center of Excellence in Higher Education for Pharmaceutical Care Innovation, Universitas Padjadjaran, Sumedang, Indonesia.', 'Center of Excellence in Higher Education for Pharmaceutical Care Innovation, Universitas Padjadjaran, Sumedang, Indonesia.

International travellers significantly contribute to dengue's rapid and large-scale spread by importing the disease from endemic into non-endemic countries. To prevent future outbreaks and dengue from establishing in non-endemic countries, knowledge about the arrival time and location of infected travellers is crucial. We propose a network model that predicts the monthly number of dengue-infected air passengers arriving at any given airport. We consider international air travel volumes to construct weighted networks, representing passenger flows between airports. We further calculate the probability of passengers, who travel through the international air transport network, being infected with dengue. The probability of being infected depends on the destination, duration and timing of travel. Our findings shed light onto dengue importation routes and reveal country-specific reporting rates that have been until now largely unknown. This paper provides important new knowledge about the spreading dynamics of dengue that is highly beneficial for public health authorities to strategically allocate the often limited resources to more efficiently prevent the spread of dengue.","['Liebig, Jessica', 'Jansen, Cassie', 'Paini, Dean', 'Gardner, Lauren', 'Jurdak, Raja']","['Liebig J', 'Jansen C', 'Paini D', 'Gardner L', 'Jurdak R']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9706-9420'],"['Data61, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Communicable Diseases Branch, Department of Health, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Health & Biosecurity, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia.', 'Data61, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Civil Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Data61, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191204,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Airports/*statistics & numerical data', 'Aviation/statistics & numerical data', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/transmission', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious/*statistics & numerical data', 'Human Migration/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Models, Statistical', 'Pandemics/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC6892502,2019/12/05 06:00,2020/04/01 06:00,['2019/12/05 06:00'],"['2019/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-19-13777 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0225193 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Dec 4;14(12):e0225193. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0225193. eCollection 2019.,12,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A previous study for 2006-2012 found that that projected annual number of dengue cases (5.78 million) was 282 times the officially reported number (20,474), highlighting enormous uncertainty. METHODS: This study updated primary data for India from 2012 to 2014 and synthesized the latest epidemiological and economic literature through 2018 using the country and global estimates. RESULTS: The first empirically-based publication of dengue costs by country (in 2016) estimated India experienced 18,618,706 symptomatic dengue cases and 1602 deaths, and cost $1.51 billion in 2013. With a combination of increased incidence, more refined methods, and better data this 2018 study raised the latest estimates to 53,210,706 cases, 22,527 deaths, and $5.71 billion economic costs for 2016, representing increases over the previous publication of 186%, 1306%, and 278%, respectively. When consistent methods and data were used to compare 2013 to 2016, the corresponding changes were only +29%, -9%, and +12%, respectively over these 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: India's burden of dengue is substantially greater than previously estimated. Although uncertainty intervals remain wide, these latest estimates reinforce the health and economic benefits that India would realize if dengue were substantially controlled.","['Hariharan, Dhwani', 'Das, Manoja Kumar', 'Shepard, Donald S', 'Arora, Narendra Kumar']","['Hariharan D', 'Das MK', 'Shepard DS', 'Arora NK']",,"['Heller School for Social Policy and Management, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA.

Stroke is a severe manifestation of dengue. However, few large-scale studies have investigated post-dengue risk of stroke. METHODS: This population-based cohort study included 57,934 newly diagnosed, laboratory-confirmed dengue patients in Taiwan from 2002 to 2015; patients were matched to nondengue individuals by age, sex, and area of residence at a ratio of 1:4 (n = 231,736). We used subdistribution hazard regression to evaluate short-term (</= 30 days), medium-term (31-365 days), and long-term (1-3 years) risk of stroke after DENV infection. The robustness of the results to unmeasured confounding was assessed with E-values. RESULTS: DENV infection was associated with a significantly increased risk of overall stroke (aSHR 4.51; 95% CI: 3.23-6.32; P < 0.0001; E-value = 8.49), hemorrhagic stroke (aSHR 4.13; 95% CI: 2.20-7.76; P < 0.0001; E-value =7.73), and ischemic stroke (aSHR 3.80; 95% CI: 2.37-6.11; P < 0.0001; E-value = 7.06) within 30 days. Stratified analysis by age showed that the aSHRs for overall stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and ischemic stroke were larger among dengue patients aged >/= 65 during the first 30 days. The 30-day risks of overall stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and ischemic stroke among elderly dengue patients were 6.71, 1.29, and 3.49 per 1000, respectively. No increased risk was observed after 30 days. CONCLUSION: DENV infection was associated with a significant short-term increased risk of stroke. Clinical practitioners should remain alert to patients with stroke-associated symptoms during epidemic seasons, especially elderly patients.","['Chien, Yu-Wen', 'Wang, Yu-Ping', 'Chi, Chia-Yu', 'Shih, Hsin-I']","['Chien YW', 'Wang YP', 'Chi CY', 'Shih HI']",,"['Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'National Mosquito-Borne Diseases Control Research Center, National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli County, Taiwan.

In places with strong variations in climatic conditions such as temperature and rainfall, dengue epidemics generally occur only at a certain time of the year. Where dengue is not endemic, the time of year in which imported cases enter the population plays a crucial role in determining the likelihood of outbreak occurrence. We use a mathematical model to study the effects of Wolbachia on dengue transmission dynamics and dengue seasonality. We focus in regions where dengue is not endemic but can spread due to the presence of a dengue vector and the arrival of people with dengue on a regular basis. Our results show that the time-window in which outbreaks can occur is reduced in the presence of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes by up to six weeks each year. We find that Wolbachia reduces overall case numbers by up to 80%. The strongest effect is obtained when the amplitude of the seasonal forcing is low (0.02-0.30). The benefits of Wolbachia also depend on the transmission rate, with the bacteria most effective at moderate transmission rates ranging between 0.08-0.12. Such rates are consistent with fitted estimates for Cairns, Australia.","['Ndii, Meksianis Z', 'Allingham, David', 'Hickson, R I', 'Glass, Kathryn']","['Ndii MZ', 'Allingham D', 'Hickson RI', 'Glass K']",,"['School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, The University of Newcastle, Australia; Department of Mathematics, Nusa Cendana University, Kupang-NTT, Indonesia.

Haemophilia A is the commonest inherited bleeding disorder. There is little data on the incidence and outcome of dengue in patients with haemophila. We report a case of a patient with severe haemophila A, presenting with dengue fever, managed at a tertiary care hospital in Sri Lanka. CASE PRESENTATION: A 16-year-old Sinhalese male with severe haemophilia A (factor level < 1percent) was admitted to a teaching hospital in Sri Lanka on day 1 of an acute febrile illness, associated with arthralgia, myalgia, vomiting and headache. On admission, he had a tachycardia of 120 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 110/70 millimetres of mercury, with no bleeding manifestations. Baseline investigations revealed leukocyte and platelet counts of 4400 and 241,000 per cubic millimtre, respectively, and a haematocrit of 34.5 percent. Dengue was confirmed later by sero-conversion of the dengue IgM antibody test. Fluid balance, pulse rate and blood pressure were monitored hourly. The haematocrit and platelet counts were checked thrice daily, while he was clinically assessed for bleeding. On day 3 he developed bleeding from a tooth extraction site, with vomiting of dark red blood. His platelet level at that point was 124,000 per cubic millimetre with a haematocrit of 32 percent. Intravenous factor VIII was given to achieve a 100 percent factor correction over twenty-four hours. His platelet count dropped progressively from admission to a nadir of 50,000 per cubic millimetre on day 6. He did not develop clinical evidence of fluid leakage. On day 7 he was discharged after complete recovery. CONCLUSIONS: People with haemophilia may exhibit bleeding from the early febrile stage and at higher platelet levels than most other patients with dengue. Further discussion and research is necessary to decide on the optimal management of these patients, with regard to monitoring and timely treatment with blood products and/or factor correction, in order to prevent dengue-related morbidity and mortality whilst avoiding overtreatment. In endemic areas it is advisable that such patients seek early medical help in the event of an acute fever.","['Wijayaratne, Dilushi', 'Ranasinghe, Priyanga', 'Mohotti, Shanaka P', 'Dilrukshi, Shani Apsara', 'Katulanda, Prasad']","['Wijayaratne D', 'Ranasinghe P', 'Mohotti SP', 'Dilrukshi SA', 'Katulanda P']",,"['University Medical Unit, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka. dilushi_w@yahoo.com.', 'University Medical Unit, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka. priyanga.ranasinghe@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Colombo, Sri Lanka. priyanga.ranasinghe@gmail.com.', 'University Medical Unit, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka. shanaka.mohotti@gmail.com.', 'University Medical Unit, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka. dilrukmatharage@gmail.com.', 'University Medical Unit, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka. prasad.katulanda@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Colombo, Sri Lanka. prasad.katulanda@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20150312,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Dengue/complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Hemophilia A/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male']",PMC4365964,2015/04/19 06:00,2016/01/09 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13104-015-1043-x [pii]', '1043 [pii]', '10.1186/s13104-015-1043-x [doi]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2015 Mar 12;8:78. doi: 10.1186/s13104-015-1043-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Severe dengue not fulfilling dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) criteria according to World Health Organization (WHO) 1997 guideline was increasingly reported. A new WHO 2009 guideline emphasized warning signs and a wider range of severe dengue manifestations. We aim to evaluate the utility of these two guidelines in confirmed adult dengue fatalities. METHODS: We conducted a multi-center retrospective chart review of all confirmed adult dengue deaths in Singapore from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2008. RESULTS: Of 28 adult dengue deaths, median age was 59 years. Male gender comprised 67.9% and co-morbidities existed in 75%. From illness onset, patients presented for admission at a median of 4 days and death occurred at a median of 12 days. Intensive care admission was required in 71.4%. Probable dengue was diagnosed in 32.1% by WHO 1997 criteria and 78.6% by WHO 2009. The earliest warning sign was persistent vomiting at a median of 1.5 days. Hematocrit change >/=20% concurrent with platelet count <20 x 10;9/L was associated with the shortest interval to death at a median of 3 days. Only 35.7% of death cases fulfilled DHF criteria by WHO 1997 versus severe dengue in 100.0% by WHO 2009 criteria. Deaths were due to shock and organ failure. Acute renal impairment occurred in 71.4%, impaired consciousness 57.1% and severe hepatitis 53.6%. CONCLUSIONS: In our adult fatal dengue cohort, WHO 2009 criteria had higher sensitivity in diagnosing probable dengue and severe dengue compared with WHO 1997. As warning signs, persistent vomiting occurred early and hematocrit change >/=20% concurrent with platelet count <20 x 10;9/L preceded death most closely.","['Leo, Yee-Sin', 'Thein, Tun L', 'Fisher, Dale A', 'Low, Jenny G', 'Oh, Helen M', 'Narayanan, Rajmohan L', 'Gan, Victor C', 'Lee, Vernon J', 'Lye, David C']","['Leo YS', 'Thein TL', 'Fisher DA', 'Low JG', 'Oh HM', 'Narayanan RL', 'Gan VC', 'Lee VJ', 'Lye DC']",,"['Department of Infectious Diseases, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. yee_sin_leo@ttsh.com.sg']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20110512,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Singapore/epidemiology', 'World Health Organization']",PMC3112097,2011/05/17 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['1471-2334-11-123 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2334-11-123 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2011 May 12;11:123. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-11-123.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We conducted a 6-year retrospective case note review of laboratory confirmed DF patients in East London in the period from 1 January 2010 through 31 December 2015. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of imported DF were described. Risk factors associated with viraemic DF presentations were assessed. RESULTS: Forty-four patients (4 from primary care clinics and 40 from three acute hospitals) were confirmed to have DF through RNA and/or IgM detection. In total, 86.4% (38/44) had primary infection compared to 13.6% (6/44) with secondary infection. Viraemic DF presentations accounted for 59.1% (26/44) of cases. The median age was 34 years (IQR 25-43). Most patients were males (68.2%, 30/44) and of non-white ethnicity (81.8%, 36/44). South Asia was the most frequent travel destination (52.3%, 23/44) followed by Southeast Asia (20.5%, 9/44). July-September was the peak season of presentation (43.2%, 19/44). The median interval between arrival in the UK and laboratory testing was 7 days (IQR 4-13). Arriving from abroad </= 7 days before molecular testing (age-adjusted odds ratios [OR] 16.98, 95% CI 2.43-118.75, P  =   0.004) and travel to South or Southeast Asia regions (age-adjusted OR 4.41, 95% CI 1.07-18.21, P  =   0.040) were associated with detectable viraemia at presentation. Only one DF patient met the WHO severity criteria. HIV serostatus was determined in 61.4% (27/44) of cases. CONCLUSION: Clinicians need to improve DF recognition as well as rates of HIV testing in tropical travellers. Region of travel and time since arrival from DF endemic settings may help clinicians optimize requests for molecular testing. Further research on the clinical and public health aspects of imported DF is needed.","['Riddell, Anna', 'Babiker, Zahir Osman Eltahir']","['Riddell A', 'Babiker ZO']",,"['Department of Infection, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, Newark Street, London, UK.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, UAE.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,England,J Travel Med,Journal of travel medicine,9434456,,IM,"['Adult', 'Communicable Disease Control', 'Dengue/blood/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans', 'London/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Travel']",,2017/03/30 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2017/03/30 06:00'],"['2017/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['3062597 [pii]', '10.1093/jtm/tax015 [doi]']",ppublish,J Travel Med. 2017 May 1;24(3). doi: 10.1093/jtm/tax015.,3,"['(c) International Society of Travel Medicine, 2017.

The four dengue serotypes, DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4 are nearly human-specific. Clinical symptoms of dengue vary from unapparent infection, mild febrile manifestations to hemorrhagic forms with or without shock syndrome. Dengue viruses are transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, the most important vectors being Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The epidemiology of the disease can be divided into endemo-epidemic situations occurring in South-East Asia, and epidemic situations found in Pacific islands, Africa and Tropical America. Maintenance of dengue is supported by an increasing demography, uncontrolled urbanization and climatic conditions favorable to the vectors. Spread of dengue is primarily caused by modern transportation means, especially the aircraft. The geographical distribution of dengue is pantropical, except for Madagascar and some african regions. Because no vaccine and no specific treatment actually exist against dengue viruses, mosquito control is the only way to reduce the incidence of dengue around the world.

During epidemics in Cuba and Haiti, ethnic African descendant population had lower risk of dengue, and the ethnic factor was proposed as a protective one. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relation between the Dengue's cumulative incidence and the Afro-Colombian proportion in communities of Cali, during the epidemic of 2013. METHODS: This study was conducted in Cali, Colombia. The design was ecological, using information from the National Census 2005 projected to 2013, from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), and the National Epidemiological Surveillance System. It was obtained the Pearson s correlation coefficient between cumulative incidence and the proportion of Afro-Colombian population by communities. Additionally, the cumulative incidences of dengue were evaluated in two zones with different proportion of Afro-Colombian population. The association was also evaluated for aggregation bias, confounding by social variables, and interaction by area of ​​residence. RESULTS: Dengue s cumulative incidence was significantly lower for Afro-Colombians regardless of the proportion of Afro-Colombian population in the area of residence. The relative risk of dengue between non-Afro-Colombians and Afro-Colombians was 9.4 (95% CI=8.4-10.6) in zones with high proportion of Afro-Colombian population, while the relative risk of dengue was 4.0 (95% CI :3.6 - 4.4) in the zone with lower proportion of Afro-Colombian population. There was no evidence of aggregation bias or confounding in the association by social variables. CONCLUSIONS: The Afro-Colombian population had a significantly lower risk of getting dengue and its complications, compared with the non-Afro-Colombian population. The non-Afro-Colombian populations living in areas with a high proportion of Afro-Colombians increase their risk of dengue more than double, suggesting an asymptomatic viremic environment. INTRODUCCION: el dengue es un problema prioritario en salud publica. Durante epidemias en Cuba y Haiti, la poblacion etnica afro-descendiente tuvo menor riesgo de dengue. Por ello, se propuso el factor etnico como protector. OBJETIVO: Determinar la relacion entre la incidencia acumulada de dengue y la proporcion de poblacion Afrocolombiana de Cali, durante la epidemia de 2013. METODOS: Este estudio se realizo en Cali, Colombia. El diseno fue ecologico, con informacion del Censo Nacional 2005 y su proyeccion a 2013 del DANE y del Sistema de entre las incidencias acumuladas de dengue y la proporcion de afrocolombianos, segun comunidades. Adicionalmente, fueron evaluadas las incidencias acumuladas de dos zonas con diferente proporcion de habitantes afrocolombianos. Tambien se evaluo la presencia del sesgo de agregacion, de confusion por variables sociales y de interaccion segun la zona de residencia. RESULTADOS: Para afrocolombianos, la incidencia acumulada de dengue fue significativamente menor, independientemente de la proporcion de poblacion afrocolombiana en la zona de residencia. El riesgo relativo de dengue entre no-afrocolombianos y afrocolombianos fue 9.4 (IC 95%= 8.4-10.6) en la zona con mas alta proporcion de poblacion afrocolombiana, mientras que el riesgo relativo fue 4.0 (IC 95%= 3.6-4.4) en la zona de mas baja proporcion de poblacion afrocolombiana. No se evidencio sesgo de agregacion ni confusion de la asociacion por variables sociales. CONCLUSIONES: La poblacion afrocolombiana presento un riesgo significativamente menor de enfermar por dengue y sus complicaciones en comparacion con no-afrocolombianos. La poblacion no-afrocolombiana que reside en zonas con alta proporcion de poblacion afrocolombiana aumenta el riesgo de dengue a mas del doble, lo cual sugiere un entorno viremico asintomatico.","['Rojas Palacios, Jorge Humberto', 'Alzate, Alberto', 'Martinez Romero, Hector Jairo', 'Concha-Eastman, Alberto Ignacio']","['Rojas Palacios JH', 'Alzate A', 'Martinez Romero HJ', 'Concha-Eastman AI']",,"['Grupo de Epidemiologia y Salud Publica, Secretaria de Salud Publica Municipal de Cali, Alcaldia Municipal de Santiago de Cali, Cali Colombia; Grupo de Investigacion en modelos y metodos matematicos para el control y vigilancia del dengue, Cali, Colombia.', 'Grupo de Investigacion en Epidemiologia y Servicios (GRIEPIS).

Accurate estimates of the burden of dengue, its spatial distribution and the potential impact of Wolbachia are critical in guiding funder and government decisions on its future wider use. METHODS: Here, we combine multiple modelling methods for burden estimation to predict national case burden disaggregated by severity and map the distribution of burden across the country using three separate data sources. An ensemble of transmission models then predicts the estimated reduction in dengue transmission following a nationwide roll-out of wMel Wolbachia. RESULTS: We estimate that 7.8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1.8-17.7 million) symptomatic dengue cases occurred in Indonesia in 2015 and were associated with 332,865 (UI 94,175-754,203) lost disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The majority of dengue's burden was due to non-severe cases that did not seek treatment or were challenging to diagnose in outpatient settings leading to substantial underreporting. Estimated burden was highly concentrated in a small number of large cities with 90% of dengue cases occurring in 15.3% of land area. Implementing a nationwide Wolbachia population replacement programme was estimated to avert 86.2% (UI 36.2-99.9%) of cases over a long-term average. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest interventions targeted to the highest burden cities can have a disproportionate impact on dengue burden. Area-wide interventions, such as Wolbachia, that are deployed based on the area covered could protect people more efficiently than individual-based interventions, such as vaccines, in such dense environments.","[""O'Reilly, Kathleen M"", 'Hendrickx, Emilie', 'Kharisma, Dinar D', 'Wilastonegoro, Nandyan N', 'Carrington, Lauren B', 'Elyazar, Iqbal R F', 'Kucharski, Adam J', 'Lowe, Rachel', 'Flasche, Stefan', 'Pigott, David M', 'Reiner, Robert C Jr', 'Edmunds, W John', 'Hay, Simon I', 'Yakob, Laith', 'Shepard, Donald S', 'Brady, Oliver J']","[""O'Reilly KM"", 'Hendrickx E', 'Kharisma DD', 'Wilastonegoro NN', 'Carrington LB', 'Elyazar IRF', 'Kucharski AJ', 'Lowe R', 'Flasche S', 'Pigott DM', 'Reiner RC Jr', 'Edmunds WJ', 'Hay SI', 'Yakob L', 'Shepard DS', 'Brady OJ']",,"['Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Infectious Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Public Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Heller School for Social Policy and Management, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Public Health and Nursing, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.', 'Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Wellcome Trust Asia-Africa Programme, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Eijkman Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology, Jakarta, Indonesia.', 'Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Public Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Public Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Public Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Department of Health Metrics Sciences, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Health Metrics Sciences, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Public Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Department of Health Metrics Sciences, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Infectious Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Heller School for Social Policy and Management, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA.', 'Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK. oliver.brady@lshtm.ac.uk.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Public Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK. oliver.brady@lshtm.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190909,England,BMC Med,BMC medicine,101190723,,IM,"['Aedes/*microbiology', 'Animals', 'Cost of Illness', 'Dengue/epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission', 'Dengue Virus', 'Humans', 'Indonesia/epidemiology', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Pest Control, Biological/*methods', '*Wolbachia']",PMC6732838,2019/09/10 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/09/10 06:00'],"['2019/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12916-019-1396-4 [pii]', '1396 [pii]', '10.1186/s12916-019-1396-4 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med. 2019 Sep 9;17(1):172. doi: 10.1186/s12916-019-1396-4.,1,,['NOTNLM'],"['Burden', 'Dengue', 'Elimination', 'Indonesia', 'Maps', 'Model', 'Wolbachia']",['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,"['206471/Z/17/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '206250/Z/17/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '208812/Z/17/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main pathogenesis involves a dramatic increase in chest pressure, owing to severe plasma leakage and mechanical respiratory support, hampering the heart's ability to pump effectively and impeding adequate blood venous return to the heart chambers. To date, there is a paucity of clinical data about Dengue obstructive shock syndrome reported. PATIENT CONCERNS: The 2 reported patients presented with prolonged and decompensated dengue shock with critical multi-organ failures and mechanical ventilation. The patients' hemodynamics were profoundly affected by high pressure in the thoracic and abdominal cavities resulting from Dengue-induced severe plasma leakage and mechanical ventilation. DIAGNOSES: Clinical presentations, laboratory data, mini-fluid challenge test, and point-of-care (POCUS) were used to make diagnoses and guide management. INTERVENTIONS: Clinical monitoring, judicious fluid (colloids and blood products) administration guided by repeated POCUS to properly assess the adequacy of the intravascular volume, homeostasis adjustments by plasma exchange, and continuous renal replacement therapies. OUTCOMES: The patients had favorable outcomes. LESSONS: Our study highlights the clinical manifestations and management of children with dengue obstructive shock syndrome and underscores the importance of monitoring hemodynamics by consecutive POCUS at the bedside in order to make a timely diagnosis and assess intravascular fluid volume inadequacy accurately as well as closely monitor the fluid management responses.","['Nguyen, Thanh Tat', 'Le, Nhung Thi-Hong', 'Nguyen, Ngoc Minh', 'Do, Viet Chau', 'Trinh, Tung Huu', 'Vo, Luan Thanh']","['Nguyen TT', 'Le NT', 'Nguyen NM', 'Do VC', 'Trinh TH', 'Vo LT']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3188-5967'],"[""Department of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital No.2, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam."", 'Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Pediatric Department, Binh Duong General Hospital, Binh Duong, Vietnam.', ""Department of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital No.2, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital No.2, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital No.2, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital No.2, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', '*Respiration, Artificial', 'Hemodynamics', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Plasma', '*Dengue/complications/diagnosis/therapy']",PMC9622697,2022/11/02 06:00,2022/11/03 06:00,['2022/11/01 01:04'],"['2022/11/01 01:04 [entrez]', '2022/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['00005792-202210280-00078 [pii]', '10.1097/MD.0000000000031322 [doi]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2022 Oct 28;101(43):e31322. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000031322.,43,"['Copyright (c) 2022 the Author(s).

However, few studies have identified the complex interactive relationship between potential risk factors and severe dengue. This research aimed to assess the potential risk factors and detect their high-order combinative effects on severe dengue. A structured questionnaire was used to collect detailed dengue outbreak data from eight representative hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2019. Logistic regression and machine learning models were used to examine the complex effects of demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and biochemical markers on severe dengue. A total of 1,090 dengue cases (158 severe and 932 non-severe) were included in this study. Dyspnoea (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2.87, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.72 to 4.77), plasma leakage (OR = 3.61, 95% CI: 2.12 to 6.15), and hemorrhage (OR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.46 to 3.73) were positively and significantly associated with the occurrence of severe dengue. Classification and regression tree models showed that the probability of occurrence of severe dengue cases ranged from 7% (age >12.5 years without plasma leakage) to 92.9% (age </=12.5 years with dyspnoea and plasma leakage). The random forest model indicated that age was the most important factor in predicting severe dengue, followed by education, plasma leakage, platelet, and dyspnoea. The research provides new evidence to identify key risk factors contributing to severe dengue cases, which could be beneficial to clinical doctors to identify and predict the severity of dengue early.","['Yang, Jingli', 'Mosabbir, Abdullah Al', 'Raheem, Enayetur', 'Hu, Wenbiao', 'Hossain, Mohammad Sorowar']","['Yang J', 'Mosabbir AA', 'Raheem E', 'Hu W', 'Hossain MS']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6422-9240', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7143-2909']","['Ecosystem Change and Population Health Research Group, School of Public Health and Social Work, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia.', 'College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Emerging and Neglected Diseases, Biomedical Research Foundation, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'Department of Emerging and Neglected Diseases, Biomedical Research Foundation, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'Ecosystem Change and Population Health Research Group, School of Public Health and Social Work, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Department of Emerging and Neglected Diseases, Biomedical Research Foundation, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'School of Environment and Life Sciences, Independent University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20230315,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Child', '*Severe Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology/complications', 'Bangladesh/epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Hospitals', 'Biomarkers', 'Demography', '*Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology']",PMC10042364,2023/03/16 06:00,2023/03/29 06:05,['2023/03/15 13:53'],"['2022/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2023/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2023/03/29 06:05 [medline]', '2023/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/03/15 13:53 [entrez]']","['PNTD-D-22-01070 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0011161 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2023 Mar 15;17(3):e0011161. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0011161. eCollection 2023 Mar.,3,"['Copyright: (c) 2023 Yang et al.

There is a need to investigate these factors on a fine scale for dengue fever. METHODS: In this study, a dataset of dengue fever cases and environmental and socio-economic factors was constructed at 1-km spatial resolution, in particular 'land types' (LT), obtained from the first high resolution remote sensing satellite launched from China (GF-1 satellite), and 'land surface temperature', obtained from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Spatial analysis methods, including point density, average nearest neighbor, spatial autocorrelation, and hot spot analysis, were used to analyze spatial patterns of dengue fever. Spearman rank correlation and ordinary least squares (OLS) were used to explore associated environmental and socio-economic risk factors of dengue fever in five districts of Guangzhou City, China in 2014. RESULTS: A total of 30553 dengue fever cases were reported in the districts of Baiyun, Haizhu, Yuexiu, Liwan, and Tianhe of Guangzhou, China in 2014. Dengue fever cases showed strong seasonal variation. The cases from August to October accounted for 96.3% of the total cases in 2014. The top three districts for dengue fever morbidity were Baiyun (1.32%), Liwan (0.62%), and Haizhu (0.60%). Strong spatial clusters of dengue fever cases were observed. Areas of high density for dengue fever were located at the district junctions. The dengue fever outbreak was significantly correlated with LT, normalized difference water index (NDWI), land surface temperature of daytime (LSTD), land surface temperature of nighttime (LSTN), population density (PD), and gross domestic product (GDP) (correlation coefficients of 0.483, 0.456, 0.612, 0.699, 0.705, and 0.205, respectively). The OLS equation was built with dengue fever cases as the dependent variable and LT, LSTN, and PD as explanatory variables. The residuals were not spatially autocorrelated. The adjusted R-squared was 0.320. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of spatio-temporal patterns and risk factors of dengue fever can provide scientific information for public health practitioners to formulate targeted, strategic plans and implement effective public health prevention and control measures.","['Yue, Yujuan', 'Sun, Jimin', 'Liu, Xiaobo', 'Ren, Dongsheng', 'Liu, Qiyong', 'Xiao, Xiangming', 'Lu, Liang']","['Yue Y', 'Sun J', 'Liu X', 'Ren D', 'Liu Q', 'Xiao X', 'Lu L']",,"[""State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102206, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102206, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102206, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102206, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102206, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Microbiology and Plant Biology, University of Oklahoma, OK, USA.', ""State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102206, People's Republic of China.

During the 1940's, several dengue-like outbreaks were reported from French Guiana. Then, the only dengue vector, Aedes aegypti, was eradicated between 1950 and 1963, when it started to reinfest the country. By the end of the 1960's, new dengue epidemics with serological confirmation were described. After 1970, the first dengue strains were isolated, firstly dengue-2 strains, then dengue-1 and dengue-4 strains. Between 1970 and 1990, several dengue outbreaks struck French Guiana with 2 to 6 years intervals. In July 1991, started the first DHF outbreak in French Guiana which spread in all the most important towns until October 1992. About 3,000 cases were reported, that is almost 3% of the population, from which about 1/3 had serological confirmation; more than 300 people were hospitalized and some 80 with hemorrhages. Finally 6 deaths were reported, 5 of which had hemorrhages but could not be included into DHF cases according to WHO criteria. The dengue-2 strain responsible for this outbreak is close to the Jamaican topotype known to be particularly virulent. Since the beginning of 1993 and actually, dengue is still circulating in French Guiana, but at low level and dengue-1 and dengue-4 strains are occasionally isolated.","['Reynes, J M']",['Reynes JM'],,"[""Laboratoire d'entomologie medicale, Institut Pasteur de Guyane, Cayenne, Guyane francaise.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,France,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique (1990),9212564,,IM,"['Dengue/*epidemiology/*history/virology', 'Dengue Virus/classification/isolation & purification', 'French Guiana/epidemiology', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans']",,1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 1996;89(2):98-100; discussion 101.,2,,,,,,,,,La dengue en Guyane Francaise.

A global risk map for dengue is presented, based on a global database of the occurrence of this disease, derived from electronic literature searches. Remotely sensed satellite data (from NASA's MODIS series), interpolated meteorological data, predicted distribution maps of dengue's two main vector species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, a digital elevation surface and human population density data were all used as potential predictor variables in a non-linear discriminant analysis modelling framework. One hundred bootstrap models were produced by randomly sub-sampling three different training sets for dengue fever, severe dengue (i.e. dengue haemorrhagic fever, DHF) and all-dengue, and output predictions were averaged to produce a single global risk map for each type of dengue. This paper concentrates on the all-dengue models. Key predictor variables were various thermal data layers, including both day- and night-time Land Surface Temperature, human population density, and a variety of rainfall variables. The relative importance of each may be shown visually using rainbow files and quantitatively using a ranking system. Vegetation Index variables (a common proxy for humidity or saturation deficit) were rarely chosen in the models. The kappa index of agreement indicated an excellent (dengue haemorrhagic fever, Cohen's kappa=0.79 +/- 0.028, AUC=0.96 +/- 0.007) or good fit of the top ten models in each series to the data (Cohen's kappa=0.73 +/- 0.018, AUC=0.94 +/- 0.007 for dengue fever and 0.74 +/- 0.017, AUC=0.95 +/- 0.005 for all dengue). The global risk map predicts widespread dengue risk in SE Asia and India, in Central America and parts of coastal South America, but in relatively few regions of Africa. In many cases these are less extensive predictions than those of other published dengue risk maps and arise because of the key importance of high human population density for the all-dengue risk maps produced here. Three published dengue risk maps are compared using the Fleiss kappa index, and are shown to have only fair agreement globally (Fleiss kappa=0.377). Regionally the maps show greater (but still only moderate) agreement in SE Asia (Fleiss kappa=0.566), fair agreement in the Americas (Fleiss kappa=0.325) and only slight agreement in Africa (Fleiss kappa=0.095). The global dengue risk maps show that very few areas of rural Europe are presently suitable for dengue, but several major cities appear to be at some degree of risk, probably due to a combination of thermal conditions and high human population density, the top two variables in many models. Mahalanobis distance images were produced of Europe and the southern United States showing the distance in environmental rather than geographical space of each site from any site where dengue currently occurs. Parts of Europe are quite similar in Mahalanobis distance terms to parts of the southern United States, where dengue occurred in the recent past and which remain environmentally suitable for it. High standards of living rather than a changed environmental suitability keep dengue out of the USA. The threat of dengue to Europe at present is considered to be low but sufficiently uncertain to warrant monitoring in those areas of greatest predicted environmental suitability, especially in northern Italy and parts of Austria, Slovenia and Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro, Albania, Greece, south-eastern France, Germany and Switzerland, and in smaller regions elsewhere.","['Rogers, David J', 'Suk, Jonathan E', 'Semenza, Jan C']","['Rogers DJ', 'Suk JE', 'Semenza JC']",,"['University of Oxford, Department of Zoology, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PS, United Kingdom.

The four dengue types can replicate in vertebrate hosts beside humans and in other mosquito species than Ae. aegypti. The incidence of dengue on a population is largely variable according to the immunity status, the vector competence and the virus strains. Concomitant infections by two types of dengue virus or by an another pathogen (Alphavirus) have been observed. The environmental factors influencing the dengue ecosystem are mostly climatic (temperature, rainfall, wind) but also anthropic (transportation means, public buildings). Prevention of dengue epidemics must be based on public health education in schools, community participation, epidemiological surveillance linked with good vector control teams.

The mother was primigravida with an uneventful antenatal period except the fever she developed at 37 weeks of gestation. She underwent cesarean section for decreased fetal movement. The fever lasted for 7 days and was associated with intense bodyache, and a positive tourniquet test. She did not experience any hemorrhages including from the surgical wound. Her platelet count fell at its lowest to 100,000/mm3. She had bilateral mild pleural effusions and positive anti-dengue antibodies (both IgG and IgM). She received symptomatic treatment. The baby was deeply meconium stained and was resuscitated by a pediatrician. His postnatal period went well until day-3 of life when he developed fever and respiratory distress. There were no signs of meconiun aspiration syndrome (MAS) and the septic work up was negative. The platelets count fell to its lowest of 40,000/mm3 on day-3 and day-5 of his illness. Anti-dengue antibodies (both IgG and IgM) were positive with a nearly four-fold rise of IgM antibodies in the convalescent sera. The boy was treated with platelet transfusions and was discharged on day-6 after becoming ill. This report emphasizes that in a dengue epidemic or when dengue is endemic (which Bangladesh has experienced recently), a pregnant woman with fever, myalgia and/or bleeding manifestations should raise a high suspicion that the baby may develop the disease, and both the mother and baby should be closely followed-up.

Although the relationship between meteorological conditions and dengue incidence is well established, less is known about the modifying nature of sociodemographic variables on that relationship. We assess the strength and direction of sociodemographic effect modification of the temperature-dengue relationship in the second largest city of the Peruvian Amazon to identify populations that may have heightened vulnerability to dengue under varying climate conditions. We used weekly dengue counts and averaged meteorological variables to evaluate the association between disease incidence, meteorological exposures, and sociodemographic effect modifiers (gender, age, and district) in negative binomial regression models. District was included to consider geographical effect modification. We found that being a young child or elderly, being female, and living in the district of Manantay increased dengue's incidence rate ratio (IRR) as a result of 1 degrees C increase in weekly mean temperature (IRR = 2.99, 95% CI: 1.99-4.50 for women less than 5 years old and IRR = 2.86, 95% CI: = 1.93-4.22 for women older than 65 years, both estimates valid for the rainy season). The effect of temperature on dengue depended on season, with stronger effects during rainy seasons. Sociodemographic variables can provide options for intervention to mitigate health impacts with a changing climate. Our results indicate that patterns of baseline risk between regions and sociodemographic conditions can differ substantially from trends in climate sensitivity. These results challenge the assumption that the distribution of climate change impacts will be patterned similarly to existing social gradients in health.","['Charette, Margot', 'Berrang-Ford, Lea', 'Coomes, Oliver', 'Llanos-Cuentas, Elmer Alejandro', 'Carcamo, Cesar', 'Kulkarni, Manisha', 'Harper, Sherilee L']","['Charette M', 'Berrang-Ford L', 'Coomes O', 'Llanos-Cuentas EA', 'Carcamo C', 'Kulkarni M', 'Harper SL']",,"['Department of Geography, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', 'Priestley International Centre for Climate, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Geography, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', 'School of Public Health and Administration, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru.', 'School of Public Health and Administration, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru.', 'School of Epidemiology, Public Health and Preventive Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.', 'School of Public Health, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Trop Med Hyg,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,0370507,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Climate Change', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peru/epidemiology', 'Seasons', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC6947766,2019/11/09 06:00,2020/04/22 06:00,['2019/11/09 06:00'],"['2019/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['tpmd190033 [pii]', '10.4269/ajtmh.19-0033 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2020 Jan;102(1):180-190. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.19-0033.,1,,,,,,['CAPMC/CIHR/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Synthetic indicators were calculated to characterise timing (year of first dengue outbreak), permanence (number of years with dengue outbreaks) and intensity (outbreak occurrence). The indicators were used to map dengue diffusion and compare cities within different climatic zones, with varying population densities. RESULTS: Currently, a large portion of the country comprises a dengue transmission area, but cities situated in the mesothermal zone, in the south, and remote areas, in the north, are relatively exempt. Diffusion waves are spread from metropolitan areas towards medium and small cities generating outbreaks in their influence region. However, long-term permanence of transmission depends on the existence of a favourable climate, abundant population and connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Large and warm cities sustain and spread dengue viruses, for which specific dengue control measures must be developed. The concentration of outbreaks along climate transition fringes indicates a boundary between two transmission regimes and raises awareness to the effects of ongoing climatic and socio-economic changes.","['Barcellos, Christovam', 'Lowe, Rachel']","['Barcellos C', 'Lowe R']",,"['Instituto de Comunicacao e Informacao Cientifica e Tecnologica, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131129,England,Trop Med Int Health,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,9610576,,IM,"['Brazil/epidemiology', '*Cities', '*Climate', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/transmission/virology', '*Dengue Virus', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Humans']",,2013/11/30 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/11/30 06:00'],"['2013/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tmi.12227 [doi]'],ppublish,Trop Med Int Health. 2014 Feb;19(2):159-68. doi: 10.1111/tmi.12227.

We investigated the association of 10 biomarkers (VCAM-1, SDC-1, Ang-2, IL-8, IP-10, IL-1RA, sCD163, sTREM-1, ferritin, CRP) with the development of severe/moderate dengue (S/MD). METHODS: We performed a nested case-control study from a multi-country study. A total of 281 S/MD and 556 uncomplicated dengue cases were included. RESULTS: On days 1-3 from symptom onset, higher levels of any biomarker increased the risk of developing S/MD. When assessing together, SDC-1 and IL-1RA were stable, while IP-10 changed the association from positive to negative; others showed weaker associations. The best combinations associated with S/MD comprised IL-1RA, Ang-2, IL-8, ferritin, IP-10, and SDC-1 for children, and SDC-1, IL-8, ferritin, sTREM-1, IL-1RA, IP-10, and sCD163 for adults. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings assist the development of biomarker panels for clinical use and could improve triage and risk prediction in dengue patients. FUNDING: This study was supported by the EU's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7-281803 IDAMS), the WHO, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.","['Vuong, Nguyen Lam', 'Lam, Phung Khanh', 'Ming, Damien Keng Yen', 'Duyen, Huynh Thi Le', 'Nguyen, Nguyet Minh', 'Tam, Dong Thi Hoai', 'Duong Thi Hue, Kien', 'Chau, Nguyen Vv', 'Chanpheaktra, Ngoun', 'Lum, Lucy Chai See', 'Pleites, Ernesto', 'Simmons, Cameron P', 'Rosenberger, Kerstin D', 'Jaenisch, Thomas', 'Bell, David', 'Acestor, Nathalie', 'Halleux, Christine', 'Olliaro, Piero L', 'Wills, Bridget A', 'Geskus, Ronald B', 'Yacoub, Sophie']","['Vuong NL', 'Lam PK', 'Ming DKY', 'Duyen HTL', 'Nguyen NM', 'Tam DTH', 'Duong Thi Hue K', 'Chau NV', 'Chanpheaktra N', 'Lum LCS', 'Pleites E', 'Simmons CP', 'Rosenberger KD', 'Jaenisch T', 'Bell D', 'Acestor N', 'Halleux C', 'Olliaro PL', 'Wills BA', 'Geskus RB', 'Yacoub S']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2684-3041', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7968-473X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3125-6378', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5960-7849', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7452-4208', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9039-7392', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7010-6340', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9086-8804', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2740-3155']","['Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU), Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.', 'University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.', 'Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU), Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.', 'University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU), Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.', 'Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU), Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.', 'Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU), Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.', 'Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU), Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.', 'Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh city, Viet Nam.', 'Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap, Cambodia.', 'University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Hospital Nacional de Ninos Benjamin Bloom, San Salvador, El Salvador.', 'Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global health, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Institute for Vector-Borne Disease, Monash University, Clayton, Australia.', 'Section Clinical Tropical Medicine, Department for Infectious Diseases, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Section Clinical Tropical Medicine, Department for Infectious Diseases, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Institute of Global Health (HIGH), Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Independent consultant, Issaquah, United States.', 'Consultant, Intellectual Ventures, Global Good Fund, Bellevue, United States.', 'UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global health, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU), Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.', 'Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global health, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU), Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.', 'Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global health, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU), Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.', 'Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global health, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210622,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/blood/metabolism', 'Dengue/*blood/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Young Adult']",PMC8331184,2021/06/23 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2021/06/22 05:42'],"['2021/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/06/22 05:42 [entrez]']","['67460 [pii]', '10.7554/eLife.67460 [doi]']",epublish,Elife. 2021 Jun 22;10:e67460. doi: 10.7554/eLife.67460.,,"['(c) 2021, Vuong et al.']",['NOTNLM'],"['biomarkers', 'dengue', 'infectious disease', 'medicine', 'microbiology', 'prognostic', 'virus']","['NV, PL, HD, NN, DT, KD, NC, NC, EP, CS, KR, DB, NA, CH, PO No competing interests', 'declared, DM reports receiving personal fees from the Wellcome Trust (grant', 'number 215010/Z/18/Z), during the conduct of the study.

No single method can effectively identify patients at risk for disease progression and bad outcome. We aimed to determine the relationship between liver dysfunction, kinetics of liver function tests (LFTs) and severity of hepatitis on the outcome in pediatric dengue illness. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of hospitalized children (1-12 years) with dengue infection (July 2014-July 2015). Serial monitoring of LFTs was done in confirmed dengue cases. Patients were classified into non-severe (NSD) and severe dengue (SD). Severity of hepatitis was graded: mild, moderate and severe hepatitis. Events were noted during hospitalization. RESULTS: One hundred two children (66, boys), median age 72 (48-96) months, were analyzed (NSD, n = 41; SD, n = 61). Elevated transaminases (92%) was the most common abnormality; aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) in 87% and 82%, respectively. Maximum abnormalities in LFTs peaked at day 5 (AST, ALT) and day 7 (Alkaline Phosphatase [ALP], gamma-glutamyl transferase) of illness. Elevated transaminases was found to be higher in SD than NSD (100% vs. 80%, P = 0.006). Severe hepatitis developed organ dysfunction such as altered sensorium (P < 0.001), ALF (P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (P < 0.001) and shock (P < 0.001), more commonly than those with mild to moderate hepatitis. Fourteen patients died, two-thirds of whom had severe hepatitis (P < 0.001). Using binary logistic regression, presence of severe hepatitis and shock at presentation was an independent predictor for ALF (odds ratio: 77; 95% confidence interval : 13-457, P < 0.001) and mortality (odds ratio: 55; 95% confidence interval: 4.6-66, P < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Many children with dengue have liver involvement. Severe hepatitis in dengue is associated with significant organ dysfunction and poor outcome.","['Prasad, Durga', 'Bhriguvanshi, Arpita']","['Prasad D', 'Bhriguvanshi A']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics King George's Medical University Lucknow 226003, Uttar Pradesh, India.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/*complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/*virology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Liver Diseases/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Prospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Symptom Assessment']",,2019/12/10 06:00,2020/10/31 06:00,['2019/12/10 06:00'],"['2019/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['00006454-202002000-00002 [pii]', '10.1097/INF.0000000000002519 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2020 Feb;39(2):97-101. doi: 10.1097/INF.0000000000002519.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This mosquito was identified for the first time in French Guiana in 1902. More recently, in 1940, an eradication campaign started and Aedes aegypti was eradicated between 1950 and 1963, date of the reinfestation. During the past 30 years, some dengue outbreaks occurred every 2 to 6 years, and the first dengue haemorrhagic fever epidemic spread over the country in 1992. Actually, Ae. aegypti is distributed almost all inhabited areas of French Guiana: in the towns, villages, smaller human settlements, and was also found in a wild area. The most frequent Ae. aegypti breeding-sources are the outside discarded small containers, other less frequent breeding-sites are the outside flower pots and the outside big containers. The type of breeding-source significantly influences the duration of larval and pupal development. In French Guiana, Ae. aegypti is the only vector of dengue. The vertical transmission of dengue viruses under field conditions was demonstrated. Dengue is thus endemic in the country and has almost the same distribution as Ae. aegypti, with most probably the same possibilities of extension. Ae. aegypti can be considered not only as vector and an amplificator of dengue in French Guiana, but also as a reservoir, even if occasional.","['Fouque, F', 'Carinci, R']","['Fouque F', 'Carinci R']",,"[""Laboratoire d'eptomologie medicale, Institut Pasteur de Guyane francaise, Cayenne, Guyane francaise.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,France,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique (1990),9212564,,IM,"['Aedes/*growth & development', 'Animals', 'Dengue/epidemiology/*history/*transmission/virology', 'Ecology', 'French Guiana/epidemiology', 'History, 18th Century', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', '*Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical']",,1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 1996;89(2):115-9.,2,,,,,,,7,,"Aedes Aegypti en Guyane Franaise.

Studies on dengue in rural areas are scarce since the disease is considered mainly urban. OBJECTIVE: To determine the knowledge (K), attitudes (A) and practices (P) of dengue in an endemic area in Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 515 pupils (7-16 years old) in 34 rural schools in Anapoima and La Mesa municipalities during 2011. Each KAP category was evaluated independently by a scoring system and then categorized into high, medium or low. RESULTS: Pupils recognized knowledge variables such as the symptoms (fever, bone pain), transmission route (mosquito bites), and mosquito breeding sites (uncovered water tanks, solid waste). Average scores on attitude were high in both municipalities indicating a well-developed perception of disease severity. Seeking treatment in medical centers and self-medication for fever management and the use of mosquito net and space-spraying of insecticides were the most frequently identified practices. DISCUSSION: This is the first KAP dengue study performed in a rural area in Colombia and as such it contributes to the understanding of dengue perceptions by the inhabitants of these areas. It showed a medium level of knowledge about dengue and a lower level of preventive practices in pupils from rural schools. It also showed that pupils considered space-spraying as crucial for vector control. The presence of the vector in rural areas of the country underlines the need to improve surveillance and education to more effectively control the vector and promote prevention methods including community participation.","['Sarmiento-Senior, Diana', 'Matiz, Maria Ines', 'Jaramillo-Gomez, Juan Felipe', 'Olano, Victor Alberto', 'Vargas, Sandra Lucia', 'Alexander, Neal', 'Lenhart, Audrey', 'Stenstrom, Thor Axel', 'Overgaard, Hans Jorgen']","['Sarmiento-Senior D', 'Matiz MI', 'Jaramillo-Gomez JF', 'Olano VA', 'Vargas SL', 'Alexander N', 'Lenhart A', 'Stenstrom TA', 'Overgaard HJ']",,"['Instituto de Salud y Ambiente, Universidad El Bosque, Bogota, D.C., Colombia. sarmientodiana@unbosque.edu.co.']","['eng', 'spa']",['Journal Article'],20190901,Colombia,Biomedica,Biomedica : revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud,8205605,['0 (Insecticides)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Breeding', 'Child', 'Colombia', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Dengue/complications/diagnosis/therapy/transmission', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Insect Bites and Stings/virology', 'Insecticides', 'Male', 'Mosquito Nets', '*Rural Population', 'Schools', 'Symptom Assessment']",PMC7357362,2019/10/05 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2019/10/05 06:00'],"['2017/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7705/biomedica.4255 [doi]'],epublish,Biomedica. 2019 Sep 1;39(3):478-490. doi: 10.7705/biomedica.4255.,3,,['NOTNLM'],"['Dengue/prevention & control', 'health knowledge attitudes practice', 'rural health', 'ethnology', 'Colombia']","['Conflicts of interest: The authors have declared that no competing interests', 'exist']",,['MR/R010161/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,"Conocimientos, actitudes y practicas sobre dengue en estudiantes de escuelas rurales de un area endemica en Colombia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whilst infection by one serotype appears to convey life-long protection to homologous infection, it is believed to be a risk factor for severe disease manifestations upon secondary, heterologous infection due to the phenomenon of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). Subsequent clinical infections are rarely reported and, since the majority of dengue infections are generally asymptomatic, it is not clear if and to what degree tertiary or quaternary infections contribute to dengue epidemiology. Here we investigate the effect of third and subsequent infections on the transmission dynamics of dengue and show that although the qualitative patterns are largely equivalent, the system more readily exhibits the desynchronised serotype oscillations and multi-annual epidemic outbreaks upon their inclusion. More importantly, permitting third and fourth infections significantly increases the force of infection without resorting to high basic reproductive numbers. Realistic age-prevalent patterns and seroconversion rates are therefore easier reconciled with a low value of dengue's transmission potential if allowing for more than two infections; this should have important consequences for dengue control and intervention measures.","['Wikramaratna, Paul S', 'Simmons, Cameron P', 'Gupta, Sunetra', 'Recker, Mario']","['Wikramaratna PS', 'Simmons CP', 'Gupta S', 'Recker M']",,"['Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100823,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Dengue Virus/*classification/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Models, Biological', 'Severe Dengue/*epidemiology/transmission/*virology', 'Time Factors']",PMC2925950,2010/09/03 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10-PONE-RA-19289R1 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0012347 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Aug 23;5(8):e12347. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0012347.,8,,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,"['084368/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because dengue outbreaks are expected to continue in south Texas and early case identification and timely treatment can reduce mortality, we sought to determine clinicians' knowledge of dengue and its clinical management. A survey was sent to 2,375 south Texas clinicians; 217 (9%) completed the survey. Approximately half of participants demonstrated knowledge needed to identify dengue cases, including symptoms (56%), early indicators of shock (54%), or timing of thrombocytopenia (48%). Fewer than 20% correctly identified all prevention messages, severe dengue warning signs, or circumstances in which a dengue patient should return for care. Knowledge of clinical management was limited; few participants correctly identified scenarios when plasma leakage occurred (10%) or a crystalloid solution was indicated (7%); however, 45% correctly identified when a blood transfusion was indicated. Because of the ongoing threat of dengue, we recommend clinicians in south Texas receive dengue clinical management training.","['Adam, Jessica K', 'Abeyta, Roman', 'Smith, Brian', 'Gaul, Linda', 'Thomas, Dana L', 'Han, George', 'Sharp, Tyler M', 'Waterman, Stephen H', 'Tomashek, Kay M']","['Adam JK', 'Abeyta R', 'Smith B', 'Gaul L', 'Thomas DL', 'Han G', 'Sharp TM', 'Waterman SH', 'Tomashek KM']",,"['Epidemic Intelligence Service, Division of Scientific Education and Professional Development, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Texas Department of State Health Services, Harlingen, Texas.', 'Texas Department of State Health Services, Harlingen, Texas.', 'Texas Department of State Health Services, Austin, Texas.', 'Epidemic Intelligence Service, Division of Scientific Education and Professional Development, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170406,United States,Am J Trop Med Hyg,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,0370507,,IM,"['Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Dengue Virus/isolation & purification', '*Disease Outbreaks', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Physicians', 'Professional Competence/*statistics & numerical data', 'Severe Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Texas/epidemiology']",PMC5361550,2017/02/01 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2017/02/01 06:00'],"['2017/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['ajtmh.16-0367 [pii]', '10.4269/ajtmh.16-0367 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2017 Mar;96(3):708-714. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.16-0367.

The relationship between the elevation of hepatic enzymes and severity of Dengue was assessed after stratifying recorded maximum AST/ALT (SGOT/SGPT) values 2-15 times elevated and by the phases of the illness. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and ROC curves were assessed using maximum values for AST and ALT. RESULTS: Out of 255 patients, 107(42%) were females. The majority (52.9%) were in the 20-39 year age group. Only 19.6% had DHF. No statistically significant difference was noticed in the values of maximum transaminases during the febrile phase among DF and DHF patients. Higher sensitivity and low specificity with the 1-5 times elevation range was noticed, and a higher cut-off level of more than 5 times elevation showed low sensitivity and higher specificity. The combination of both transaminases cut-offs with age and sex also does not show clinically significant predictability of severe disease. The AST and ALT elevations are not showing discriminatory predictive value on dengue severity. As different serotypes cause different epidemics, it is important to carry out large-scale specific studies considering the serotypes.","['Priyangika, Dickowita Kankanamge Dilani', 'Premawansa, Gayani', 'Adikari, Madura', 'Thillainathan, Sharmila', 'Premawansa, Sunil', 'Jayamanne, Bernard Deepal Wanniarachchi', 'Premaratna, Ranjan']","['Priyangika DKD', 'Premawansa G', 'Adikari M', 'Thillainathan S', 'Premawansa S', 'Jayamanne BDW', 'Premaratna R']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8040-1546'],"['University Medical Unit, Teaching Hospital, Ragama, Sri Lanka.', 'Colombo North Teaching Hospital, Ragama, Sri Lanka.', 'Colombo North Teaching Hospital, Ragama, Sri Lanka.', 'Colombo North Teaching Hospital, Ragama, Sri Lanka.', 'Zoology and Environmental Science, Faculty of Science, University of Colombo, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, Kelaniya, Sri Lanka. bdw.jayamanne@kln.ac.lk.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, Kelaniya, Sri Lanka.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210630,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,,IM,"['Adult', '*Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver Function Tests', '*Severe Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Sri Lanka/epidemiology', 'Tertiary Healthcare']",PMC8243863,2021/07/02 06:00,2021/07/03 06:00,['2021/07/01 05:51'],"['2021/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/01 05:51 [entrez]', '2021/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13104-021-05670-0 [pii]', '5670 [pii]', '10.1186/s13104-021-05670-0 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2021 Jun 30;14(1):251. doi: 10.1186/s13104-021-05670-0.,1,,['NOTNLM'],"['And liver enzymes', 'Dengue', 'Dengue severity prediction', 'Transaminases in Dengue']",['No financial and non-financial competing interests to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 575 patients with a diagnosis of dengue were admitted to the hospital in 2017, of which 15 died (mortality rate 2.6%). Four patients died in the emergency medical unit; 11 patients who died after admission to the inpatient unit had multi-organ dysfunction at the time of presentation, with shock, severe liver dysfunction, and severe metabolic acidosis. Only 4/11 patients had hemoconcentration, and 10/11 patients had high white cell counts. In five patients where serum ferritin was performed, it was more than 40,000 ng/mL. Death occurred at a median time of 2 days after hospitalization despite good supportive care. Although there is scope for improvement of supportive care in these patients, it appears that other interventions are urgently needed to improve outcomes in severe dengue.

New tools are needed to distinguish dengue from other febrile illnesses. In addition, the natural history of pediatric dengue early in illness in a community-based setting has not been well-defined. METHODS: Data from the multi-year, ongoing Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study of approximately 3,800 children aged 2-14 years in Managua, Nicaragua, were used to examine the frequency of clinical signs and symptoms by day of illness and to generate models for the association of signs and symptoms during the early phase of illness and over the entire course of illness with testing dengue-positive. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using generalized estimating equations (GEE) for repeated measures, adjusting for age and gender. RESULTS: One-fourth of children who tested dengue-positive did not meet the WHO case definition for suspected dengue. The frequency of signs and symptoms varied by day of illness, dengue status, and disease severity. Multivariable GEE models showed increased odds of testing dengue-positive associated with fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, petechiae, positive tourniquet test, vomiting, leukopenia, platelets </=150,000 cells/mL, poor capillary refill, cold extremities and hypotension. Estimated ORs tended to be higher for signs and symptoms over the course of illness compared to the early phase of illness. CONCLUSIONS: Day-by-day analysis of clinical signs and symptoms together with longitudinal statistical analysis showed significant associations with testing dengue-positive and important differences during the early phase of illness compared to the entire course of illness. These findings stress the importance of considering day of illness when developing prediction algorithms for real-time clinical management.","['Biswas, Hope H', 'Ortega, Oscar', 'Gordon, Aubree', 'Standish, Katherine', 'Balmaseda, Angel', 'Kuan, Guillermina', 'Harris, Eva']","['Biswas HH', 'Ortega O', 'Gordon A', 'Standish K', 'Balmaseda A', 'Kuan G', 'Harris E']",,"['Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120306,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Dengue Virus/*pathogenicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Nicaragua', 'Time Factors']",PMC3295819,2012/03/14 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2012/03/14 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['PNTD-D-11-01034 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0001562 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2012;6(3):e1562. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001562.

We calculated the sensitivity of the various classification systems for the detection of shock and the agreement between the various classification systems and the treating physician's classification. RESULTS: Of 152 patients with confirmed dengue, sixty-six (43%) had evidence of circulatory failure. The WHO classification system had a sensitivity of 86% (95%CI 76-94) for the detection of patients with shock. All modifications to the WHO classification system had a higher sensitivity than the WHO classification system (sensitivity ranging from 88% to 99%). The WHO classification system was in only modest agreement with the intuitive classification by treating physicians whereas several modified classification systems were in good agreement. CONCLUSION: The use of the WHO classification system to classify dengue disease severity is to be questioned, because it is not accurate in correctly classifying dengue disease severity and it lacks sufficient agreement with clinical practice.","['Setiati, Tatty E', 'Mairuhu, Albert T A', 'Koraka, Penelopie', 'Supriatna, Mohamed', 'Mac Gillavry, Melvin R', 'Brandjes, Dees P M', 'Osterhaus, Albert D M E', 'van der Meer, Jos W M', 'van Gorp, Eric C M', 'Soemantri, Augustinus']","['Setiati TE', 'Mairuhu AT', 'Koraka P', 'Supriatna M', 'Mac Gillavry MR', 'Brandjes DP', 'Osterhaus AD', 'van der Meer JW', 'van Gorp EC', 'Soemantri A']",,"['Department of Child Health, Dr. Kariadi Hospital, Semarang, Indonesia. tatty@smg.melsa.net.id <tatty@smg.melsa.net.id>']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070326,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/*classification/complications/diagnosis', 'Dengue Virus', 'Humans', 'Indonesia', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Shock/etiology', 'World Health Organization']",PMC1847434,2007/03/28 09:00,2007/04/27 09:00,['2007/03/28 09:00'],"['2006/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2334-7-22 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2334-7-22 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2007 Mar 26;7:22. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-7-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weather variables have a significant impact on the transmission of Dengue Fever (DF), a mosquito borne viral disease. DF in mainland China is characterized as an imported disease. Hence it is necessary to explore the roles of imported cases, mosquito density and climate variability in dengue transmission in China. The study was to identify the relationship between dengue occurrence and possible risk factors and to develop a predicting model for dengue's control and prevention purpose. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three traditional suburbs and one district with an international airport in Guangzhou city were selected as the study areas. Autocorrelation and cross-correlation analysis were used to perform univariate analysis to identify possible risk factors, with relevant lagged effects, associated with local dengue cases. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to extract principal components and PCA score was used to represent the original variables to reduce multi-collinearity. Combining the univariate analysis and prior knowledge, time-series Poisson regression analysis was conducted to quantify the relationship between weather variables, Breteau Index, imported DF cases and the local dengue transmission in Guangzhou, China. The goodness-of-fit of the constructed model was determined by pseudo-R2, Akaike information criterion (AIC) and residual test. There were a total of 707 notified local DF cases from March 2006 to December 2012, with a seasonal distribution from August to November. There were a total of 65 notified imported DF cases from 20 countries, with forty-six cases (70.8%) imported from Southeast Asia. The model showed that local DF cases were positively associated with mosquito density, imported cases, temperature, precipitation, vapour pressure and minimum relative humidity, whilst being negatively associated with air pressure, with different time lags. CONCLUSIONS: Imported DF cases and mosquito density play a critical role in local DF transmission, together with weather variables. The establishment of an early warning system, using existing surveillance datasets will help to control and prevent dengue in Guangzhou, China.","['Sang, Shaowei', 'Yin, Wenwu', 'Bi, Peng', 'Zhang, Honglong', 'Wang, Chenggang', 'Liu, Xiaobo', 'Chen, Bin', 'Yang, Weizhong', 'Liu, Qiyong']","['Sang S', 'Yin W', 'Bi P', 'Zhang H', 'Wang C', 'Liu X', 'Chen B', 'Yang W', 'Liu Q']",,"['State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Surveillance and Early-Warning on Infectious Disease, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China; WHO Collaborating Centre for Vector Surveillance and Management, Changping, Beijing, China; Shandong University Climate Change and Health Center, Jinan, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Surveillance and Early-Warning on Infectious Disease, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.', 'School of Population Health, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Key Laboratory of Surveillance and Early-Warning on Infectious Disease, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, China; Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, China; Shandong University Climate Change and Health Center, Jinan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Surveillance and Early-Warning on Infectious Disease, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China; WHO Collaborating Centre for Vector Surveillance and Management, Changping, Beijing, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, China; Xiamen Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau, Xiamen, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Surveillance and Early-Warning on Infectious Disease, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Surveillance and Early-Warning on Infectious Disease, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China; WHO Collaborating Centre for Vector Surveillance and Management, Changping, Beijing, China; Centre for Environment and Population Health, Nathan Campus, Griffith University, Nathan, Queensland, Australia; Shandong University Climate Change and Health Center, Jinan, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140714,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Animals', 'China/epidemiology', '*Climate', 'Culicidae/*physiology', 'Dengue/epidemiology/*transmission', 'Disease Outbreaks/prevention & control', 'Forecasting', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Humidity', 'Population Density', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Temperature']",PMC4097061,2014/07/16 06:00,2016/01/02 06:00,['2014/07/15 06:00'],"['2014/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/02 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-14-03943 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0102755 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jul 14;9(7):e102755. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0102755. eCollection 2014.,7,,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two types of study were carried out. One was a cross-sectional study for serologically monitoring the population and taking entomological indicators; participants were selected from the general population by random conglomerate sampling. The second study consisted of monitoring febrile cases suspected of dengue during a four-week period. Vector behaviour (bite-rate and hours of activity) was also included by using the landing-on-humans technique; a rubbish-collecting day was run during the same period for evaluating this intervention's short-term effectiveness. RESULTS: Total prevalence of infection by dengue (IgG positive) was 23.3% in 252 people examined in the surveyed population. Household infestation index was 32.9%; deposit index was 8.4%; and Breteau index was 43.9. Following the rubbish-collection day, the infestation index became reduced by 56% (14.5% post-intervention), deposit index by 43% (4.8% post-intervention) and Breteau index by 59% (17.9% post-intervention). Two of the febrile patients (n=83) were IgM positive. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that dengue's urban vector can reach dangerous levels of infestation above 1700 masl; however, a deeper study of its bionomy is needed at these heights above sea-level during different times of the year for improving knowledge regarding climatic and environmental factors affecting their efficiency as vector in these conditions.","['Rodriguez, Hernan', 'de la Hoz, Fernando']","['Rodriguez H', 'de la Hoz F']",,['Secretaria de Salud de Cundinamarca. mamanu123@hotmail.com'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Colombia,Rev Salud Publica (Bogota),"Revista de salud publica (Bogota, Colombia)",100936348,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Aedes/physiology', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colombia/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Insect Vectors/physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Seasons', 'Sentinel Surveillance', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",,2005/05/24 09:00,2005/06/18 09:00,['2005/05/24 09:00'],"['2005/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0124-00642005000100001 [pii]', '10.1590/s0124-00642005000100001 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Salud Publica (Bogota). 2005 Jan-Apr;7(1):1-15. doi: 10.1590/s0124-00642005000100001.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such case-area targeted interventions (CATI) have become an increasingly popular approach for dengue control but there is little evidence to suggest how precisely targeted or how recent cases need to be, to mount an effective response. The growing interest in the development of prophylactic and therapeutic drugs for dengue has also given new relevance for CATI strategies to interrupt transmission or deliver early treatment. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we develop a patch-based mathematical model of spatial dengue spread and fit it to spatiotemporal datasets from Singapore. Simulations from this model suggest CATI strategies could be effective, particularly if used in lower density areas. To maximise effectiveness, increasing the size of the radius around an index case should be prioritised even if it results in delays in the intervention being applied. This is partially because large intervention radii ensure individuals receive multiple and regular rounds of drug dosing or vector control, and thus boost overall coverage. Given equivalent efficacy, CATIs using prophylactic drugs are predicted to be more effective than adult mosquito-killing vector control methods and may even offer the possibility of interrupting individual chains of transmission if rapidly deployed. CATI strategies quickly lose their effectiveness if baseline transmission increases or case detection rates fall. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest CATI strategies can play an important role in dengue control but are likely to be most relevant for low transmission areas where high coverage of other non-reactive interventions already exists. Controlled field trials are needed to assess the field efficacy and practical constraints of large operational CATI strategies.","['Brady, Oliver J', 'Kucharski, Adam J', 'Funk, Sebastian', 'Jafari, Yalda', 'Loock, Marnix Van', 'Herrera-Taracena, Guillermo', 'Menten, Joris', 'Edmunds, W John', 'Sim, Shuzhen', 'Ng, Lee-Ching', 'Hue, Stephane', 'Hibberd, Martin L']","['Brady OJ', 'Kucharski AJ', 'Funk S', 'Jafari Y', 'Loock MV', 'Herrera-Taracena G', 'Menten J', 'Edmunds WJ', 'Sim S', 'Ng LC', 'Hue S', 'Hibberd ML']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3235-2129', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8814-9421', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2842-3406', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4151-4588', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6033-0915', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6925-6683', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9179-2917', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8580-6905']","['Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Public Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Public Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Public Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Public Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Janssen Global Public Health, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Beerse, Belgium.', 'Janssen Global Public Health, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Horsham, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Quantitative Sciences, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Beerse, Belgium.', 'Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Public Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Environmental Health Institute, National Environment Agency, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Environmental Health Institute, National Environment Agency, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Public Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Infectious Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210811,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Animals', '*Case Management', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/prevention & control/*therapy/transmission', 'Disease Outbreaks/prevention & control', 'Humans', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Mosquito Control/methods', 'Regression Analysis', 'Singapore']",PMC8357181,2021/08/12 06:00,2021/11/17 06:00,['2021/08/11 17:19'],"['2020/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/11 17:19 [entrez]', '2021/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['PNTD-D-20-02174 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0009562 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2021 Aug 11;15(8):e0009562. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009562. eCollection 2021 Aug.,8,,,,"[""I have read the journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript have the"", 'following competing interests: MVL, GHT and JM are employees of Johnson &', 'Johnson.

Effective prevention and control programs will depend on improved surveillance designed to provide early warning of dengue epidemics. This article outlines a reasonable approach to dengue surveillance of this kind. Virologic surveillance should be considered the most important element in any such early warning system. Dengue virus transmission should be monitored to determine which serotypes are present, their distribution, and the type of illnesses associated with each. Other key components of an active surveillance system should include monitoring of fever activity and clinical surveillance for cases of severe and fatal disease associated with viral syndromes. Collectively, these three surveillance components can provide an early warning capability permitting emergency mosquito control measures to be implemented and major epidemics to be averted.","['Gubler, D J']",['Gubler DJ'],,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Bull Pan Am Health Organ,Bulletin of the Pan American Health Organization,7505403,,IM,"['Dengue/*diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Puerto Rico']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Pan Am Health Organ. 1989;23(4):397-404.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective analytical study over 1 year and 2 months. SETTING: Tertiary care center. PARTICIPANTS: 350 children aged 1 mo-12 y with serologically confirmed dengue without co-morbidities/co-infections; conse-cutive sampling. PROCEDURE: At admission, clinical and laboratory details were noted. Disease progression, time of onset of each warning sign, hematocrit, and platelet counts were recorded daily till discharge/ death. If progressing to severe dengue, its time of onset was noted. Time to event analysis with Log Rank test, Kaplan Meier plots and Cox Proportional Hazards Model was done. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was time interval from onset of first warning sign to onset of severe dengue (defined as per WHO 2009 guidelines). Predictors were WHO 2009 warning signs: abdominal pain, lethargy, persistent vomiting, mucosal bleed, clinical fluid accumulation, hepatomegaly >2 cm, hematocrit >/=0.40 and platelet count <100x109/L. RESULTS: Among 350 children followed up completely till discharge/death, 90 developed severe dengue (event) while 260 did not (censored). Median age of study population was 7.75 y. Clinical fluid accumulation [(P=0.002, Hazard Ratio (HR) 2.19, 95% CI 1.33-3.60)] and hematocrit >/=0.40 [(P=0.009, HR (95%CI) 1.715, (1.13-2.60)] were significant in univariate analysis. Final multivariate model includes clinical fluid accumulation [(P=0.02, HR (95%CI) 1.89, (1.116-3.202)], hematocrit >/=0.40 (P=0.07), mucosal bleed (P=0.56) and persistent vomiting (P=0.32). CONCLUSION: WHO warning signs that predict time taken for progression to severe dengue in children include clinical fluid accumulation, hematocrit >/=0.40, persistent vomiting and mucosal bleed.

Of the latter, 17 patients had been classified as DF and 33 as DHF by the WHO criteria. From this analysis, haemorrhages and decreased platelets counts associated with hepatic disorders are the main criteria associated with the severe dengue cases. Thus in our study population, the WHO classification does not account for the overall severity of dengue; hepatic failure should be considered as a specific severe form of dengue since plasma leakage, which is the pathophysiological hallmark of DHF, is only one of the pathogenic mechanisms leading to severity.","['Murgue, B', 'Deparis, X', 'Chungue, E', 'Cassar, O', 'Roche, C']","['Murgue B', 'Deparis X', 'Chungue E', 'Cassar O', 'Roche C']",,"['Unite de Virologie, Institut Territorial de Recherches de Medicales Louis Malarde, Papeete, Tahiti, French Polynesia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Trop Med Int Health,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,9610576,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/classification/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Female', 'Hematocrit', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Polynesia/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Serologic Tests', 'Severe Dengue/classification/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Severity of Illness Index']",,1999/12/10 00:00,1999/12/10 00:01,['1999/12/10 00:00'],"['1999/12/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/12/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/12/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['tmi478 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-3156.1999.00478.x [doi]']",ppublish,Trop Med Int Health. 1999 Nov;4(11):765-73. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3156.1999.00478.x.,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The classic presentation of dengue fever has expanded its horizon by involving different organ systems, and these system-specific presentations pose a diagnostic dilemma. The objective of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the sociodemographic, and clinical profile of expanded dengue syndrome (EDS) patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Data were collected from all admitted patients from April 2019 to September 2019 and diagnosed with dengue. The patients with dengue having EDS were followed up till discharge. Of 4200 dengue cases admitted during this period, 108 patients (2.57%) were diagnosed with EDS. Among the EDS cases, 94% were from Dhaka city, and 6% were outside Dhaka city; 66% of the patients were male. Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations were the most common (87%) type of EDS, and among the GI presentations, acute acalculous cholecystitis (38.3%), acute pancreatitis (30.85%), acute hepatitis (21.27%) were the most frequent. Among the EDS cases, 5.55% had a central nervous system (CNS), 4.6% cardiovascular (CVS), and 1.88% had renal complications; 0.93% presented with myositis. The majority (90.74%) of the patients recovered with conservative management, 10 (9.26%) died.

This study aimed to assess the level of readiness and response toward the 2019 dengue fever outbreak in Kassala at the state and community levels. METHODS: This exploratory cross-sectional study was conducted in Kassala State, Sudan, from January to March 2020. The researcher conducted interviews with the key respondents at the state level to assess the level of readiness and response and to reflect the capacity of institutions-public health authorities, health systems, and emergency response bodies. RESULTS: The surveillance system reported 3961 DF cases in Kassala State, representing 93.5% of the total cases in Sudan between August 2019 and January 2020. This outbreak was identified by passive surveillance, 51 samples were tested during the outbreak period, and private clinics and labs were not included in the surveillance system. According to the WHO checklist of outbreak readiness and response, Kassala's surveillance system and public health laboratory received the lowest scores. CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that outbreak readiness and response could be considered below standards, mainly in the surveillance system and laboratory diagnostic facilities, due to the absence of intersectoral collaboration with a regulatory framework in terms of financial and operational participation.","['Bagahizel, Abdulla M', 'Elkhatim, Hamadnalla Sir']","['Bagahizel AM', 'Elkhatim HS']",,"['College of Medicine, Hadhramout University, Mukalla, Yemen. abdullabagahizel@gmail.com.', 'University of Medical Sciences and Technology, Khartoum, Sudan. abdullabagahizel@gmail.com.', 'University of Medical Sciences and Technology, Khartoum, Sudan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20231030,England,BMC Public Health,BMC public health,100968562,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', '*Dengue/epidemiology/prevention & control/diagnosis', '*Dengue Virus', 'Sudan/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Disease Outbreaks/prevention & control']",PMC10614372,2023/10/30 06:47,2023/10/31 06:42,['2023/10/30 00:20'],"['2023/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2023/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/10/31 06:42 [medline]', '2023/10/30 06:47 [pubmed]', '2023/10/30 00:20 [entrez]']","['10.1186/s12889-023-17020-9 [pii]', '17020 [pii]', '10.1186/s12889-023-17020-9 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Public Health. 2023 Oct 30;23(1):2122. doi: 10.1186/s12889-023-17020-9.,1,['(c) 2023.

Vector-borne diseases are an important part of infectious diseases. Dengue fever is one of the travel-related infections that has been reported increasingly in recent years through the development of diagnostic methods. The aim of this report was to present two Dengue fever cases originating from travel. There was a story of mosquito bite during a trip to Sri Lanka travel in our first case. The patient was 30 years old and maculopapular rash appeared on the fifth day of contact. Three days after the onset of the rash, she has admitted to our clinic, complaining with fever and chills. Increased leukopenia and muscle enzymes were detected in the laboratory analysis. Real-time reverse transcriptase polimerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was positive in the serum sample. The patient was followed up with supportive care and discharged by improvement. The second case, a 24-year-old male, had a story of mosquito bite during his trip to Malaysia. After the patient complained of fever, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting and muscle pain, the Dengue virus (DENV) NS1 antigen test performed in this country was found to be positive. In the second case, there was no maculopapular rash and laboratory analysis showed an increase in leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and muscle enzymes. RT-PCR positivity was detected in the serum sample. The patient was followed up with supportive treatment and discharged with cure. DENV infections are caused by DENV which is common in the tropical areas of the world. There are four DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 serotypes. DENV infections can present different clinical manifestations such as asymptomatic disease, viral syndrome, Dengue haemorrhagic fever, and Dengue shock syndrome. Dengue fever is often accompanied by arthritis, maculopapular rash and high fever. Our cases were defined as Dengue fever according to this definition. In the diagnosis of the disease, it is necessary first to be suspicious of the disease and the travel history must be questioned. In the definitive diagnosis, virus isolation, antigen, nucleic acid detection and serological tests are used. The virus can be isolated from blood, serum, urine and tissues. In the first five days after beginning of the symptoms associated with DENV infections, serum RT-PCR and Dengue NS1 antigen test may be positive.","['Karabay, Oguz', 'Guclu, Ertugrul', 'Simsek, Adem', 'Okan, Huseyin Dogus', 'Ogutlu, Aziz', 'Cosgun, Yasemin', 'Menemenlioglu, Dilek']","['Karabay O', 'Guclu E', 'Simsek A', 'Okan HD', 'Ogutlu A', 'Cosgun Y', 'Menemenlioglu D']",,"['Sakarya University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Sakarya, Turkey.', 'Sakarya University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Sakarya, Turkey.', 'Sakarya University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Sakarya, Turkey.', 'Sakarya University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Sakarya, Turkey.', 'Sakarya University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Sakarya, Turkey.', 'Public Health General Directorate of Turkey, Department of Microbiology Reference and Biological Products Laboratories, National Arboviruses and Viral Zoonoses Laboratory, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Sakarya University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Sakarya, Turkey.']",['tur'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Turkey,Mikrobiyol Bul,Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,7503830,,IM,"['Adult', '*Dengue/complications/diagnosis/pathology/virology', '*Dengue Virus/classification', 'Exanthema/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Malaysia', 'Male', 'Sri Lanka', '*Travel-Related Illness', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2019/08/16 06:00,2019/09/19 06:00,['2019/08/16 06:00'],"['2019/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5578/mb.68050 [doi]'],ppublish,Mikrobiyol Bul. 2019 Jul;53(3):348-353. doi: 10.5578/mb.68050.,3,,,,,,,,,Seyahat Iliskili Ates ve Dokuntu: Iki Dengue Atesi Olgusu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Taman Samudera, dengue cases were reported monthly in 2003/2004. Thus, a study was initiated to determine the distribution and abundance of dengue vectors, Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus. The ovitrap surveillance indicated that Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were present both indoors and outdoors. The residential sites had 73 - 79% of the ovitraps with just Ae. aegypti population and Kg. Banjar had 56% of the ovitraps with just Ae. aegypti. In the indoor and outdoor of the residential areas, together with the settlement area, the Ae. aegypti density was significantly more than Ae. albopictus (p < 0.05) by 3 - 50 folds. There was no significant difference in the larval numbers of Ae. aegypti between indoors and outdoors (p > 0.05), thus implicating that adult gravid female Ae. aegypti are present both indoors and outdoors and they do oviposit indoors and outdoors. Ae. aegypti can be incriminated as the principal dengue vector in the urban residential site, Taman Samudera and in the settlement area, Kg.

METHODS: During a recent outbreak of dengue fever in Uttar Pradesh, India, we looked for evidence of liver dysfunction among patients with dengue fever. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients with dengue fever (age 7-65 [median 33] years; 29 men; 39 adults) were studied, including 23 with uncomplicated dengue fever, 15 with dengue haemorrhagic fever and 7 with dengue shock syndrome. The median platelet count was 34 x 10(9)/L (9-99 x 10(9)). Seven patients (15%) had jaundice, 11 (24%) hepatomegaly and 9 clinically detectable ascites; none had splenomegaly. Twelve patients (30%) had hyperbilirubinaemia. Serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferase activities were elevated in 43 patients (96%) each; 5-fold elevated levels were more frequent in severe disease. Hypoalbuminaemia was found in 31/41 patients (76%). Seven patients died, including 2 with acute liver failure. CONCLUSION: Our data show that liver injury is common in adult patients with dengue infection. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism of liver injury in this disease.","['Itha, Srivenu', 'Kashyap, Rajesh', 'Krishnani, Narendra', 'Saraswat, Vivek A', 'Choudhuri, Gourdas', 'Aggarwal, Rakesh']","['Itha S', 'Kashyap R', 'Krishnani N', 'Saraswat VA', 'Choudhuri G', 'Aggarwal R']",,"['Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rae Bareli Road, Lucknow 226014, Uttar Pradesh, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Natl Med J India,The National medical journal of India,8809315,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Dengue/*complications/epidemiology/physiopathology', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Liver Diseases/*etiology', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2005/09/01 09:00,2005/11/03 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Natl Med J India. 2005 May-Jun;18(3):127-30.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Almost one-third of these cases were children. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical and hematological manifestations of pediatric dengue cases during the epidemic. This was a multicenter cross-sectional study conducted in Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Dhaka, Dr. Sirajul Islam Medical College Hospital and Tangail Sadar Hospital, Tangail, Bangladesh between the period of June 2019 and September 2019. The study included 208 pediatric patients (age <18 years) with confirmed dengue fever. Patient's demographics, clinical and laboratory features of dengue were collected through patients' interview, clinical examination and laboratory investigations. Descriptive statistics were used to represent the patients' socio-demographic information, clinical presentations and hematological parameters. The majority of the patients were aged between 6 and 17 years with male predominance. The most commonly presented clinical manifestations were fever (100.0%), headache (59.0%), myalgia (42.0%), rash (36.0%), retro-orbital pain (28.0%) and diarrhea (24.0%). Warning signs abdominal pain (40.0%) and persistent vomiting (29.0%), bleeding manifestations such as melena (17.0%), gum bleeding (7.0%) and epistaxis (6.0%) and evidence of plasma leakage such as oliguria (3.4%), ascites (2.4%), pleural effusion (1.4%), and shock (1.0%) were also present in the patients. Raised HCT levels, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia were present in almost 23.0%, 43.0% and 28.0% of children, respectively. Warning signs and plasma leakage were present in a substantial number of patients indicating potential risk of severe dengue.

The current notification system has considerable inevitable delays in preventive measures. OBJECTIVES: Implementing a laboratory-based real-time antigen (NS1) surveillance system for notification coupled with a rapid preventive response within the Colombo district as a pilot project and compares the notifications with existing national surveillance systems. METHODS: An online notification platform was established with a centralized database. Seven main laboratories of the private sector linked with the notification system, where they can create new notifications at the central database, whenever the NS1 test detected as positive. Relevant Medical Officers of Health should update action implemented to complete the response process. A dashboard was designed to visualize each notification and its status with a predefined colour code. RESULTS: Patients from 14 Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas out of 15 were captured.

Overall skills for diagnosis and management have improved owing to national awareness for the disease. We have observed and investigated the frequency of glucose intolerance in the early phase of dengue fever. A two-sampled challenge test by 75 gm oral glucose (OGTT) was done in 133 patients [age (mean+/-SD):33+/-13 years, sex (male/female): 97/36] suffering from dengue fever during their illness. Diagnosis of dengue was based on serologic test for anti-dengue antibodies after the first week. Other investigations were done as part of the management. Among 133 studied dengue patients, 100 were found to have glucose intolerance by OGTT (75.2%). In regards to intensity of intolerance, 21.1%(28/133) had diabetes while 54.1%(72/133) had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Among the patients who agreed for a second OGTT (n=40) during discharge, 11(28%) had normal OGTT at both events, 22(55%) revert to normal on second OGTT while 7(17.5%) persisted abnormal glucose intolerance. On regression analysis, glucose intolerance was independently related to increased age (p=0.001) and higher titre of IgG antibody (p=0.006). The study demonstrated that glucose intolerance is frequently associated with dengue fever in its early course. These findings may help for the early diagnosis of dengue fever; and warrants for avoidance of dextrose infusions as fluid replacement in dengue fever. Moreover, patients suffering from dengue fever should be cautioned for development of diabetes in future.","['Hasanat, M A', 'Ananna, M A', 'Ahmed, M U', 'Alam, M N']","['Hasanat MA', 'Ananna MA', 'Ahmed MU', 'Alam MN']",,"['Dr MA Hasanat, Department of Endocrine Medicine, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Shahbagh, Dhaka, Bangladesh. hasanatdr@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Bangladesh,Mymensingh Med J,Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,9601799,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Glucose/*analysis', 'Contraindications', 'Dengue/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Fluid Therapy/methods', 'Glucose', 'Glucose Intolerance/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Male']",,2010/07/20 06:00,2011/02/24 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Mymensingh Med J. 2010 Jul;19(3):382-5.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We fitted the data of accumulated infections and used the parameterized model to carry out a retrospective analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number 1.7425 (95% CI 1.4443-2.0408), the control reproduction number 0.1709, and the mosquito-killing ratios 0.1978, 0.2987, 0.6158 and 0.5571 on October 3, 10, 17 and 24, respectively. This suggests that integrated intervention is highly effective in controlling the dengue outbreak. We also simulated outbreak outcomes under different variations of the implemented interventions. We showed that skipping one Friday for vector control would not result in raising the control reproduction number to the threshold value 1 but would lead to significant increase in the accumulated infections at the end of the outbreak. The findings indicate that quick and persistent impulsive implementation of vector control result in an effective reduction in the control reproduction number and hence lead to significant decline of new infections.","['Tang, Biao', 'Xiao, Yanni', 'Tang, Sanyi', 'Wu, Jianhong']","['Tang B', 'Xiao Y', 'Tang S', 'Wu J']",,"[""School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, PR China; Centre for Disease Modelling, York Institute for Health Research, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada M3J 1P3."", ""School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, PR China.

I used SIR models to investigate the epidemiological role of such infections, by adding an asymptomatic class (SAIR models). Upon infection in one of the models, a human becomes either symptomatic or asymptomatic. In the other, a human becomes asymptomatic and may progress to being symptomatic. The robustness of results from these models is examined by incorporating the mosquito-vector into one of the models, followed by simulating epidemic dynamics stochastically. Results from the first two models were very similar, with epidemics typically lasting less than one year. When mosquitoes were explicitly modelled in a high-transmission setting, if the level or duration of infectivity from asymptomatic infections was high relative to symptomatic infections, dengue would become endemic. Under stochastic simulation this effect of asymptomatic infections leading to dengue persisting was no longer guaranteed. Longer durations in asymptomatic infections had a higher chance of causing dengue's persistence in stochastic simulation, indicating that this may be more of a key determinant for dengue's persistence to 10 years than the infectivity of such infections. Otherwise, the level and duration of infectivity from asymptomatic infections had similar effects on R(0) and other epidemiological measures. With all models, outbreaks often led to a larger proportion of the population being immune than suggested by monitoring symptomatic dengue infections. This population would be at risk of developing severe dengue in a subsequent outbreak with a different dengue serotype, and would have to be determined via expansion factors.","['Grunnill, Martin']",['Grunnill M'],,"['Center for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus, Penryn, Cornwall TR10 9FE, United Kingdom; USGS National Wildlife Health Center, 6006 Schroeder Road, Madison, WI 53711-6223, United States of America.

The findings of well conducted epidemiological studies allow not only assessment of morbidity and mortality in endemic areas and early detection of epidemic outbreaks but also evaluation of socioeconomic impact and effectiveness of control measures.

Once vaccine is available, policy-makers will need to develop suitable policies to allocate the vaccine. Mathematical models of dengue transmission predict complex temporal patterns in prevalence, driven by seasonal oscillations in mosquito abundance. In particular, vaccine introduction may induce a transient period immediately after vaccine introduction where prevalence can spike higher than in the pre-vaccination period. These spikes in prevalence could lead to doubts about the vaccination programme among the public and even among decision-makers, possibly impeding the vaccination programme. Using simple dengue transmission models, we found that large transient spikes in prevalence are robust phenomena that occur when vaccine coverage and vaccine efficacy are not either both very high or both very low. Despite the presence of transient spikes in prevalence, the models predict that vaccination does always reduce the total number of infections in the 15 years after vaccine introduction. We conclude that policy-makers should prepare for spikes in prevalence after vaccine introduction to mitigate the burden of these spikes and to accurately measure the effectiveness of the vaccine programme.","['Pandey, A', 'Medlock, J']","['Pandey A', 'Medlock J']",,"['Department of Mathematical Sciences,Clemson University,Clemson, SC,USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences,Oregon State University,Corvallis, OR,USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140811,England,Epidemiol Infect,Epidemiology and infection,8703737,['0 (Dengue Vaccines)'],IM,"['Dengue/*epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission', 'Dengue Vaccines/*therapeutic use', 'Dengue Virus', 'Humans', 'Immunization Programs/methods', 'Models, Statistical', 'Prevalence']",PMC9507178,2014/08/12 06:00,2015/05/06 06:00,['2014/08/12 06:00'],"['2014/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0950268814001939 [pii]', '00193 [pii]', '10.1017/S0950268814001939 [doi]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Infect. 2015 Apr;143(6):1276-86. doi: 10.1017/S0950268814001939.

A handful of studies have taken initiatives to evaluate the old and revised guidelines to determine early signs and symptoms of severe dengue. This retrospective study aimed to compare the classification of dengue using both the 1997 and 2009 guidelines in a selected cohort of dengue patients from Peninsular Malaysia between 2008 and 2012. METHODOLOGY: Adult dengue patients were recruited from tertiary hospitals in two different states, Selangor and Kelantan, in Peninsular Malaysia. Their clinical manifestations were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 281 confirmed dengue patients were enrolled; the mean duration of illness at admission was five days. Of these, 88.6%, 10.7%, and 0.7% were classified according to the 1997 guidelines as having dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), respectively. When the WHO 2009 guidelines were applied, 17.1%, 78.3%, and 4.6% were classified as dengue without warning signs, dengue with warning signs, and severe dengue, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that the revised WHO 2009 guidelines stratify a much larger proportion of patients into a category that requires a higher level of medical and nursing care.","['Zakaria, Zuraihan', 'Zainordin, Nur A', 'Sim, Benedict L H', 'Zaid, Masliza', 'Haridan, Umi S', 'Aziz, Abu T A', 'Shueb, Rafidah H', 'Mustafa, Mahiran', 'Yusoff, Nik K N', 'Malik, Alam S', 'Lee, Christopher K C', 'Abubakar, Sazaly', 'Hoh, Boon Peng']","['Zakaria Z', 'Zainordin NA', 'Sim BL', 'Zaid M', 'Haridan US', 'Aziz AT', 'Shueb RH', 'Mustafa M', 'Yusoff NK', 'Malik AS', 'Lee CK', 'Abubakar S', 'Hoh BP']",,"['Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Sungai Buloh, Selangor, Malaysia. zuraihanzakaria@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140714,Italy,J Infect Dev Ctries,Journal of infection in developing countries,101305410,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Dengue/*classification/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Female', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Malaysia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severe Dengue/classification/diagnosis/etiology', 'World Health Organization', 'Young Adult']",,2014/07/16 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2014/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3855/jidc.4283 [doi]'],epublish,J Infect Dev Ctries. 2014 Jul 14;8(7):869-75. doi: 10.3855/jidc.4283.,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is endemic in most tropical and sub-tropical countries, which are also popular tourist destinations. Travelers are at significant risk of acquiring the disease and also contribute to its spread to non-endemic countries where the vector is present. Children represent a particular susceptible category, since they have a higher risk than adults of developing severe dengue. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe 3 cases of imported dengue fever in Italy in three children (two born in the Philippines and one of Bangladeshi ethnicity) who acquired dengue fever during a recent travel to Southeast Asia, initially not-recognized because of the low index of suspicion of physicians not working in dengue endemic areas. Clinical presentations, differential diagnosis and management of these children are presented and discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Due to global urbanization and increased air travel, it is nowadays important that physicians who practice outside of traditionally dengue endemic areas are adept at the recognition of potentially fatal reemerging infectious diseases such as dengue.","['Buonsenso, Danilo', 'Barone, Giovanni', 'Onesimo, Roberta', 'Calzedda, Roberta', 'Chiaretti, Antonio', 'Valentini, Piero']","['Buonsenso D', 'Barone G', 'Onesimo R', 'Calzedda R', 'Chiaretti A', 'Valentini P']",,"['Pediatric Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Catholic University A, Gemelli Hospital, L,go A, Gemelli 8, 00168 Rome, Italy. danilobuonsenso@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20140903,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Bangladesh/ethnology', 'Child', '*Communicable Diseases, Emerging', 'Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy/*transmission/virology', 'Dengue Virus/*pathogenicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Philippines/ethnology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Risk Factors', 'Travel', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4174650,2014/09/05 06:00,2015/06/11 06:00,['2014/09/05 06:00'],"['2013/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-0500-7-596 [pii]', '3169 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-0500-7-596 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2014 Sep 3;7:596. doi: 10.1186/1756-0500-7-596.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such difficulties could be due to the low awareness of the World Health Organization diagnostic guidelines among clinicians. OBJECTIVE: To study the diagnostic practices of clinicians in classifying patients as dengue fever (DF) or dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS) at the time of discharge during an outbreak. METHODS: A prospective descriptive study of clinical features and disease classification in adult and pediatric dengue patients in the University of Malaya Medical Centre. RESULTS: Five hundred and twenty adult and 191 pediatric patients were enrolled. Thrombocytopenia and evidence of plasma leakage were present in 8% of adult and 19% of pediatric patients. Of these, 93% and 49%, respectively, were given the discharge diagnoses of DF instead of DHF/DSS. Hemoconcentration, serous effusion and thrombocytopenia were not recognized in clinicians' discharge diagnosis of DHF/DSS for adult patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve suggested a lack of consistency in the use of WHO guidelines in establishing DHF/DSS in adult patients, while implying otherwise for pediatric patients. CONCLUSION: DHF/DSS is an under-recognized condition by clinicians managing these patients. This can affect the case fatality rate of DHF/DSS and the economic burden of the disease. The lack of awareness in disease manifestations especially plasma leakage, can lead to delayed recognition of DHF/DSS.","['Ng, Chris Fook Sheng', 'Lum, Lucy Chai See', 'Ismail, Noor Azina', 'Tan, Lian Huat', 'Tan, Christina Phoay Lay']","['Ng CF', 'Lum LC', 'Ismail NA', 'Tan LH', 'Tan CP']",,"['Department of Applied Statistics, Faculty of Economics and Administration, University of Malaya, Malaysia. chrisng@um.edu.my']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,J Clin Virol,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,9815671,,IM,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/classification/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/physiopathology', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Humans', 'Malaysia/epidemiology', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'ROC Curve', 'Severe Dengue/classification/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'World Health Organization']",,2007/10/12 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/10/12 09:00'],"['2007/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/18 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1386-6532(07)00303-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jcv.2007.08.017 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Virol. 2007 Nov;40(3):202-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jcv.2007.08.017.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From January 2013 to July 2015, we prospectively studied 162 hospitalized adults with confirmed dengue viral infection using non-invasive cardiac output monitoring and bedside ultrasonography to determine changes in hemodynamic and IVC parameters and identify the types of circulatory shock that occur in patients with dengue. Of 162 patients with dengue, 17 (10.5%) experienced dengue shock and 145 (89.5%) did not. In patients with shock, the mean arterial pressure was significantly lower on day 6 after fever onset (P = 0.045) and the pulse pressure was significantly lower between days 4 and 7 (P<0.05). The stroke volume index and cardiac index were significantly decreased between days 4 and 15 and between days 5 and 8 after fever onset (P<0.05), respectively. A significant proportion of patients with dengue shock had an IVC diameter <1.5 cm and IVC collapsibility index >50% between days 4 and 5 (P<0.05). Hypovolemic shock was observed in 9 (52.9%) patients and cardiogenic shock in 8 (47.1%), with a median (interquartile range) time to shock onset of 6.0 (5.0-6.5) days after fever onset, which was the median day of defervescence. Intravascular hypovolemia occurred before defervescence, whereas myocardial dysfunction occurred on the day of defervescence until 2 weeks after fever onset. Hypovolemic shock and cardiogenic shock each occurred in approximately half of the patients with dengue shock. Therefore, dynamic measures to estimate changes in hemodynamic parameters and preload should be monitored to ensure adequate fluid therapy among patients with dengue, particularly patients with dengue shock.","['Thanachartwet, Vipa', 'Wattanathum, Anan', 'Sahassananda, Duangjai', 'Wacharasint, Petch', 'Chamnanchanunt, Supat', 'Khine Kyaw, Ei', 'Jittmittraphap, Akanitt', 'Naksomphun, Mali', 'Surabotsophon, Manoon', 'Desakorn, Varunee']","['Thanachartwet V', 'Wattanathum A', 'Sahassananda D', 'Wacharasint P', 'Chamnanchanunt S', 'Khine Kyaw E', 'Jittmittraphap A', 'Naksomphun M', 'Surabotsophon M', 'Desakorn V']",,"['Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.', 'Pulmonary and Critical Care Division, Department of Medicine, Phramongkutklao Hospital, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.', 'Information Technology Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.', 'Critical Care Division, Department of Anesthesiology, Phramongkutklao Hospital, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.', 'Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.', 'Pulmonary and Critical Care Division, Department of Medicine, Ramkhamhaeng Hospital, Bangkok 10240, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160519,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adult', 'Dengue/complications/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging', 'Female', 'Heart Function Tests', '*Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Shock/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Ultrasonography']",PMC4873173,2016/05/20 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2016/05/20 06:00'],"['2015/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-15-54436 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0156135 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 May 19;11(5):e0156135. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0156135. eCollection 2016.,5,,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Total costs included both direct costs from medical expenditures and prevention activities and indirect costs from lost productivity. The annual disease burden ranged from 99 to 805 DALYs per million, with a majority associated with classic dengue fever. The total cost was estimated to be US$13.5 million/year (range: US$5.1-27.6 million). This analysis can help improve allocation of dengue control resources in Nicaragua and the region.

Timely and appropriate management is critical to reduce morbidity. Since 1980, dengue has spread throughout Brazil, affecting an increasing number of individuals. This paper describes age and regional differences in dengue's clinical presentation and associated risk of hospitalization based on more than 5 million cases reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health from 2000-2014. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of  approximately 5,450,000 dengue cases, relating clinical manifestations and the risk of hospitalization to age, gender, previous infection by dengue, dengue virus serotype, years of formal education, delay to first attendance and the occurrence of dengue during outbreaks and in different Brazilian regions. RESULTS: Complicated forms of dengue occurred more frequently among those younger than 10 years (3.12% vs 1.92%) and those with dengue virus 2 infection (7.65% vs 2.42%), with a delay to first attendance >2 days (3.18% vs 0.82%) and with </=4 years of formal education (2.02% vs 1.46%). The risk of hospitalization was higher among those aged 6-10 years old (OR 4.57; 95% CI 1.43-29.96) and those who were infected by dengue virus 2 (OR 6.36; 95% CI 2.52-16.06), who lived in the Northeast region (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.11-2.10) and who delayed first attendance by >5 days (composite OR 3.15; 95% CI 1.33-8.9). CONCLUSIONS: In Brazil, the occurrence of severe dengue and related hospitalization is associated with being younger than 10 years old, being infected by dengue virus 2 or 3, living in the Northeast region (the poorest and the second most populated) and delaying first attendance for more than 2 days.","['Burattini, Marcelo N', 'Lopez, Luis F', 'Coutinho, Francisco A B', 'Siqueira, Joao B Jr', 'Homsani, Sheila', 'Sarti, Elsa', 'Massad, Eduardo']","['Burattini MN', 'Lopez LF', 'Coutinho FA', 'Siqueira JB Jr', 'Homsani S', 'Sarti E', 'Massad E']",,"['Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Divisao de Informatica Medica, Sao Paulo/SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Sao Paulo, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Sao Paulo/SP, Brazil.', 'Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Divisao de Informatica Medica, Sao Paulo/SP, Brazil.', 'CIARA, Florida International University, Miami, Florida, United States of America.', 'Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Divisao de Informatica Medica, Sao Paulo/SP, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Goias, Instituto Tropical de Patologia e Saude Publica, Goiania/GO, Brazil.', 'Sanofi Pasteur, Sao Paulo/SP, Brazil.', 'Sanofi Pasteur Latinoamerica, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Divisao de Informatica Medica, Sao Paulo/SP, Brazil.', 'London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clinics (Sao Paulo),"Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",101244734,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/complications/*epidemiology', 'Dengue Virus', 'Epidemics', 'Female', 'Geographic Mapping', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Distribution', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC4975787,2016/09/15 06:00,2017/06/29 06:00,['2016/09/15 06:00'],"['2015/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S1807-5932(22)01070-5 [pii]', 'cln_71p455 [pii]', '10.6061/clinics/2016(08)08 [doi]']",ppublish,Clinics (Sao Paulo). 2016 Aug;71(8):455-63. doi: 10.6061/clinics/2016(08)08.,8,,,,['No potential conflict of interest was reported.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

International travel and an increasing incidence of dengue fever in tropical areas have defined the disease as an emerging infection in returning travellers. We describe the clinical and microbiological features of imported dengue in 3 referral hospitals in Spain. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We included patients diagnosed with dengue infection during a 3-year period (2002--2005). We recorded clinical and epidemiological data and collected blood samples for serological and molecular studies of dengue infection. Data was analyzed with the statistical package Stata 9.2. RESULTS: We diagnosed 61 dengue cases, mostly European tourists who travelled to Latin America. Fever was found in 98.4% of patients and 80.3% presented with cutaneous eruption. Five patients had severe symptoms. Eighteen percent were considered to have secondary infections, although no patients met the WHO criteria for hemorrhagic dengue. In 26 cases, dengue was confirmed through viral genome detection and 35 cases through serology. Four patients were considered as <<probable>> dengue infection, and 57 as <<confirmed>>. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue is a common diagnosis for returning travellers, and it may present with severe manifestations. In our sample, there was an elevated percentage of secondary infections even though no previous history of dengue was reported by the patients. Hemorrhagic dengue and septic shock dengue are a risk for travellers returning from endemic areas.","['Munoz, Jose', 'Puente, Sabino', 'Lopez-Velez, Rogelio', 'Domingo, Cristina', 'Ruiz, Joaquim', 'Ramirez, German', 'Navarro, Miriam', 'de Orye, Fernando', 'Sanz, Sergi', 'Rivas, Pablo', 'Turrientes, M Carmen', 'Tenorio, Antonio', 'Gascon, Joaquim']","['Munoz J', 'Puente S', 'Lopez-Velez R', 'Domingo C', 'Ruiz J', 'Ramirez G', 'Navarro M', 'de Orye F', 'Sanz S', 'Rivas P', 'Turrientes MC', 'Tenorio A', 'Gascon J']",,"['Seccion de Medicina Tropical, Centro de Salud Internacional, IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Espana. jose.munoz@manhica.net']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Travel']",,2008/06/28 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/06/28 09:00'],"['2008/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['13123037 [pii]', '10.1157/13123037 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 2008 Jun 7;131(1):18-21. doi: 10.1157/13123037.,1,,,,,,,,,Estudio clinicoepidemiologico del dengue importado en Espana.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to identify a dengue weather correlation pattern in Kandy, Sri Lanka, compare the results with results of similar studies, and establish ways for better control and prevention of dengue. METHOD: We collected data on reported dengue cases in Kandy and mid-year population data from 2003 to 2012, and calculated weekly incidences. We obtained daily weather data from two weather stations and converted it into weekly data. We studied correlation patterns between dengue incidence and weather variables using the wavelet time series analysis, and then calculated cross-correlation coefficients to find magnitudes of correlations. RESULTS: We found a positive correlation between dengue incidence and rainfall in millimeters, the number of rainy and wet days, the minimum temperature, and the night and daytime, as well as average, humidity, mostly with a five- to seven-week lag. Additionally, we found correlations between dengue incidence and maximum and average temperatures, hours of sunshine, and wind, with longer lag periods. Dengue incidences showed a negative correlation with wind run. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that rainfall, temperature, humidity, hours of sunshine, and wind are correlated with local dengue incidence. We have suggested ways to improve dengue management routines and to control it in these times of global warming. We also noticed that the results of dengue weather correlation studies can vary depending on the data analysis.","['Ehelepola, N D B', 'Ariyaratne, Kusalika', 'Buddhadasa, W M N P', 'Ratnayake, Sunil', 'Wickramasinghe, Malani']","['Ehelepola ND', 'Ariyaratne K', 'Buddhadasa WM', 'Ratnayake S', 'Wickramasinghe M']",,"['The Teaching (General) Hospital - Kandy, Kandy, Sri Lanka. drehelepola@gmail.com.', 'Faculty of Engineering, University of Ruhuna, Hapugala, Sri Lanka. kusalika@yahoo.com.', 'The Teaching (General) Hospital - Kandy, Kandy, Sri Lanka. namalbuddhadasa@gmail.com.', 'The Teaching (General) Hospital - Kandy, Kandy, Sri Lanka. msskbandara@yahoo.com.', 'The Teaching (General) Hospital - Kandy, Kandy, Sri Lanka. malani0718201970@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",20150924,England,Infect Dis Poverty,Infectious diseases of poverty,101606645,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cities', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/history/prevention & control/transmission', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Rain', 'Seasons', 'Sri Lanka/epidemiology', '*Weather']",PMC4581090,2015/09/26 06:00,2016/04/08 06:00,['2015/09/26 06:00'],"['2015/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40249-015-0075-8 [pii]', '75 [pii]', '10.1186/s40249-015-0075-8 [doi]']",epublish,Infect Dis Poverty. 2015 Sep 24;4:42. doi: 10.1186/s40249-015-0075-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Travellers and the clinicians who advise and treat them have unique needs for understanding the geographic extent of risk for dengue. Specifically, they should assess the need for prevention measures before travel and ensure appropriate treatment of illness post-travel. Previous dengue-risk maps published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Yellow Book lacked specificity, as there was a binary (risk, no risk) classification. We developed a process to compile evidence, evaluate it and apply more informative risk classifications. METHODS: We collected more than 839 observations from official reports, ProMED reports and published scientific research for the period 2005-2014. We classified each location as frequent/continuous risk if there was evidence of more than 10 dengue cases in at least three of the previous 10 years. For locations that did not fit this criterion, we classified locations as sporadic/uncertain risk if the location had evidence of at least one locally acquired dengue case during the last 10 years. We used expert opinion in limited instances to augment available data in areas where data were sparse. RESULTS: Initial categorizations classified 134 areas as frequent/continuous and 140 areas as sporadic/uncertain. CDC subject matter experts reviewed all initial frequent/continuous and sporadic/uncertain categorizations and the previously uncategorized areas. From this review, most categorizations stayed the same; however, 11 categorizations changed from the initial determinations. CONCLUSIONS: These new risk classifications enable detailed consideration of dengue risk, with clearer meaning and a direct link to the evidence that supports the specific classification. Since many infectious diseases have dynamic risk, strong geographical heterogeneities and varying data quality and availability, using this approach for other diseases can improve the accuracy, clarity and transparency of risk communication.","['Jentes, Emily S', 'Lash, R Ryan', 'Johansson, Michael A', 'Sharp, Tyler M', 'Henry, Ronnie', 'Brady, Oliver J', 'Sotir, Mark J', 'Hay, Simon I', 'Margolis, Harold S', 'Brunette, Gary W']","['Jentes ES', 'Lash RR', 'Johansson MA', 'Sharp TM', 'Henry R', 'Brady OJ', 'Sotir MJ', 'Hay SI', 'Margolis HS', 'Brunette GW']",,"['Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1600 Clifton Road, MS E-03, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA ejentes@cdc.gov.', 'Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1600 Clifton Road, MS E-03, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.', 'Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, CDC, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00920.', 'Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, CDC, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00920.', 'Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1600 Clifton Road, MS E-03, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.', 'Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK Oxford Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, Oxford OX3 7BN, UK.', 'Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1600 Clifton Road, MS E-03, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.', 'Oxford Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, Oxford OX3 7BN, UK Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, 2301 Fifth Ave., Suite 600 Seattle, WA 98121.', 'Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, CDC, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00920.', 'Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1600 Clifton Road, MS E-03, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160913,England,J Travel Med,Journal of travel medicine,9434456,,IM,"['Asia, Southeastern/epidemiology', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Dengue Virus', 'Evidence-Based Practice/*organization & administration', 'Humans', '*Travel', 'Travel Medicine/methods', 'Tropical Climate']",PMC5345513,2016/09/15 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2016/09/15 06:00'],"['2016/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['taw062 [pii]', '10.1093/jtm/taw062 [doi]']",epublish,J Travel Med. 2016 Sep 13;23(6):taw062. doi: 10.1093/jtm/taw062.

Frequent epidemic outbreaks are believed to be driven by a complex interplay of immunological interactions between its four co-circulating serotypes and large fluctuations in mosquito densities. Viral lineage replacement events, caused for example by different levels of cross-protection or differences in viral fitness, have also been linked to a temporary change in dengue epidemiology. A major replacement event was recently described for South-East Asia where the Asian-1 genotype of dengue serotype 2 replaced the resident Asian/American type. Although this was proposed to be due to increased viral fitness in terms of enhanced human-to-mosquito transmission, no major change in dengue epidemiology could be observed. METHODS/RESULTS: Here we investigate the invasion dynamics of a novel, advantageous dengue genotype within a model system and determine the factors influencing the success and rate of fixation as well as their epidemiological consequences. We find that while viral fitness overall correlates with invasion success and competitive exclusion of the resident genotype, the epidemiological landscape plays a more significant role for successful emergence. Novel genotypes can thus face high risks of stochastic extinction despite their fitness advantage if they get introduced during episodes of high dengue prevalence, especially with respect to that particular serotype. CONCLUSION: The rarity of markers for positive selection has often been explained by strong purifying selection whereby the constraints imposed by dengue's two-host cycle are expected to result in a high rate of deleterious mutations. Our results demonstrate that even highly beneficial mutants are under severe threat of extinction, which would suggest that apart from purifying selection, stochastic effects and genetic drift beyond seasonal bottlenecks are equally important in shaping dengue's viral ecology and evolution.","['Lourenco, Jose', 'Recker, Mario']","['Lourenco J', 'Recker M']",,"['Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101123,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Americas/epidemiology', 'Asia, Southeastern/epidemiology', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*genetics/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Epidemics', 'Genotype', 'Humans']",PMC2990689,2010/12/03 06:00,2011/04/13 06:00,['2010/12/03 06:00'],"['2010/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10-PNTD-RA-1302R3 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0000894 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2010 Nov 23;4(11):e894. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000894.,11,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With clinical interventions included, 8 cases (6.6%) originally classified as having non-severe dengue infection were reclassified as having severe infection (sensitivity = 74%, specificity = 100%, likelihood ratio (-) = 0.26). Using the new dengue classification system, 117 cases (80.7%) were classified as having non-severe dengue infection, of which 79 (54.5%) were classified as having dengue without warning signs and 38 (26.2%) were classified as having dengue with warning signs, while 28 (19.3%) were classified as having severe dengue infection. Using clinical intervention, 4 cases (3.4%) which were originally classified as having non-severe dengue infection were reclassified as having severe dengue infection (sensitivity = 88%, specificity = 99%, likelihood ratio (+) = 98.88, likelihood ratio (-) = 0.13).

It has previously been proposed that these patterns are due to the phenomenon of the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) among dengue serotypes, whereby viral replication is increased during secondary infection with a heterologous serotype; however, recent studies have implied that this positive reinforcement cannot account for the temporal patterns of dengue and that some form of cross-immunity or external forcing is necessary. Here, we show that ADE alone can produce the observed periodicities and desynchronized oscillations of individual serotypes if its effects are decomposed into its two possible manifestations: enhancement of susceptibility to secondary infections and increased transmissibility from individuals suffering from secondary infections. This decomposition not only lowers the level of enhancement necessary for realistic disease patterns but also reduces the risk of stochastic extinction. Furthermore, our analyses reveal a time-lagged correlation between serotype dynamics and disease incidence rates, which could have important implications for understanding the irregular pattern of dengue epidemics.","['Recker, Mario', 'Blyuss, Konstantin B', 'Simmons, Cameron P', 'Hien, Tran Tinh', 'Wills, Bridget', 'Farrar, Jeremy', 'Gupta, Sunetra']","['Recker M', 'Blyuss KB', 'Simmons CP', 'Hien TT', 'Wills B', 'Farrar J', 'Gupta S']",,"['Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3PS, UK. mario.recker@zoo.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090415,England,Proc Biol Sci,Proceedings.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the use of warning signs (WS) to stratify patients at risk of severe dengue disease in 2009. However, WS is limited in stratifying adult dengue patients at early infection (Day 1-3 post fever), who require close monitoring in hospitals to prevent severe dengue. The aim of this study is to identify and validate prognostic models, built with differentially expressed biomarkers, that enable the early identification of those with early dengue infection that require close clinical monitoring. METHODS: RNA microarray and protein assays were performed to identify differentially expressed biomarkers of severity among 92 adult dengue patients recruited at early infection from years 2005-2008. This comprised 47 cases who developed WS after first presentation and required hospitalization (WS+Hosp), as well as 45 controls who did not develop WS after first presentation and did not require hospitalization (Non-WS+Non-Hosp). Independent validation was conducted with 80 adult dengue patients recruited from years 2009-2012. Prognostic models were developed based on forward stepwise and backward elimination estimation, using multiple logistic regressions. Prognostic power was estimated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: The WS+Hosp group had significantly higher viral load (P<0.001), lower platelet (P<0.001) and lymphocytes counts (P = 0.004) at early infection compared to the Non-WS+Non-Hosp group. From the RNA microarray and protein assays, the top single RNA and protein prognostic models at early infection were CCL8 RNA (AUC:0.73) and IP-10 protein (AUC:0.74), respectively. The model with CCL8, VPS13C RNA, uPAR protein, and with CCL8, VPS13C RNA and platelets were the best biomarker models for stratifying adult dengue patients at early infection, with sensitivity and specificity up to 83% and 84%, respectively. These results were tested in the independent validation group, showing sensitivity and specificity up to 96% and 54.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: At early infection, adult dengue patients who later presented WS and require hospitalization have significantly different pathophysiology compared with patients who consistently presented no WS and / or require no hospitalization. The molecular prognostic models developed and validated here based on these pathophysiology differences, could offer earlier and complementary indicators to the clinical WHO 2009 WS guide, in order to triage adult dengue patients at early infection.","['Pang, Junxiong', 'Lindblom, Anna', 'Tolfvenstam, Thomas', 'Thein, Tun-Linn', 'Naim, Ahmad Nazri Mohamed', 'Ling, Ling', 'Chow, Angelia', 'Chen, Mark I-Cheng', 'Ooi, Eng Eong', 'Leo, Yee Sin', 'Hibberd, Martin L']","['Pang J', 'Lindblom A', 'Tolfvenstam T', 'Thein TL', 'Naim AN', 'Ling L', 'Chow A', 'Chen MI', 'Ooi EE', 'Leo YS', 'Hibberd ML']",,"['Infectious Disease, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Communicable Diseases Center, Institute of Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Infectious Disease, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine Solna, Unit of Infectious Diseases, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Infectious Disease, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine Solna, Unit of Infectious Diseases, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Unit for Highly Pathogenic Viruses, Public Health Agency of Sweden, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Communicable Diseases Center, Institute of Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Infectious Disease, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Infectious Disease, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Program in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Communicable Diseases Center, Institute of Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Program in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'DSO National Laboratories, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Communicable Diseases Center, Institute of Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Infectious Disease, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",20160610,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/*analysis/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Dengue/classification/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Triage/*methods', 'Young Adult']",PMC4902184,2016/06/11 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/06/11 06:00'],"['2015/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-15-19461 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0155993 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jun 10;11(6):e0155993. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0155993. eCollection 2016.,6,,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A pre- tested, structured questionnaire was used for data collection. The multistage cluster sampling method was employed and 640 households (HHs) were surveyed.

No control measures were followed to avoid mosquito breeding in the water holding containers by majority of HHs (65%). Sixty percent of HHs did not know the biting behaviour of dengue vector mosquitoes. The survey results indicate that the community knowledge was very poor on dengue, its transmission, vector breeding sources, biting behavior and preventive measures. The lack of basic knowledge of the community on dengue epidemiology and vector bionomics would be also a major cause of increasing trend of dengue in this highly populated urban environment.

It is produced by the dengue virus with four serotypes and transmitted by Aedes aegypti, a vector that coexists with humans and whose presence is favored by deficient sanitary, social and economic conditions. Manifestations of severe forms of the disease such as shock and bleeding, are related to the frequent co-circulation of the four serotypes and the emergence of new genotypes such as American/Asian serotype 2. The new classification of the disease by WHO as dengue with or without warning signs and severe dengue, is contributing to more timely diagnosis and treatment, enabling reductions in mortality. Of note is the need to highlight the surveillance of acute febrile illness and Aedes indices that contribute to a timely diagnosis and guide vector control measures through sanitary education and environmental management with community and intersectoral participation, in a creative manner according to ecological niches.

Because of the social and economic costs of DHF, many countries in Asia and South America have initiated public health measures aimed at vector control. Despite these measures, DHF incidence rates do not appear to be declining. The effectiveness of vector control in reducing dengue transmissibility has thereby been questioned. Here, we revisit this conclusion using epidemiological data from Thailand. We first show, with age incidence data, that dengue transmission rates have fallen since 1981; surprisingly, however, these declines are not associated with decreases in DHF incidence. Instead, district-level analyses indicate a nonmonotonic relationship between the basic reproductive number R0 and DHF incidence. To understand this relationship, we formulated three mathematical models, which differ in their assumptions of transient between-serotype cross-protection. Unlike the first two models, the previously unconsidered third model with clinical cross-protection can reproduce this nonmonotonic relationship. Simulation of this model with nonstationary R0 reproduces several previously unexplained patterns of dengue dynamics, including a transition from a approximately 2-year cycle to a approximately 4-year cycle and a transient trough in DHF incidence in provinces with rapid R0 declines. These results imply that DHF incidence can be effectively controlled with a sufficiently large reduction in R0 but that moderate reductions may be counterproductive. More broadly, these results show that assuming parameter stationarity in systems with approximate stationarity in disease incidence is unjustified and may result in missed opportunities to understand the drivers of disease variability.","['Nagao, Yoshiro', 'Koelle, Katia']","['Nagao Y', 'Koelle K']",,"['Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamadaoka Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080204,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Dengue/epidemiology/immunology/*transmission', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Species Specificity']",PMC2538904,2008/02/06 09:00,2008/04/01 09:00,['2008/02/06 09:00'],"['2008/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['0709029105 [pii]', '9252 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0709029105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 12;105(6):2238-43. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0709029105.

An investigation, with epidemiological, entomological and public health inputs, was initiated. Its objectives were to confirm the outbreak, to describe the emergence of dengue fever in the High Maroni area and to initiate a specific public health response. METHODS: The investigation was conducted in Maripasoula in February 2006, the biggest community in that part of the country. Definition criteria were used for suspected, probable and confirmed cases of dengue fever. An entomological evaluation for larvae and adult mosquitoes was carried out. Some personal and collective vector control measures were set up by the vector control team. RESULTS: This survey identified 127 suspected dengue fever cases, whereas the epidemiological surveillance system detected only six probable and confirmed cases from the same place and for the same period.

A total of 223 healthy subjects and 207 hospitalized dengue patients were prospectively studied. The dengue risk severity criteria was determined and grouped based on three blood investigations, namely, platelet (PLT) count (less than or equal to 30,000 cells per mm(3)), hematocrit (HCT) (increase by more than or equal to 20%), and either aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level (raised by fivefold the normal upper limit) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level (raised by fivefold the normal upper limit). The dengue patients were classified according to their risk groups and the corresponding BIA parameters were subsequently obtained and quantified. Four parameters were used for training and testing the ANN which are day of fever, reactance, gender, and risk group's quantification. Day of fever was defined as the day of fever subsided, i.e., when the body temperature fell below 37.5 degrees C. The blood investigation and the BIA data were taken for 5 days. The ANN was trained via the steepest descent back propagation with momentum algorithm using the log-sigmoid transfer function while the sum-squared error was used as the network's performance indicator. The best ANN architecture of 3-6-1 (3 inputs, 6 neurons in the hidden layer, and 1 output), learning rate of 0.1, momentum constant of 0.2, and iteration rate of 20,000 was pruned using a weight-eliminating method. Eliminating a weight of 0.05 enhances the dengue's prediction risk classification accuracy of 95.88% for high risk and 96.83% for low risk groups. As a result, the system is able to classify and diagnose the risk in the dengue patients with an overall prediction accuracy of 96.27%.","['Ibrahim, F', 'Faisal, T', 'Salim, M I Mohamad', 'Taib, M N']","['Ibrahim F', 'Faisal T', 'Salim MI', 'Taib MN']",,"['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Malaya, 50603, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. fatimah@um.edu.my']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100804,United States,Med Biol Eng Comput,Medical & biological engineering & computing,7704869,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Dengue/*diagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Early Diagnosis', '*Electric Impedance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Neural Networks, Computer', 'Risk Assessment']",,2010/08/05 06:00,2011/07/19 06:00,['2010/08/05 06:00'],"['2009/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11517-010-0669-z [doi]'],ppublish,Med Biol Eng Comput. 2010 Nov;48(11):1141-8. doi: 10.1007/s11517-010-0669-z.

Recently, the advancement in the microarray technology can be employed for such classification process. Several studies have established that the gene selection phase takes a significant role in the classifier performance. Subsequently, the current study focused on detecting two different variations, namely, dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). A modified bag-of-features method has been proposed to select the most promising genes in the classification process. Afterward, a modified cuckoo search optimization algorithm has been engaged to support the artificial neural (ANN-MCS) to classify the unknown subjects into three different classes namely, DF, DHF, and another class containing convalescent and normal cases. The proposed method has been compared with other three well-known classifiers, namely, multilayer perceptron feed-forward network (MLP-FFN), artificial neural network (ANN) trained with cuckoo search (ANN-CS), and ANN trained with PSO (ANN-PSO). Experiments have been carried out with different number of clusters for the initial bag-of-features-based feature selection phase. After obtaining the reduced dataset, the hybrid ANN-MCS model has been employed for the classification process. The results have been compared in terms of the confusion matrix-based performance measuring metrics. The experimental results indicated a highly statistically significant improvement with the proposed classifier over the traditional ANN-CS model.","['Chatterjee, Sankhadeep', 'Dey, Nilanjan', 'Shi, Fuqian', 'Ashour, Amira S', 'Fong, Simon James', 'Sen, Soumya']","['Chatterjee S', 'Dey N', 'Shi F', 'Ashour AS', 'Fong SJ', 'Sen S']",,"['Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India. chatterjeesankhadeep.cu@gmail.com.', 'Department of Information Technology, Techno India College of Technology, Kolkata, India.', ""College of Information and Engineering, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325035, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', ""Department of Computer and Information Science Data Analytics and Collaborative Computing Laboratory, University of Macau, Taipa, Zhuhai, Macau, People's Republic of China."", 'A.K.

Environmental factors and prevention].,442-9,,"An extensive dengue epidemic was reported in New Caledonia en 1989. Environmental factors (temperature and rainfalls) directly controlled the mosquitos population at the end of 1988. The introduction of a new dengue virus, transmitted by Aedes aegypti, was responsible for an epidemic that occurred in January-April 1989 and lasted until July 1989. The estimated number of cases was 25,000 and the attack rate was close to 120 per thousand inhabitants for a six month-period. The epidemic involved mainly the adult population in 84% of cases and 6-8% of patients was admitted in hospital with thrombopenia, leucopenia, minor haemorrhages in 2/3 of cases and 12 patients died with severe hemorrhagic disease or shock syndrome; initial serological results from suspected cases were positive against dengue by haemaglutination inhibition. Two dengue viruses were involved (dengue 1 and dengue 3) but dengue 3 was by far the most common. Ultra-low volume aerosols of diluted insecticide (decamethrine K'Othrine, Roussel) from road vehicles and aircraft was used from February to May to kill the adult mosquitoes (adulticiding). The efficacy dependent on the interaction of the insecticide and the flying mosquitoes is relative and debated but played probably a major role on the transmission, though the reduction of breeding sites was primarily uncovered. Since the epidemic, only sporadic cases were observed in 1991 and 1992.","['Laille, M', 'Huerre, M', 'Dubourdieu, H', 'Flye Sainte Marie, F']","['Laille M', 'Huerre M', 'Dubourdieu H', 'Flye Sainte Marie F']",,"['Institut Pasteur de Noumea, Nouvelle-Caledonie.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,France,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique (1990),9212564,,IM,"['Animals', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission', '*Environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Insect Vectors', 'Mosquito Control', 'New Caledonia/epidemiology']",,1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 1993;86(5 Pt 2):442-9.,5 Pt 2,,,,,,,,,Epidemie de dengue en Nouvelle-Caledonie (1989).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: An epidemic of dengue fever occurred in Martinique, French department of the Caribbean, in 2001-2002. This work was a clinical and epidemiologic study of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever in 58 children. RESULTS: Three children (5%) developed a hemorrhagic dengue, and 13 subjects (24%) presented at least with one hemorrhagic sign. Symptoms were polymorphous, certain forms were only myalgic; the main reason for consultation was the fever (89%). The principal characteristics were a leucopenia (56%) associated with a neutropenia (80%), a thrombocytopenia (54%), a hepatic cytolysis (66%) and sometimes a muscular cytolysis (9/15) and a increase in the ferritinemia (16/27). No death was noted. CONCLUSION: The treatment of the dengue is above all preventive, it consists in the antivector fight.","['Monnin, M', ""M'bou, F""]","['Monnin M', ""M'bou F""]",,"['Service de pediatrie, centre hospitalier de Lamentin, 97232 Lamentin, Martinique.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,France,Arch Pediatr,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,9421356,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/complications/*epidemiology/*pathology', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Martinique', 'Pediatrics/statistics & numerical data', 'Prognosis']",,2005/02/08 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2005/02/08 09:00'],"['2004/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0929-693X(04)00606-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.arcped.2004.11.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pediatr. 2005 Feb;12(2):144-50. doi: 10.1016/j.arcped.2004.11.006.,2,,,,,,,,,Une epidemie de dengue dans un service de pediatrie.

The type of dengue that carries the highest mortality is the clinical variant known as dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Even though no vaccine or drug against the disease is available, successful management consists of preventing serious illness through patient follow-up and monitoring danger signals so as to be able to initiate aggressive intravenous rehydration and prevent shock or treat it early and successfully. These measures are also useful in preventing other complications, such as massive hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, multiple organ failure, and respiratory failure due to non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Primary health care (PHC) settings and the community are ideal spaces for this type of preventive management based on health education and active case detection. It involves training all medical and nursing staff, students, and community health workers, as well as reorganizing health care in PHC units and hospitals and redistributing available resources during a dengue epidemic.","['Martinez Torres, Eric']",['Martinez Torres E'],,"['Subdierccion de Docencia de Postgrado.

This virus has 4 different serotypes and is responsible for approximately 50 to 100 million cases per year. Its incidence and geographic distribution are clearly increasing lately. Although occurring in tropical endemic areas, sporadic and autochthonous cases have been recently reported in temperate countries including France. The tropical influenza-like clinical presentation is not very specific except for rash. Diagnosis is facilitated by the existence of thrombocytopenia and the early detection of NS1 antigen using rapid test. Hemorragic forms with or without shock syndrome are rare in travelers and represent the severe manifestations especially in children. Their pathophysiology remains controversial. Management is essentially symptomatic. Aspirine should be avoided because of bleeding risk. Beyond individual (travel) or collective (endemic zone) vector control measures, the development of a quadrivalent vaccine seems about to succeed.","['Mechai, Frederic', 'Bouchaud, Olivier']","['Mechai F', 'Bouchaud O']",,"['Service des maladies infectieuses et tropicales, CHU Avicenne, AP-HP, universite Paris-13, 93009 Bobigny Cedex.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,France,Rev Prat,La Revue du praticien,0404334,,IM,"['*Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy/transmission/virology', 'Humans', '*Travel']",,2011/08/11 06:00,2011/09/02 06:00,['2011/08/11 06:00'],"['2011/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Prat. 2011 Jun;61(6):755-9.,6,,,,,,,,,La dengue: une infection emergente chez le voyageur.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For pathogens that consist of multiple antigenic types or strains, such as influenza, malaria or dengue, these fluctuations often take on the form of regular or irregular epidemic outbreaks in addition to oscillatory prevalence levels of the constituent strains. To explain the observed temporal dynamics and structuring in pathogen populations, epidemiological multi-strain models have commonly evoked strong immune interactions between strains as the predominant driver. Here, with specific reference to dengue, we show how spatially explicit, multi-strain systems can exhibit all of the described epidemiological dynamics even in the absence of immune competition. Instead, amplification of natural stochastic differences in disease transmission, can give rise to persistent oscillations comprising semi-regular epidemic outbreaks and sequential dominance of dengue's four serotypes. Not only can this mechanism explain observed differences in serotype and disease distributions between neighbouring geographical areas, it also has important implications for inferring the nature and epidemiological consequences of immune mediated competition in multi-strain pathogen systems.","['Lourenco, Jose', 'Recker, Mario']","['Lourenco J', 'Recker M']",,"['Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131024,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,,IM,"['*Communicable Diseases', '*Dengue', '*Epidemics', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological']",PMC3812071,2013/11/10 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2013/11/09 06:00'],"['2013/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['PCOMPBIOL-D-13-00579 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2013 Oct;9(10):e1003308. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.

OBJECTIVES: Dengue fever was diagnosed at the Department of Infectious Disease, University Hospital in Brno, so the authors decided to make local physicians aware of the possibility of the disease being contracted by Czech travelers. METHODS: The first two cases of dengue fever, with the patients hospitalized at the Department of Infectious Disease, University Hospital in Brno, Czech Republic, are described. RESULTS: A young couple contracted this infection in a region usually visited by tourists in Thailand. The disease broke out 12 hours after their return home. The clinical and laboratory pictures of the disease and the kinetics of serological responses are described in detail. CONCLUSION: The chief diagnostic clue with this disease, beside a visit to a high-risk area, can be considered a sudden onset of fever accompanied by marked fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia. Laboratory tests showed characteristic thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pathological values of AST and ALT. The clinical picture is characterized by symptoms of persisting fatigue and exhaustion, even after the fever has subsided.","['Chalupa, P', 'Kubek, J', 'Hejlova, A']","['Chalupa P', 'Kubek J', 'Hejlova A']",,"['Clinic of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital, Jihlavska 20, CZ-639 00 Brno, Czech Republic. pchalupa@fnbrno.cz']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Slovakia,Bratisl Lek Listy,Bratislavske lekarske listy,0065324,,IM,"['Adult', 'Czech Republic/epidemiology', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Thailand', 'Travel']",,2001/12/01 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/01 10:00'],"['2001/12/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/01 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bratisl Lek Listy. 2001;102(7):322-5.,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly lymphadenopathy, especially cervical (30.89%), palatal rashes (26.96%) and hepatomegaly (23.75%) were the most commonly encountered findings on physical examination. Most of the cases were of dengue fever with haemorrhage and only 2.5% cases were classified under dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. The average hospital stay was 3.4 days but only 9.8 hours in the eleven patients who died, suggesting their late arrival in preterminal situation giving little time for resuscitation. Thrombocytopenia was not a feature and only 12.85% patients had platelet count less than 70,000/cmm. Most of the patients who were admitted with thrombocytopenia, showed normalization in their platelet counts in next few days. Serological examination demonstrated evidence of recent dengue infection in 41.17% patients. Few patients required blood or platelet concentrate transfusion. Eleven patients died, three due to DIC, one of intracranial haemorrhage and seven due to massive gastric haemorrhage. Rest of the patients recovered completely.

Classical dengue fever (DF) was noted in 11% patients and 89% children presented with dengue hemorrhagic fever / dengue shock syndrome (DHF / DSS). Common clinical presentations were fever, headache, retro- orbital pain, arthralgia / bone pain, vomiting, abdominal pain and bleeding manifestations. Other presentations were tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, pleural effusion, ascites, thrombocytopenia and high hematocrit values. The incidences of tachycardia, hypotension, hepatomegaly, high hematocrit and thrombocytopenia were significantly higher in DHF / DSS cases. The tourniquet test was positive in significantly higher percentage of DF cases. The tourniquet test and thrombocytopenia did not correlate well with other bleeding manifestations suggesting alternate pathogenesis for bleeding. In an epidemic setting, if a child presents with fever, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain and bleeding along with hepatomegaly, low platelet count and high hematocrit, a strong possibility of DHF/ DSS should be kept.","['Shah, G S', 'Islam, S', 'Das, B K']","['Shah GS', 'Islam S', 'Das BK']",,"['Department of Paediatrics, B P Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Nepal. gaurisshah@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Nepal,Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),Kathmandu University medical journal (KUMJ),101215359,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Nepal/epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies']",,2008/07/08 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ). 2006 Jan-Mar;4(1):40-3.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A factorial analysis was performed by means of a set of indicators contributing to variability. The indicator scores were added and the cities demanding for prior attention of the NPCD were classified for the construction of an index, which is presented three-monthly for every state, with intervals distributed between 0 and 9. The implantation of the NCPD is irregular. Cities with bad implantation are predominating in the north and northeast of the country. In the second analysis, socio-economic variables of the selected cities were added. For the association tests these cities were classified into two groups: 'Bad' and 'Good/Very Good', based on the association of the index of building infestation informed in the FAD (Yellow Fever and Dengue) database and the constructed index. Associations were verified based on variance analysis, trend test and trend estimate.

METHODS: Seroprevalence data were abstracted from surveys performed in Singapore from 1982 to 2002. These data were used to develop two mathematical models of age seroprevalence. In the first model, force of infection was allowed to vary independently each year, while in the second it was described by a polynomial function. Model-predicted temporal trends were analysed using linear regression. Time series techniques were employed to investigate periodicity in predicted forces of infection, dengue fever incidence and mosquito breeding. FINDINGS: Force of infection estimates showed a significant downward trend from 1966, when vector control was instigated. Force of infection estimates from both models reproduced significant increases in the percentage and average age of the population susceptible to dengue infections. Importantly, the year-on-year model independently predicted a five to six year periodicity that was also displayed by clinical incidence but absent from the Aedes household index. CONCLUSION: We propose that the rise in disease incidence was due in part to a vector-control-driven reduction in herd immunity in older age groups that are more susceptible to developing clinical dengue.","['Egger, Joseph R', 'Ooi, Eng Eong', 'Kelly, David W', 'Woolhouse, Mark E', 'Davies, Clive R', 'Coleman, Paul G']","['Egger JR', 'Ooi EE', 'Kelly DW', 'Woolhouse ME', 'Davies CR', 'Coleman PG']",,"['Disease Control and Vector Biology Unit, Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, England.

RESULTS: Dengue transmission was registered in 17% of the localities in the State; 70% of the cases were concentrated in only 6% of the localities. Recurrent localities were urban centers with adequate availability of public services and low deprivation indices. Dengue transmission was detected in rural areas, but it was not common. The average number of cases differed according to the size of the locality and the number of years dengue was reported. A population threshold to maintain transmission was found.

Dengue virus belongs to the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. There are four dengue virus serotypes (1-4) which are maintained endemically. The disease is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas between latitudes 35 degrees N and 35 degrees S. Infections may be asymptomatic or may produce a wide spectrum of diseases: non-specific febrile illness, dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. For the first time in Croatia, Ae. albopictus was registered in Zagreb in October 2004. In autumn 2005, additional records of Ae. albopictus presence were made in many places along the Adriatic coast. During 2007, two cases of imported dengue fever were reported in Croatia, after which similar imported cases appeared continually. In August 2010, the first autochthonous case of dengue fever was recorded on the peninsula Peljesac. Though Croatia is not endemic for dengue, the existence of a corresponding vector and a latent threat by imported dengue cases demand state-of-the-art and timely diagnostics. The most commonly used methods in laboratory diagnosis of dengue infections involve detection of viral RNA, antigen detection and serologic methods (detection of antibodies).","['Vilibic-Cavlek, Tatjana', 'Ljubin-Sternak, Suncanica', 'Babic-Erceg, Andrea', 'Sviben, Mario', 'Mlinaric-Galinovic, Gordana']","['Vilibic-Cavlek T', 'Ljubin-Sternak S', 'Babic-Erceg A', 'Sviben M', 'Mlinaric-Galinovic G']",,"['Odjel za virologiju, Hrvatski zavod za javno zdravstvo, Medicinski fakultet Sveucilisa u Zagrebu. tatjana.vilibic-cavlek@hzjz.hr']",['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Croatia,Lijec Vjesn,Lijecnicki vjesnik,0074253,,IM,"['Aedes', 'Animals', 'Croatia/epidemiology', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/epidemiology/transmission', 'Dengue Virus/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Insect Vectors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2012/08/31 06:00,2012/10/17 06:00,['2012/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Lijec Vjesn. 2012 May-Jun;134(5-6):164-7.,5-6,,,,,,,,,Viroloska dijagnostika reemergentnih infekcija: virus dengue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent outbreak in West Bengal has once again underlined our failure in vector control and prevention. Our study outlines the clinical spectrum as well as the geographical expansion of the disease beyond urban confines. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients with acute febrile illness positive for IgM antibody for Dengue virus were taken as cases. The patients were subjected to clinical examination and baseline investigations so as to fill in a structured proforma. RESULT: The total number of patients were 180 of whom 92 (51.1%) were male and 88 (48.9%) were female. The maximum number of patients belonged to the age group 20-29 years (26.9%). The patients mostly hailed from Kolkata followed by Nadia, 24- Parganas(S), Murshidabad and Midnapur. The most common presentation apart from fever and bodyache were gastrointestinal symptoms. 42% patients complained of abdominal pain, 24% had vomiting, 9.6% diarrhoea. Bleeding manifestations occurred in 23% of patients. CNS features were documented 10.4%. Case fatality came out to be 3.8%. Investigations revealed thrombocytopenia in 55% and leucopenia 32.7%, transaminitis in 72% Evidence of organomegaly (22.2%) and serositis (42%) were detected. Complications included intracranial haemorrhage, DIC, pancreatitis, myocarditis and even a solitary case of splenic rupture. CONCLUSION: The current outbreak was affecting both the genders equitably and mostly the younger age group from rural as well as urban areas. A febrile illness characterised by myalgia, mild bleeding and gastrointestinal symptoms, it was more or less promptly responsive to early conservative therapy like fluids, FFP and platelet transfusion where required.","['Chatterjee, Nandini', 'Mukhopadhyay, Mainak', 'Ghosh, Sinjon', 'Mondol, Manas', 'Das, Chiranjib', 'Patar, Kartik']","['Chatterjee N', 'Mukhopadhyay M', 'Ghosh S', 'Mondol M', 'Das C', 'Patar K']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Assoc Physicians India,The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,7505585,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Tertiary Healthcare', 'Young Adult']",,2014/10/21 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2014/10/21 06:00'],"['2014/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Physicians India. 2014 Mar;62(3):224-7.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effective prevention and control programs will depend on improved surveillance. A new approach to active surveillance is outlined with emphasis on the interepidemic period. The objective is to develop an early warning surveillance system than can predict epidemic dengue. Virologic surveillance is the most important in an early warning system. Dengue virus transmission should be monitored to provide information on which serotypes are present, their distribution, and the type of illness associated with each serotype. Other components of the active surveillance system include fever alert and clinical surveillance for severe and fatal disease associated with viral syndrome. Individually, each component is not very sensitive, but collectively, they provide an early warning capability that allows detection of newly introduced dengue virus serotypes well in advance of epidemic transmission. With such information, emergency mosquito control can be implemented and major epidemics averted.","['Gubler, D J']",['Gubler DJ'],,,['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Bol Oficina Sanit Panam,Boletin de la Oficina Sanitaria Panamericana.

This was the first dengue epidemic ever recorded in this region. Although dengue is a growing public health problem in Brazil, and DHF/DSS has been reported to be evolving in the Americas, health officials have shown a passive attitude towards the disease, partly due to lack of experience. Reporting dengue occurrences, both of isolated cases and of epidemics, is essential to reduce mortality. The data analyzed were collected through the official epidemiological surveillance system during the 1990-1991 epidemic. Out of 2,521 confirmed cases of dengue, 34 cases of febrile acute illness with hemorrhagic manifestations were identified as possible cases of DHF/DSS, as well as two deaths associated to dengue. From these 36 cases, 12 cases were confirmed by laboratory exams as dengue with hemorrhagic manifestations. Examinations of clinical and laboratory data, and results of the autopsies suggested that the two deaths were cases of primary DHF/DSS. The difficulty of the health system in establishing the clinical suspicion of DHF/DSS was confirmed in the study. This resulted in delayed and inadequate clinical procedure. The present study also confirmed the need for a permanent active epidemiological surveillance system for the early identification of DHF/DSS suspect cases thus enabling quick and adequate control actions.","['Pontes, R J', 'Ruffino-Netto, A']","['Pontes RJ', 'Ruffino-Netto A']",,"['Universidade Federal do Ceara, Departamento de Saude Comunitaria, Centro de Ciencias de Saude, Fortaleza, Cear, Brasil.']",['por'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Rev Panam Salud Publica,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,9705400,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/classification/*epidemiology/prevention & control', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Factors']",,1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S1020-49891997000300004 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Panam Salud Publica. 1997 Mar;1(3):186-92.,3,,,,,,,,,"Vigilancia e busca ativa de casos suspeitos de dengue hemorragico em Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To describe and to analyze the relevant clinical and pathological findings in fatal dengue cases of dengue in a Venezuelan endemic area. METHODS: Eight fatal cases, according to clinical and epidemiological dengue criteria and/or confirmed by complete serological tests were studied after complete clinical necropsy. The tissues were processed by standard histopathological techniques. RESULTS: All these cases showed severe lung disease (diffuse alveolar damage, non cardiogenic pulmonary edema, thromboembolism, bronchopneumonia, pneumonitis, intralveolar hemorrhage). Six presented with pleural or abdominal effusion. Focal hepatic necrosis was found in two cases. The cause of death was related to respiratory failure in six (6) cases secondary to lung disease; two with hypovolemic shock, and one developed liver failure. CONCLUSION: the studied dengue cases showed fatal severe pulmonary compromise leading to death, unlike those reported in other studies of autopsies in The Americas. They also developed multiple organ failure, which in most cases led to death not directly associated to hypovolemic shock. These findings in autopsies will allow designing therapeutic strategies to avoid mortality.","['Arismendi-Morillo, Gabriel', 'Mauriello-Rivas, Carla', 'Maldonado-Reverol, Maria', 'Fernandez-Abreu, Mary', 'Larreal, Marcos', 'Torres-Nava, V Gustavo', 'Romero-Amaro, Zoila']","['Arismendi-Morillo G', 'Mauriello-Rivas C', 'Maldonado-Reverol M', 'Fernandez-Abreu M', 'Larreal M', 'Torres-Nava VG', 'Romero-Amaro Z']",,"['Instituto de Investigaciones Biologicas-Laboratorio de Microscopia Electronica, Facultad de Medicina-Universidad del Zulia, Servicio de Anatomia Patologica, Hospital General del Sur ""Dr. Pedro Iturbe"", Maracaibo, Venezuela. gabrielarismendi@gmail.com']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Cuba,Rev Cubana Med Trop,Revista cubana de medicina tropical,0074364,,IM,"['Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/*mortality/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Venezuela/epidemiology']",,2011/01/01 00:00,2013/04/02 06:00,['2013/02/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Cubana Med Trop. 2011 Jan-Apr;63(1):44-51.,1,,,,,,,,,"Correlacion clinico-patologica en casos fatales de dengue en Maracaibo, Venezuela.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than one million inhabitants were sick and about 1500 died. The outbreak extended to the whole Greek territory and evolved in two epidemics waves. The first one occurred during the second half of 1927, was not very extensive and relatively benign. The second wave, explosive, started on July 1928, reached its summit in August and then declined until November. During this second part of the outbreak severe clinical events were identified, such as hemorrhagic, neurological or renal disorders, along with infections during pregnancy. The mosquito Aedes aegypti was the alone vector of the disease and dengue type 1 virus was the main etiological agent both in 1927 and 1928. The eventual activity of the dengue type 2 virus and its possible role in the pathogenesis of severe clinical forms of dengue, during 1928, remains unclear. Relatively speaking, it is possible to parallel this ""historical"" outbreak with the recent epidemic episode which appeared in 2007 in the Ravenne's area in northern Italy. This outbreak was caused by the Chikungunya virus after its importation from southern India by an infected traveller.

Based on an ethnographic premise, this study considered the unequal and unfair conditions that make women's health vulnerable to dengue, analyzing their practices and perceptions about the potential breeding grounds in the public space. A semi-structured interview and participant observation, as well as a field diary, were used to compose the study. The research included the participation of ten women living in the outskirts of Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil, from January to August 2014. The category ""Social inequality, context and practices in the public space"" emerged from the content analysis. The narratives revealed that unstable living conditions and evident social inequality might influence in a context permeated by waste, with great potential for dengue's mosquito proliferation.","['Oliveira, Krysne Kelly de Franca', 'Caprara, Andrea']","['Oliveira KKF', 'Caprara A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2154-5064', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1972-8205']","['Universidade Estadual do Ceara.

Space-time statistics facilitate the discovery of disease dynamics including rate of spread and seasonal cyclic patterns, but are computationally demanding, especially for datasets of increasing size, diversity and availability. High-performance computing reduces the effort required to identify these patterns, however heterogeneity in the data must be accounted for. We develop an adaptive space-time domain decomposition approach for parallel computation of the space-time kernel density. We apply our methodology to individual reported dengue cases from 2010 to 2011 in the city of Cali, Colombia. The parallel implementation reaches significant speedup compared to sequential counterparts. Density values are visualized in an interactive 3D environment, which facilitates the identification and communication of uneven space-time distribution of disease events.

Terms associated with the concept of dengue and conceptual dimension groups were investigated. RESULTS: Participants cultural conceptions regarding dengue in Mexico emphasised prevention, whilst those in Colombia concentrated on biomedical language and symptoms.

The epidemic model used in this work displays a Hopf bifurcation to oscillations in a single, well-mixed population. It is shown numerically that migration between two non-identical patches stabilizes the endemic steady state, delaying the onset of large amplitude outbreaks and reducing the total number of infections. This result is motivated by analyzing generic Hopf bifurcations with different frequencies and with diffusive coupling between them. Stabilization of the steady state is again seen, indicating that our observation in the full multistrain model is based on qualitative characteristics of the dynamics rather than on details of the disease model.","['Bianco, Simone', 'Shaw, Leah B']","['Bianco S', 'Shaw LB']",,"['Department of Applied Science, The College of William and Mary, P.O.

The accuracy of the 1997 World Health Organization (WHO) dengue case definition has been debated for a decade, because the definition was very stringent, for instance, several researchers showed that apparently severe cases were misclassified as not severe. Therefore the WHO issued revised guidelines in 2009. Here, we retrospectively compared the performance of the WHO case definition of 2009 with the WHO case definition of 1997 in a detailed documented pediatric cohort from Indonesia. Intensive treatment intervention was used as an indicator of severity of disease. In line with our expectations, the 2009 WHO case classification proved to be significantly more specific, albeit less sensitive than the WHO case classification of 1997. We conclude that the revised classification is promising both from research and clinical perspectives, but validation of the classification criteria still needs to be addressed.","['van de Weg, Cornelia A M', 'van Gorp, Eric C M', 'Supriatna, Mohamad', 'Soemantri, Augustinus', 'Osterhaus, Albert D M E', 'Martina, Byron E E']","['van de Weg CA', 'van Gorp EC', 'Supriatna M', 'Soemantri A', 'Osterhaus AD', 'Martina BE']",,"['Department of Virology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. c.vandeweg@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Trop Med Hyg,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,0370507,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dengue/*classification/diagnosis/physiopathology/virology', 'Dengue Virus', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indonesia', 'Male', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of Illness Index', '*World Health Organization']",PMC3247126,2012/01/11 06:00,2012/03/10 06:00,['2012/01/11 06:00'],"['2012/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['86/1/166 [pii]', '10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0491 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2012 Jan;86(1):166-70. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0491.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS: A household survey was conducted in 2013 among 3,350 households. The households were stratified by a number of variables related to socio-economic status and health events such as hospitalisation. The data collection was completed through face-to-face interviews conducted with the help of 25 field investigators. RESULTS: About 8% of the households had at least one diagnosed dengue case. In comparison to the population surveyed, teenagers (15-19 years) and adults (30-34 years) were more affected whereas children under four years of age were underrepresented. Housewives are more affected by dengue (24%) compared to their share of the population surveyed (17%). Despite the fact that 77% of the respondents are worried about mosquitoes, only 43% of them monitor environment to avoid the presence of breeding sites. CONCLUSION: One cannot exclude the possibility that though young children under the age of four years are exposed to the virus, either their cases were asymptomatic or family members infected during this period had potentially more serious symptoms leading to hospitalisation. This result could thus be explained by budget-related health choices made by this population which do not favour small children. Educational programs should target housewives to improve their impact, as they are the ones mostly responsible for water storage and cleanliness of the house and its neighbourhood. Even with a dengue experience and potentially an acute perception of the risk and its factors, a proper management of environmental conditions is lacking. This along with the fact that word-of-mouth is the main source of information quoted should be a message for municipality health workers to give door-to-door information on how to prevent breeding sites and dengue infection.","['Daude, Eric', 'Mazumdar, Sumit', 'Solanki, Vandana']","['Daude E', 'Mazumdar S', 'Solanki V']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8656-3346'],"['The National Center for Scientific Research, Center for Social Sciences and Humanities, Delhi, India.', 'Institute of Public Health, Kalyani, West Bengal, India.', 'The National Center for Scientific Research, Center for Social Sciences and Humanities, Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170210,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cities', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/prevention & control/psychology/transmission', 'Fear', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'India', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mosquito Control/*statistics & numerical data', 'Poverty Areas', 'Primary Prevention/statistics & numerical data']",PMC5302449,2017/02/12 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2017/02/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-16-19074 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0171543 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Feb 10;12(2):e0171543. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0171543. eCollection 2017.,2,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to report the frequency of dengue as a cause of fever in Binh Thuan Province, to describe the characteristics of dengue patients, and analyze the diagnostic accuracy of the health care workers and the determinants of the diagnostic process. METHODS: All patients presenting with acute undifferentiated fever at twelve community health posts and one clinic at the provincial malaria station, Binh Thuan Province, a dengue endemic province in southern Vietnam, were included. Record forms were used to fill in patient and diseases characteristics, pre-referral treatment, signs and symptoms, provisional diagnosis and prescribed treatment, referral and final outcome. Serum samples were collected at first presentation and after 3 weeks for serologic diagnosis. RESULTS: 2096 patients were included from April 2001 to March 2002. All 697 patients with paired serum samples were tested for dengue virus IgM and IgG. Acute dengue was found in 33.6% cases and past dengue virus infections were found in 57.1% cases. Acute primary infections were more common among children under 15 years old than among adults (7.7% vs. 3.5%, p value < 0.001). Younger age significantly predicted acute dengue (RR per increasing year of age (95 % CI): 0.986 (0.975-0.997, p value = 0.014). 48.9% of cases with clinical diagnosis of acute dengue were serologically confirmed and 32.5% of cases without clinical diagnosis of acute dengue were positive by serology after all (OR = 1.981, p value 0.025, 95% CI: 1.079-3.635). Tourniquet test was not a predictor for dengue diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Dengue is responsible for one third of the fevers presented to the public primary health services in Binh Thuan, southern Vietnam. It presents as a highly unspecific illness and is hardly recognized as a clinical entity by primary physicians.","['Phuong, Hoang Lan', 'de Vries, Peter J', 'Nga, Tran T T', 'Giao, Phan T', 'Hung, Le Q', 'Binh, Tran Q', 'Nam, Nguyen V', 'Nagelkerke, Nico', 'Kager, Piet A']","['Phuong HL', 'de Vries PJ', 'Nga TT', 'Giao PT', 'Hung le Q', 'Binh TQ', 'Nam NV', 'Nagelkerke N', 'Kager PA']",,"['Division of Infectious Diseases, Tropical Medicine and AIDS, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. lanphuongh@hcm.vnn.vn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20060725,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/*complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Endemic Diseases', 'Female', 'Fever/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vietnam/epidemiology']",PMC1579223,2006/07/28 09:00,2006/10/18 09:00,['2006/07/28 09:00'],"['2006/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2334-6-123 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2334-6-123 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2006 Jul 25;6:123. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-6-123.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a major public health problem, especially in tropical and sub-tropical areas worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 40% of the world's population (over 2.5 billion people) live in areas with high risk of contracting dengue infection. Adults of childbearing age and pregnant women are travelling more frequently to tropical areas. Therefore exposing themselves to specific arboviral infections such as dengue, which may impact ongoing and future pregnancies. Clinical manifestations of dengue are wide ranging from asymptomatic to needing intensive care in cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever. The effects of dengue during and on pregnancy are unclear, moreover there is a lack of a cohesive reference to inform women of reproductive age who live in or travel to endemic areas and are at risk of contracting dengue. Here we present review of literature specifically looking at etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, management of dengue in pregnancy as well as its effect on maternal health and fetal outcomes. There is clear evidence to suggest adverse maternal outcomes in women with symptomatic dengue in low resource countries. A high index of clinical suspicion and early referral to tertiary center will prevent maternal -fetal serious adverse events in endemic areas. This review will help Clinicians in advising as well as managing women who travel during pregnancy to endemic areas as well as clinicians based in endemic areas who are managing women with dengue in pregnancy.","['Mulik, Varsha', 'Dad, Nimra', 'Buhmaid, Sara']","['Mulik V', 'Dad N', 'Buhmaid S']",,"['Sidra Medicine, Education City, Al Luqta Street, Doha, Qatar.

Disease burden estimates help decision makers in setting priorities. Using recent estimates of dengue incidence in Cambodia, we estimated the cost of dengue and its burden using disability adjusted life years (DALYs). METHODS: Recent population-based cohort data were used to calculate direct and productive costs, and DALYs. Health seeking behaviors were taken into account in cost estimates. Specific age group incidence estimates were used in DALYs calculation. RESULTS: The mean cost per dengue case varied from US$36 - $75 over 2006-2008 respectively, resulting in an overall annual cost from US$3,327,284 in 2008 to US$14,429,513 during a large epidemic in 2007. Patients sustain the highest share of costs by paying an average of 78% of total costs and 63% of direct medical costs. DALY rates per 100,000 individuals ranged from 24.3 to 100.6 in 2007-2008 with 80% on average due to premature mortality. CONCLUSION: Our analysis confirmed the high societal and individual family burden of dengue. Total costs represented between 0.03 and 0.17% of Gross Domestic Product. Health seeking behavior has a major impact on costs. The more accurate estimate used in this study will better allow decision makers to account for dengue costs particularly among the poor when balancing the benefits of introducing a potentially effective dengue vaccine.","['Beaute, Julien', 'Vong, Sirenda']","['Beaute J', 'Vong S']",,"['Epidemiology and Public Health Unit, Institut Pasteur in Cambodia, Bd Monivong 5, BP 983 Phnom Penh, Cambodia. julbeaute@yahoo.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100831,England,BMC Public Health,BMC public health,100968562,,IM,"['Cambodia/epidemiology', '*Cost of Illness', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Dengue/*economics/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Health Policy', 'Humans', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years']",PMC2941493,2010/09/03 06:00,2011/01/11 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2458-10-521 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2458-10-521 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Public Health. 2010 Aug 31;10:521. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-10-521.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DHF is characterized by fever, bleeding diathesis and a tendency to develop a potentially fatal shock syndrome. Hematological findings include vasculopathy, coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia as the most constant findings.

The two types of cutaneous signs observed during the fever are described and their physiopathology is discussed.","['Caumes, E', 'Santi, C', 'Felix, H', 'Bricaire, F', 'Danis, M', 'Gentilini, M']","['Caumes E', 'Santi C', 'Felix H', 'Bricaire F', 'Danis M', 'Gentilini M']",,"['Departement de Maladies Infectieuses, Parasitologie-Mycologie et Sante Publique, Hopital de la Salpetriere, Paris.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,France,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique (1990),9212564,,IM,"['Adult', 'Asia', 'Dengue/complications/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Skin Diseases/*microbiology']",,1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 1993;86(1):7-11.,1,,,,,,,,,Signes cutanes de la dengue.

This classification provides two forms of dengue fever (DF): dengue fever (A90) and hemorrhagic dengue (A91). Official statistics on the ratio of forms of DF is not published in open sources and this lack of information about the real ratio of the forms of DF makes it difficult to objectively assess the factors that determine the severity of this disease. THE AIM: compare the clinical and epidemiological features of dengue fever and hemorrhagic dengue fever in patients hospitalized in 2009-2019 to the City Infectious Clinical Hospital No. 1, Moscow. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study. We analyzed the patient database and reviewed 391 medical records of patients with diagnosed dengue fever. We compared gender, age characteristics, travel geography including information about previous visits of patients to endemic regions and dengue virus serotype. To determine the primary and re-infection rate, an analysis of IgG for the dengue virus was carried out on days 1-5 of the disease. To compare indicators, 95% confidence intervals for proportions, medians, and interquartile ranges were calculated. The significance of differences between independent samples for assessing qualitative characteristics was carried out using the criteria chi2, the odds ratio. To assess the quantitative characteristics, the Mann-Whitney test was used. Differences were considered statistically significant at p </= 0.05. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with dengue fever was 14.9% of all hospitalized with febrile illnesses that developed after international travel. Hemorrhagic dengue fever (DHF) was diagnosed in 15.7% of patients with dengue fever. DHF developed significantly more often in women, as well as in those who had history of repeated visits to endemic regions. However, DHF was also diagnosed in 10.9% of first-time travelers to tropical countries. We did not find significant differences in the rates of DHF development depending on age and dengue virus serotype. In a number of patients who had not previously traveled to endemic regions, IgG to the dengue virus were detected, which may indicate a previous infection with related flaviviruses. CONCLUSION: It has been established that in the regions most visited by Russians, there is a circulation of all serotypes of the dengue virus with an annual change in the predominant serotype.","['Sayfullin, M A', 'Zvereva, N N', 'Karan, L S', 'Grigoreva, Ya E', 'Akinshina, Yu A', 'Larichev, V F', 'Shamsheva, O V', 'Bazarova, M V', 'Smetanina, S V']","['Sayfullin MA', 'Zvereva NN', 'Karan LS', 'Grigoreva YE', 'Akinshina YA', 'Larichev VF', 'Shamsheva OV', 'Bazarova MV', 'Smetanina SV']",,"['Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University; Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology named after the honorary academician N.F.

Dengue encephalitis is a rare but fatal manifestation of severe dengue. Diagnosis requires high clinical suspicion. It should be routinely considered in patients with encephalopathy, especially in countries where dengue virus is endemic. Unlike other forms of severe dengue, the typical warning signs and biochemical derangements are not reliable markers for dengue encephalitis. Alternative biochemical markers of dengue encephalitis are needed. CASE REPORT We present a case of dengue encephalitis with distinctly raised procalcitonin (13.2 mug/L), in the absence of the typical warning signs and biochemical derangements of severe dengue. The patient was a 65-year-old man with fever and sudden loss of consciousness in the absence of other localizing signs/symptoms. Inflammatory markers were raised, with findings of leptomeningeal enhancement on brain computed tomography suggestive of meningoencephalitis. Septic workup was unremarkable (normal renal and liver functions, negative blood and urine cultures). The typical neurotropic microorganisms were not detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. On day 4 of admission, the patient reported abdominal pain and hematuria with a new onset of bicytopenia. Subsequent investigations for dengue infection were positive for serum dengue NS1 antigen and dengue RNA (type 2 strain) in cerebrospinal fluid, confirming the diagnosis of dengue encephalitis. The patient was managed supportively and experienced full clinical recovery. CONCLUSIONS Dengue encephalitis is a rare condition with nonspecific biochemical and imaging abnormalities. We demonstrated that a raised procalcitonin level can occur in the setting of dengue encephalitis. In endemic countries, this finding may prompt further investigations for dengue encephalitis in patients with meningoencephalitis.","['Xu, Flora', 'Nadarajan, Krithikaa', 'Toh, Ming Ren']","['Xu F', 'Nadarajan K', 'Toh MR']",,"['Yong Loo Ling School of Medicine, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210517,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,['0 (Procalcitonin)'],IM,"['Aged', '*Dengue/complications/diagnosis', '*Encephalitis', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Procalcitonin']",PMC8141333,2021/05/18 06:00,2021/05/19 06:00,['2021/05/17 05:53'],"['2021/05/17 05:53 [entrez]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['931519 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.931519 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2021 May 17;22:e931519. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.931519.,,,,,['Conflict of interest: None declared Conflict of Interest None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When empirical methods are unavailable, complimentary opinion-based or extrapolative methods have been employed. Here, an expert Delphi panel estimated the proportion of dengue captured by the Indonesian surveillance system, and associated health system parameters. Following presentation of medical and epidemiological data and subsequent discussions, the panel made iterative estimates from which expansion factors (EF), the ratio of total:reported cases, were calculated. Panelists estimated that of all symptomatic Indonesian dengue episodes, 57.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 46.6-59.8) enter healthcare facilities to seek treatment; 39.3% (95% CI 32.8-42.0) are diagnosed as dengue; and 20.3% (95% CI 16.1-24.3) are subsequently reported in the surveillance system. They estimated most hospitalizations occur in the public sector, while ~55% of ambulatory episodes are seen privately. These estimates gave an overall EF of 5.00; hospitalized EF of 1.66; and ambulatory EF of 34.01 which, when combined with passive surveillance data, equates to an annual average (2006-2015) of 612 005 dengue cases, and 183 297 hospitalizations. These estimates are lower than those published elsewhere, perhaps due to case definitions, local clinical perceptions and treatment-seeking behavior. These findings complement global burden estimates, support health economic analyses, and can be used to inform decision-making.","['Wahyono, T Y M', 'Nealon, J', 'Beucher, S', 'Prayitno, A', 'Moureau, A', 'Nawawi, S', 'Thabrany, H', 'Nadjib, M']","['Wahyono TYM', 'Nealon J', 'Beucher S', 'Prayitno A', 'Moureau A', 'Nawawi S', 'Thabrany H', 'Nadjib M']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1538-4636'],"['Center for Health Economics and Policy Studies, Universitas Indonesia,Depok,Indonesia.', 'Sanofi Pasteur,Asia & JPAC Region,Singapore.', 'Sanofi Pasteur,Asia & JPAC Region,Singapore.', 'Department of Child Health,Faculty of Medicine,University of Indonesia,Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital,Jakarta,Indonesia.', ""Sanofi Pasteur,Marcy L'Etoile,France."", 'Sanofi Pasteur,Jakarta,Indonesia.', 'Center for Health Economics and Policy Studies, Universitas Indonesia,Depok,Indonesia.', 'Center for Health Economics and Policy Studies, Universitas Indonesia,Depok,Indonesia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170526,England,Epidemiol Infect,Epidemiology and infection,8703737,,IM,"['Delphi Technique', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/prevention & control/virology', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Indonesia/epidemiology', '*Population Surveillance']",PMC5647663,2017/05/27 06:00,2017/08/19 06:00,['2017/05/27 06:00'],"['2017/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0950268817001030 [pii]', '00103 [pii]', '10.1017/S0950268817001030 [doi]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Infect. 2017 Aug;145(11):2324-2329. doi: 10.1017/S0950268817001030.

The objective was to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of dengue fever in Czech travellers. METHOD: This descriptive study includes patients with acute dengue fever diagnosed at Hospital Na Bulovce during 2004-2013. Data were collected and analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients (83 males and 49 females) of median age 33 years (IQR 29-40) were included. Diagnosis was established by NS1 antigen detection in 87/107 cases (81.3%) and/or RT-PCR in 50/72 (69.4%) and by serology in 25 cases (18.9%). Dengue was acquired in South-East Asia in 69 cases (52.3%), followed by South Asia (48 cases; 36.3%), Latin America (14; 10.6%) and Sub-Saharan Africa (1; 0.8%). The most frequent symptoms included fever, rash and headache. Initial leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were lower in patients who presented in the early phase (0-4 days), however, platelet count was lower and AST, ALT and LDH activity higher in patients with a longer symptoms duration (>/=5 days). The clinical course was mostly uncomplicated. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue fever is becoming a frequent cause of fever in Czech travellers. Clinicians should be familiar with the typical clinical findings and novel diagnostic methods.","['Trojanek, Milan', 'Maixner, Jan', 'Sojkova, Nadezda', 'Kyncl, Jan', 'Rohacova, Hana', 'Maresova, Vilma', 'Stejskal, Frantisek']","['Trojanek M', 'Maixner J', 'Sojkova N', 'Kyncl J', 'Rohacova H', 'Maresova V', 'Stejskal F']",,"['1st Department of Infectious Diseases, 2nd Medical Faculty, Charles University in Prague, Budinova 2, 180 81 Prague, Czech Republic; Department of Infectious, Parasitic and Tropical Diseases, Hospital Na Bulovce, Budinova 2, 180 81 Prague, Czech Republic.

METHODS: We reviewed 696 consecutive returned travelers managed at an Australian tertiary-care hospital for an illness acquired overseas. Patients with dengue fever were compared to those with a dengue-like illness, malaria, typhoid fever and rickettsial infections. RESULTS: In total, 19 cases of dengue fever and 20 cases of dengue-like illness were diagnosed, with 85% of cases acquired in Asia. The most common presenting features of dengue were fever (100%), myalgia (79%), rash (74%), headache (68%), nausea (37%), and diarrhea (37%). Compared to those with malaria, typhoid fever and rickettsial infections, patients with dengue were significantly more likely to have myalgia and a temperature <39 degrees C. Compared to all other illnesses in our returned travelers, dengue fever was 18 times more likely if fever and leukopenia were present, 71 times if fever and rash were present, and 230 times if fever, rash and leukopenia were present. All patients with dengue recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue fever is an important health problem for travelers not only to Southeast Asia but to all endemic countries. The prevalence appears to be increasing in travelers, and health care professionals need to be familiar with its presentation in travelers. The clinical presenting features provide important guides to establishing the diagnosis.","['Sung, Valerie', ""O'Brien, Daniel P"", 'Matchett, Elizabeth', 'Brown, Graham V', 'Torresi, Joseph']","['Sung V', ""O'Brien DP"", 'Matchett E', 'Brown GV', 'Torresi J']",,"['Victorian Infectious Disease Service, Royal Melbourne Hospital, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Travel Med,Journal of travel medicine,9434456,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asia, Southeastern', 'Dengue/blood/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Travel', 'Victoria/epidemiology']",,2003/08/30 05:00,2003/12/11 05:00,['2003/08/30 05:00'],"['2003/08/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.2310/7060.2003.40555 [doi]'],ppublish,J Travel Med. 2003 Jul-Aug;10(4):208-13. doi: 10.2310/7060.2003.40555.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The related arbovirus, West Nile virus, has been shown to be transfusion transmitted, which, added to the four recorded dengue transfusion-associated cases, indicates that DENV is also transfusion transmitted. The purpose of this study was to assess the risk of transfusion-transmitted DENV during a 2004 outbreak in the Australian city of Cairns. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A mathematical model was constructed to estimate the risk of transfusion-transmitted dengue. The model's central premise is that the transmission risk is proportional to the frequency of dengue-viremic donations and correlates with the incidence of asymptomatic dengue viremia among the population at large. RESULTS: The modeling predicted that the total number of DENV infections (clinical plus subclinical) among the population at large during the entire outbreak ranged from 156 to 569 with the epidemic peak occurring between February 8 and March 6, 2004. The overall transmission risk during the entire outbreak was estimated as 1 in 19,759 (range, 1 in 3404 to 75,486) peaking at 1 in 5968 (range 1 in 1028 to 22,800). CONCLUSION: By use of the most conservative estimates for key variables, the risk of collecting a viremic donation could have been as high as 1 in 1028 during the peak of the 2004 outbreak. The model can be used to determine transfusion transmission risk levels during DENV outbreaks and inform decisions as to when fresh component restriction measures are required to minimize transfusion transmission risk.","['Seed, Clive R', 'Kiely, Philip', 'Hyland, Catherine A', 'Keller, Anthony J']","['Seed CR', 'Kiely P', 'Hyland CA', 'Keller AJ']",,"['Australian Red Cross Blood Service, University of Western Australia, 69 Walters Drive, Osborne Park, WA 6017, Australia. cseed@arcbs.redcross.org.au']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090331,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Australia/epidemiology', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*transmission/virology', 'Humans', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Risk Assessment', '*Transfusion Reaction']",,2009/04/25 09:00,2009/08/01 09:00,['2009/04/25 09:00'],"['2009/04/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [medline]']","['TRF02159 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2009.02159.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2009 Jul;49(7):1482-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2009.02159.x.

In this article, we aimed to systematically review and analyze the association between different blood groups and severity of dengue. We searched nine databases for eligible papers reporting prevalence, distribution, and frequency of blood group type among dengue patients. Network meta-analysis using R software was used to analyze the data. Of a total of 63 reports screened, we included 10 studies with total sample size 1977 patients (1382 DF and 595 DHF). Blood group O was found to have the worst outcome with the highest risk of developing DF (P-score = 0.01) followed by group B (P-score = 0.34), group A (P-score = 0.64), and group AB (P-score = 1), respectively. Blood group O also had the worst outcome with highest risk of developing DHF (P-score = 0.1) followed by group B (P-score = 0.29), group A (P-score = 0.61), and group AB (P-score = 1), respectively. There was a significant increase (P-value <.001) in the overall odds risk of dengue infection among patients with Rhesus-positive blood groups [OR = 540.03; (95% CI = 151.48-1925.18)]. However, there was no significant difference in the odds risk of DF when compared to DHF according to Rhesus status (P-value = .954). This study identified the O blood group as a potential risk factor in predicting clinical severity in dengue patients which may be helpful in evaluating patients for their likely need for critical care.","['Hashan, Mohammad Rashidul', 'Ghozy, Sherief', 'El-Qushayri, Amr Ehab', 'Pial, Rejwana Haque', 'Hossain, Md Anwar', 'Al Kibria, Gulam Muhammed']","['Hashan MR', 'Ghozy S', 'El-Qushayri AE', 'Pial RH', 'Hossain MA', 'Al Kibria GM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1627-4976', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5629-3023', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7012-7889', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8215-9792', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7037-6658']","['Bangladesh Civil Service, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Bangladesh, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Minia University, Minia, Egypt.', 'Infectious Disease Division, International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'Infectious Disease Division, International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20200810,England,Rev Med Virol,Reviews in medical virology,9112448,['0 (Blood Group Antigens)'],IM,"['*Blood Group Antigens', '*Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,2020/08/11 06:00,2022/01/04 06:00,['2020/08/11 06:00'],"['2020/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/rmv.2147 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Med Virol. 2021 Jan;31(1):1-9. doi: 10.1002/rmv.2147.

Quantifying this burden is critical to set policy priorities and disease-control strategies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimated the economic and disease burden of dengue in 12 countries in SEA: Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, East-Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. We obtained reported cases from multiple sources--surveillance data, World Health Organization (WHO), and published studies--and adjusted for underreporting using expansion factors from previous literature. We obtained unit costs per episode through a systematic literature review, and completed missing data using linear regressions. We excluded costs such as prevention and vector control, and long-term sequelae of dengue. Over the decade of 2001-2010, we obtained an annual average of 2.9 million (m) dengue episodes and 5,906 deaths. The annual economic burden (with 95% certainty levels) was US$950m (US$610m-US$1,384m) or about US$1.65 (US$1.06-US$2.41) per capita. The annual number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), based on the original 1994 definition, was 214,000 (120,000-299,000), which is equivalent to 372 (210-520) DALYs per million inhabitants. CONCLUSION: Dengue poses a substantial economic and disease burden in SEA with a DALY burden per million inhabitants in the region. This burden is higher than that of 17 other conditions, including Japanese encephalitis, upper respiratory infections, and hepatitis B.","['Shepard, Donald S', 'Undurraga, Eduardo A', 'Halasa, Yara A']","['Shepard DS', 'Undurraga EA', 'Halasa YA']",,"['Schneider Institutes for Health Policy, Heller School for Social Policy and Management, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA. shepard@brandeis.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20130221,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Asia, Southeastern/epidemiology', '*Cost of Illness', 'Dengue/*economics/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC3578748,2013/02/26 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['PNTD-D-12-00973 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0002055 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2013;7(2):e2055. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002055.

The natural reservoir of dengue is now constituted by urban human populations; travellers are the only dissemination factor of the viruses from one country to another, and all vectors are domestic species of the genus Aedes; in these mosquitoes, a vertical transmission can take place. The persistence mechanisms of dengue fever are closely related to demographic explosion, uncontrolled growth of towns and deterioration of urban environment which comes of it. The spreading mechanisms of outbreaks are related to dramatic increase of travels and the variable susceptibility of the natural Aedes populations to the viruses. All these factors appear to be directly connected with human activities; they were submitted to considerable changes since World War II and the epidemiology of the disease has been widely modified; the incidence of the disease is continuously growing year after year, building up a very worrying situation, more especially as we have no etiologic treatment nor vaccine against it.","['Rodhain, F']",['Rodhain F'],,"[""Unite d'Ecologie des Systemes Vectoriels, Institut Pasteur, Paris.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Netherlands,Bull Acad Natl Med,Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine,7503383,,IM,"['Asia, Southeastern/epidemiology', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Humans']",,1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Acad Natl Med. 1992 Feb;176(2):223-36; discussion 236-9.,2,,,,,,,,,Quelques donnees recentes concernant l'epidemiologie de la dengue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This retrospective study aimed to assess the clinical manifestation of dengue and outcome in renal transplant recipients. METHODS: Renal transplant recipients diagnosed with dengue in the nephrology department during the outbreak from August 2015 to December 2015 were included in the study. RESULTS: Twenty patients developed dengue presenting during the outbreak. Mean age was 31.9 +/- 8.8 years and all were males. Two patients had severe dengue (dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue shock syndrome). Clinical presentation included febrile illness (95%), myalgia (65%), headache (30%), retro-orbital pain (10%), and mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations (10%). Three (15%) had third space fluid accumulation and 2 (10%) had hypotension. Ninety percent patients had thrombocytopenia, with 4 requiring platelet transfusion. Leucopenia (WBC < 4000/mm(3) ) developed in 50% patients. About 60% had transient transaminitis. One patient with severed dengue expired and 1 recovered with IV immunoglobulin therapy. About 40% patients had rise in serum creatinine, with complete recovery in all patients. CONCLUSION: Clinical manifestations of dengue infection in renal transplant recipients were similar to that in general population. However, leucopenia necessitating temporary withdrawal of immunosuppression was common. Renal dysfunction was frequent but completely reversible.","['Subbiah, Arunkumar', 'Bagchi, Soumita', 'Bhowmik, Dipankar', 'Mahajan, Sandeep', 'Yadav, Raj K', 'Chhabra, Yogesh', 'Agarwal, Sanjay']","['Subbiah A', 'Bagchi S', 'Bhowmik D', 'Mahajan S', 'Yadav RK', 'Chhabra Y', 'Agarwal S']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5925-9111', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1562-9912']","['Department of Nephrology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Nephrology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Nephrology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Nephrology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Nephrology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Nephrology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Nephrology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180330,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,,IM,"['Adult', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology/virology', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Kidney/pathology/virology', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Leukopenia', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severe Dengue/*epidemiology/etiology/virology', 'Transplant Recipients/*statistics & numerical data', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",,2018/03/08 06:00,2018/11/22 06:00,['2018/03/08 06:00'],"['2017/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/03/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tid.12875 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2018 Jun;20(3):e12875. doi: 10.1111/tid.12875.

Understanding the complex interplay of climatic and socioeconomic trends is imperative to protect human health and lessen the burden of diseases such as dengue fever. Dengue fever is rapidly expanding globally. Temperature, rainfall, and frequency of natural disasters, as well as non-climatic trends involving population growth and migration, urbanization, and international trade and travel, are expected to increase the prevalence of mosquito breeding sites, mosquito survival, the speed of mosquito reproduction, the speed of viral incubation, the distribution of dengue virus and its vectors, human migration patterns towards urban areas, and displacement after natural disasters. The burden of dengue disproportionately affects the poor due to increased environmental risk and decreased health care. Mobilization of social institutions is needed to improve the structural inequalities of poverty that predispose the poor to increased dengue fever infection and worse outcomes. This paper reviews the link between dengue and climatic factors as a starting point to developing a comprehensive understanding of how climate change affects dengue risk and how institutions can address the issues of social justice and dengue outbreaks that increasingly affect vulnerable urban populations.","['Chang, Aileen Y', 'Fuller, Douglas O', 'Carrasquillo, Olveen', 'Beier, John C']","['Chang AY', 'Fuller DO', 'Carrasquillo O', 'Beier JC']",,"['Clinical Instructor of Medicine at the in the Department of General Internal Medicine at the University of Miami.', 'Professor of Geography in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Miami.', 'Professor of Medicine and Public Health Sciences in the Department of General Internal Medicine at the University of Miami.', 'Professor of Epidemiology and Public Health Sciences at the University of Miami.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140614,United States,Health Hum Rights,Health and human rights,9502498,,IM,"['*Climate Change', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Disasters', 'Humans', '*Social Justice', 'Vulnerable Populations']",,2014/12/05 06:00,2016/10/08 06:00,['2014/12/05 06:00'],"['2014/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Health Hum Rights. 2014 Jun 14;16(1):93-104.,1,"['Copyright (c) 2014 Chang, Fuller, Carrasquillo, Beier.

Early entomological data and modelling analyses have suggested promising outcomes, and wMel Wolbachia releases are now ongoing or planned in 12 countries. To help inform government, donor, or philanthropist decisions on scale-up beyond single city releases, we assessed this technology's cost-effectiveness under alternative programmatic options. METHODS: Using costing data from existing Wolbachia releases, previous dynamic model-based estimates of Wolbachia effectiveness, and a spatially explicit model of release and surveillance requirements, we predicted the costs and effectiveness of the ongoing programme in Yogyakarta City and three new hypothetical programmes in Yogyakarta Special Autonomous Region, Jakarta, and Bali. RESULTS: We predicted Wolbachia to be a highly cost-effective intervention when deployed in high-density urban areas with gross cost-effectiveness below $1500 per DALY averted. When offsets from the health system and societal perspective were included, such programmes even became cost saving over 10-year time horizons with favourable benefit-cost ratios of 1.35 to 3.40. Sequencing Wolbachia releases over 10 years could reduce programme costs by approximately 38% compared to simultaneous releases everywhere, but also delays the benefits. Even if unexpected challenges occurred during deployment, such as emergence of resistance in the medium-term or low effective coverage, Wolbachia would remain a cost-saving intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Wolbachia releases in high-density urban areas are expected to be highly cost-effective and could potentially be the first cost-saving intervention for dengue. Sites with strong public health infrastructure, fiscal capacity, and community support should be prioritised.","['Brady, Oliver J', 'Kharisma, Dinar D', 'Wilastonegoro, Nandyan N', ""O'Reilly, Kathleen M"", 'Hendrickx, Emilie', 'Bastos, Leonardo S', 'Yakob, Laith', 'Shepard, Donald S']","['Brady OJ', 'Kharisma DD', 'Wilastonegoro NN', ""O'Reilly KM"", 'Hendrickx E', 'Bastos LS', 'Yakob L', 'Shepard DS']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3235-2129'],"['Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK. oliver.brady@lshtm.ac.uk.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK. oliver.brady@lshtm.ac.uk.', 'Heller School for Social Policy and Management, Brandeis University,, Waltham, MA, USA.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Public Health and Nursing, Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.', 'Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Infectious Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Infectious Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Heller School for Social Policy and Management, Brandeis University,, Waltham, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200709,England,BMC Med,BMC medicine,101190723,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis/*methods', 'Dengue/*economics/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Indonesia/epidemiology', 'Wolbachia/*pathogenicity']",PMC7346418,2020/07/10 06:00,2021/02/04 06:00,['2020/07/10 06:00'],"['2020/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12916-020-01638-2 [pii]', '1638 [pii]', '10.1186/s12916-020-01638-2 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med. 2020 Jul 9;18(1):186. doi: 10.1186/s12916-020-01638-2.,1,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cost-effectiveness analysis', 'Dengue', 'Indonesia', 'Maps', 'Model', 'Mosquito', 'Policy', 'Spatial', 'Wolbachia']",['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,"['206471/Z/17/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'OPP1187889/Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation/International', '206471/Z/17/Z/Wellcome Trust (GB)/International', 'OP1183567/Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no studies have systematically assessed the frequency of PE in patients with dengue, and whether this differs across age and imaging modality. METHODS: We searched Pubmed, Embase Web of Science and Lilacs (period 1900-2021) for studies reporting on PE in dengue patients (hospitalized and outpatient). We defined PE as fluid in the thoracic cavity detected by any imaging test. The study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021228862). Complicated dengue was defined as hemorrhagic fever, dengue shock syndrome or severe dengue. RESULTS: The search identified 2,157 studies of which 85 studies were eligible for inclusion. The studies (n = 31 children, n = 10 adults, n = 44 mixed age) involved 12,800 patients (30% complicated dengue). The overall frequency of PE was 33% [95%CI: 29 to 37%] and the rate of PE increased significantly with disease severity (P = 0.001) such that in complicated vs. uncomplicated dengue the frequencies were 48% and 17% (P < 0.001). When assessing all studies, PE occurred significantly more often in children compared to adults (43% vs. 13%, P = 0.002) and lung ultrasound more frequently detected PE than conventional chest X-ray (P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: We found that 1/3 of dengue patients presented with PE and the frequency increased with severity and younger age. Importantly, lung ultrasound demonstrated the highest rate of detection. Our findings suggest that PE is a relatively common finding in dengue and that bedside imaging tools, such as lung ultrasound, potentially may enhance detection.","['Kaagaard, Molly D', 'Matos, Luan Oliveira', 'Evangelista, Marliton V P', 'Wegener, Alma', 'Holm, Anna Engell', 'Vestergaard, Lasse S', 'Do Valle, Suiane C N', 'Silvestre, Odilson M', 'Lacerda, Marcus Vinicius Guimaraes', 'de Souza, Rodrigo Medeiros', 'Barreto Dos Santos, Flavia', 'Biering-Sorensen, Tor', 'Brainin, Philip']","['Kaagaard MD', 'Matos LO', 'Evangelista MVP', 'Wegener A', 'Holm AE', 'Vestergaard LS', 'Do Valle SCN', 'Silvestre OM', 'Lacerda MVG', 'de Souza RM', 'Barreto Dos Santos F', 'Biering-Sorensen T', 'Brainin P']",,"['Multidisciplinary Center, Federal University of Acre, Campus Floresta, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil. mollykaagaard@gmail.com.', 'Cardiovascular Non-Invasive Imaging Research Laboratory, Department of Cardiology, Herlev-Gentofte University Hospital, Hellerup, Denmark. mollykaagaard@gmail.com.', 'Multidisciplinary Center, Federal University of Acre, Campus Floresta, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil.', 'Multidisciplinary Center, Federal University of Acre, Campus Floresta, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil.', 'Multidisciplinary Center, Federal University of Acre, Campus Floresta, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil.', 'Cardiovascular Non-Invasive Imaging Research Laboratory, Department of Cardiology, Herlev-Gentofte University Hospital, Hellerup, Denmark.', 'Multidisciplinary Center, Federal University of Acre, Campus Floresta, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil.', 'Cardiovascular Non-Invasive Imaging Research Laboratory, Department of Cardiology, Herlev-Gentofte University Hospital, Hellerup, Denmark.', 'Department of Bacteria, Parasites and Fungi, National Malaria Reference Laboratory, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Multidisciplinary Center, Federal University of Acre, Campus Floresta, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil.', 'Health and Sport Science Center, Federal University of Acre, Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil.', 'Foundation of Tropical Medicine Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado, Fiocruz, Manaus, Brazil.', 'University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, USA.', 'Multidisciplinary Center, Federal University of Acre, Campus Floresta, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Host-Virus Interactions, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Cardiovascular Non-Invasive Imaging Research Laboratory, Department of Cardiology, Herlev-Gentofte University Hospital, Hellerup, Denmark.', 'Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Multidisciplinary Center, Federal University of Acre, Campus Floresta, Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil.', 'Cardiovascular Non-Invasive Imaging Research Laboratory, Department of Cardiology, Herlev-Gentofte University Hospital, Hellerup, Denmark.', 'Sound Bioventures, Hellerup, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20230515,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Severe Dengue/complications/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology', 'Exudates and Transudates', '*Pleural Effusion/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/complications', 'Plasma', 'Ultrasonography', '*Dengue/complications/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology']",PMC10184094,2023/05/16 01:09,2023/05/17 06:42,['2023/05/15 23:34'],"['2023/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2023/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/05/17 06:42 [medline]', '2023/05/16 01:09 [pubmed]', '2023/05/15 23:34 [entrez]']","['10.1186/s12879-023-08311-y [pii]', '8311 [pii]', '10.1186/s12879-023-08311-y [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2023 May 15;23(1):327. doi: 10.1186/s12879-023-08311-y.,1,['(c) 2023.

This study aims to understand the diversity, epidemiology and dynamics of DENV 4-I. We collected 404 full length DENV4-1 envelope (E) gene sequences from 14 countries using two sources: Yunnan Province in China (15 strains during 2013-2016) and GenBank (489 strains up to 2018-01-11). Conducting phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses, we estimated the virus spread, population dynamics, and selection pressures using different statistical analysis methods (substitution saturation, likelihood mapping, Bayesian coalescent inference, and maximum likelihood estimation). Our results show that during the last 60 years (1956-2016), DENV 4-I was present in mainland and maritime Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the southern provinces of China, parts of Brazil and Australia. The recent spread of DENV 4-I likely originated in the Philippines and later spread to Thailand. From Thailand, it spread to adjacent countries and eventually the Indian subcontinent. Apparently diverging around years 1957, 1963, 1976 and 1990, the different Clades (Clade I-V) were defined. The mean overall evolution rate of DENV 4-I was 9.74 (95% HPD: 8.68-10.82) x 10-4 nucleotide substitutions/site/year. The most recent common ancestor for DENV 4-I traces back to 1956. While the demographic history of DENV 4-I fluctuated, peaks appeared around 1982 and 2006. While purifying selection dominated the majority of E-gene evolution of DENV 4-I, positive selection characterized Clade III (Vietnam). DENV 4-I evolved in situ in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Thailand and Indian acted as the main and secondary virus distribution hubs globally and regionally. Our phylogenetic analysis highlights the need for strengthened regional cooperation on surveillance and sharing of sample sequences to improve global dengue control and cross-border transmission prevention efforts.","['Sang, Shaowei', 'Liu-Helmersson, Jing', 'Quam, Mikkel B M', 'Zhou, Hongning', 'Guo, Xiaofang', 'Wu, Haixia', 'Liu, Qiyong']","['Sang S', 'Liu-Helmersson J', 'Quam MBM', 'Zhou H', 'Guo X', 'Wu H', 'Liu Q']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6298-4621'],"[""Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Epidemiology and Global Health, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Global Health, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', ""Yunnan Provincial Center of Arborvirus Research, Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Vector-borne Diseases Control and Research, Yunnan Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Pu'er, Yunnan, People's Republic of China."", ""Yunnan Provincial Center of Arborvirus Research, Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Vector-borne Diseases Control and Research, Yunnan Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Pu'er, Yunnan, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190729,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['China', 'Dengue/epidemiology/*history/transmission/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*genetics', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome, Viral', 'Genotype', 'Global Health', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Phylogeography']",PMC6663010,2019/07/30 06:00,2019/12/24 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2018/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['PNTD-D-18-01752 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0007592 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2019 Jul 29;13(7):e0007592. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007592. eCollection 2019 Jul.,7,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A cost-benefit analysis was performed from the social perspective. A program to control both adult mosquitoes and immature forms was compared to a nonintervention hypothesis, from January to April 2007, in the city of Clorinda, Argentina. Direct costs, as well as indirect and intangible benefits, were taken into account and standardized in international dollars (I$) using purchasing power parity. An incidence rate of 50 cases of dengue per 1000 inhabitants was used in the non-intervention hypothesis. RESULTS: From January to April 2007 there were 176 cases of dengue in Clorinda, but only five were autochthonous. The net present value was I$ 196,879 with the control strategy, whereas the non-intervention was calculated to be I$ -106,724, indicating a savings of I$ 303,602 (I$ 6.46 per inhabitant) for the intervention. The sensitivity analysis showed that, with more than 1363 cases of dengue (total incidence rate of 29 per 1000 inhabitants) and one case of dengue hemorrhagic fever, there is a cost-benefit to intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that vector control, including fumigation of adult mosquitoes, should be considered in high-risk areas as a cost-effective option for nonendemic countries.","['Orellano, Pablo Wenceslao', 'Pedroni, Elena']","['Orellano PW', 'Pedroni E']",,"['Ministerio de Salud de la Nacion, Argentina, Direccion de Epidemiologia. porellano@msal.gov.ar']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Rev Panam Salud Publica,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,9705400,,IM,"['*Aedes', 'Animals', 'Argentina', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Dengue/*economics/*prevention & control/transmission', '*Disease Vectors', 'Humans', 'Mosquito Control/*economics']",,2008/12/10 09:00,2009/03/06 09:00,['2008/12/10 09:00'],"['2008/12/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/12/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1020-49892008000800005 [pii]', '10.1590/s1020-49892008000800005 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Panam Salud Publica. 2008 Aug;24(2):113-9. doi: 10.1590/s1020-49892008000800005.,2,,,,,,,,,Analisis costo-beneficio del control de vectores en la transmision potencial de dengue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Triage algorithms and appropriate reporting systems are useful to manage patients and prioritize resources. We identify possible adaptations to these systems to improve the management of patients during epidemics. METHODS: In a prospective observational study in the adult emergency department (ED) of a tertiary care hospital, we enrolled all patients with febrile illness and a confirmed diagnosis of dengue (ribonucleic acid identification). We then retrospectively classified cases according to the initial clinical presentation at the ED. RESULTS: We enrolled 715 patients (332 male patients), aged 14 to 91 years (median 35 years). Severe illness was documented in 332 cases (46.4%) and was mostly caused by serotype 2, or a secondary infection of any serotype. Severe forms included dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome (104/332; 31.3%), severe bleeding (9/332; 2.7%), and acute organ failure (56/332; 16.9%). The other patients with severe illness (171/332; 51.5%) presented with symptoms of presyncope, intense weakness, prolonged gastrointestinal symptoms, and hypotension. This presentation was common during epidemics and appeared to be associated with dehydration and electrolyte loss that improved markedly within 24 hours with saline solution infusion. This group did not have evidence of plasma leakage, although similar features were observed in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. CONCLUSION: Dengue has a wide range of clinical presentations in the ED. Many patients who appear seriously ill on presentation will respond to intravenous fluids.","['Thomas, Laurent', 'Moravie, Victor', 'Besnier, Francois', 'Valentino, Ruddy', 'Kaidomar, Stephane', 'Coquet, Laurent Villain', 'Najioullah, Fatiha', 'Lengelle, Francois', 'Cesaire, Raymond', 'Cabie, Andre']","['Thomas L', 'Moravie V', 'Besnier F', 'Valentino R', 'Kaidomar S', 'Coquet LV', 'Najioullah F', 'Lengelle F', 'Cesaire R', 'Cabie A']",,"['Emergency and Intensive Care Department, University Hospital, Fort-de-France, Martinique. laurent.thomas@chu-fortdefrance.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110908,United States,Ann Emerg Med,Annals of emergency medicine,8002646,,IM,"['Academic Medical Centers/statistics & numerical data', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology/therapy', '*Emergency Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical data', 'Epidemics/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Martinique/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Triage', 'Young Adult']",,2011/09/10 06:00,2012/02/16 06:00,['2011/09/10 06:00'],"['2011/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0196-0644(11)01451-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.annemergmed.2011.08.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Emerg Med. 2012 Jan;59(1):42-50. doi: 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2011.08.010.

In 1990, Malaysia experienced its most severe outbreak of DF/DHF with a record total of 5,590 cases referred to the Division of Virology, Institute for Medical Research (IMR). Of these, 1,880 were confirmed serologically to be DF/DHF. The conventional serological procedure, the Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) test, for the diagnosis of DF/DHF is cumbersome and causes delay in diagnosis. Another problem associated with the HI test has been that it has often been difficult to obtain a second convalescent serum sample for an accurate diagnosis. This has raised an urgent need to establish a ""rapid"" test for diagnosis of DF/DHF. As such the authors recently carried out an evaluation of a newly available commercial rapid test, namely, the Dengue Blot Assay (Diagnostic Biotechnology Singapore Pte Ltd). The test is intended for use in laboratory confirmation of dengue virus infection. The evaluation was to determine if the test could be utilised as a routine laboratory test and to establish its sensitivity and specificity. Over 400 samples were tested against the Dengue Blot Assay. Results were checked against an in-house Dengue IgM ELISA and HI assay. Preliminary results indicate that the sensitivity and specificity of the Dengue Blot is satisfactory. Our results also indicate that the Dengue Blot has a useful role to play in a routine laboratory especially since it provides rapid results on single serum samples thereby reducing the workload in a busy diagnostic laboratory.","['Fang, R', 'Sinniah, M', 'Kuen, L S']","['Fang R', 'Sinniah M', 'Kuen LS']",,"['Division of Virology, Institute for Medical Research, Kuala Lumpur.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Malaysia,Malays J Pathol,The Malaysian journal of pathology,8101177,"['0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)']",IM,"['Dengue/blood/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Dengue Virus/*isolation & purification', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests', 'Humans', 'Malaysia', '*Reagent Kits, Diagnostic']",,1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Malays J Pathol. 1992 Dec;14(2):117-20.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly 90% of infections occur in children. At present, prospective information on clinical and laboratory findings in South Asian children with dengue is generally lacking. AIM: To describe patterns of clinical disease in a cohort of children hospitalised with dengue during a major dengue epidemic in Sri Lanka. RESULTS: A total of 104 children were studied during a three month period. Eighteen had dengue fever (DF) and 86 had dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Of those with DHF, 34, 23, 27, and 2 had DHF grade I, II, III, and IV respectively. Based on dengue serology testing, 13 of the DF patients had a primary infection and 5 had secondary dengue infections. In contrast, 68 of the children with DHF had secondary and 18 had primary dengue infections. Oral candidiasis was seen in 19 children. The odds ratio for children with secondary dengue infection to develop DHF was 9.8 (95% CI 3.1 to 31.2). CONCLUSION: Studies on patterns of paediatric dengue disease in different regions should help clinicians and health administrators make more informed and evidence based health planning decisions. It should also help towards mapping out dengue trends on a global scale. Oral candidiasis has not been previously documented in children suffering with acute dengue in Sri Lanka or elsewhere. Studying underlying reasons for this manifestation during future dengue epidemics may provide useful leads in understanding overall dengue pathogenesis.","['Malavige, G N', 'Ranatunga, P K', 'Velathanthiri, V G N S', 'Fernando, S', 'Karunatilaka, D H', 'Aaskov, J', 'Seneviratne, S L']","['Malavige GN', 'Ranatunga PK', 'Velathanthiri VG', 'Fernando S', 'Karunatilaka DH', 'Aaskov J', 'Seneviratne SL']",,"['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayawardenapura, Sri Lanka.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20060131,England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/complications/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/complications', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Malnutrition/complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Serologic Tests', 'Severe Dengue/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Sex Factors', 'Sri Lanka', 'Unconsciousness/microbiology']",PMC2082720,2006/02/02 09:00,2006/05/13 09:00,['2006/02/02 09:00'],"['2006/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['adc.2005.085191 [pii]', 'ac85191 [pii]', '10.1136/adc.2005.085191 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2006 May;91(5):396-400. doi: 10.1136/adc.2005.085191.

The preliminary results of the longitudinal study of epidemiology of dengue in Malaysia is also presented. Studies led by Rudnick et al. over some 18 years have established that the disease is endemically transmitted by both Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus causing illnesses ranging from mild febrile episodes through classical dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever and the dengue shock syndrome. The first epidemic occurred in 1962 in Penang, and the second major epidemic in 1974 in Selangor. From then on epidemics seem to occur every 4 years, i.e. 1978, and then in 1982. With increasing number of cases being seen from the end of 1985 and in 1986, and with the increasing numbers of positive virus isolates, another epidemic may occur this year. Though in the early years, mainly children were affected, recently more cases are being seen in 16-30 years age group. There is also a changing pattern in the clinical presentation of the cases. The clinician has to be aware of the various modes of presentation of this sinister disease. A high index of suspicion is needed for early diagnosis, as management is mainly symptomatic and there is no specific drug as yet to combat the shock and bleeding manifestations.","['George, R']",['George R'],,"['General Hospital, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Thailand,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,The Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health,0266303,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Malaysia', 'Male']",,1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health. 1987 Sep;18(3):278-83.,3,,,,,,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two studies were performed in countries with high dengue incidence, to assess the diagnostic performance of different PCR techniques. METHODS/RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-nine acute phase blood samples from febrile patients were analyzed for DENV by the RealStar Dengue RT-PCR kit (Altona Diagnostics) as gold standard in comparison with the Tropical Fever Core multiplex PCR (Fast Track Diagnostics). In total, 102 samples collected in Savannakhet Province (Lao PDR, Southeast Asia) in 2013 and 35 samples from Valledupar (Colombia, South America) tested positive for DENV by RealStar RT-PCR. In comparison, the Tropical Fever Core multiplex PCR detected 65.0% (65/102) and 68.6% (24/35) of these samples as positive for DENV in Savannakhet and Valledupar, respectively. Diagnostic sensitivity of the multiplex PCR strongly correlated with viral load. A subset of DENV PCR-confirmed samples was additionally tested by BNITM in house Dengue Type RT-PCR in comparison with two commercial test kits (RealStar Dengue Type RT-PCR [Altona Diagnostics], Dengue differentiation PCR [Fast Track Diagnostics]). The leading dengue serotype in Savannakhet was DENV-3 (58% [29/50]), while DENV-1 (53.8% [14/26]) was the predominant serotype found in samples collected in Valledupar by BNITM-type PCR. However, three DENV serotypes were circulating in Valledupar and in Savannakhet. In 2015, additional studies found predominantly DENV-4 (71% [12/17]) in Savannakhet. CONCLUSIONS: Both studies emphasized that routine diagnostics in both regions will benefit from an expanded use of highly sensitive pan-dengue PCRs.","['Kann, Simone', 'Blessmann, Joerg', 'Winkelmann, Yvonne', 'Hansen, Jessica', 'Maya Amaya, Leonardo J', 'Rivera Salcedo, Gadith E', 'Halas, Hussein El', 'Schmidt-Chanasit, Jonas', 'Keoviengkhone, Latdamone', 'Sopraseuth, Vatsana', 'Deschermeier, Christina', 'Mika, Angela']","['Kann S', 'Blessmann J', 'Winkelmann Y', 'Hansen J', 'Maya Amaya LJ', 'Rivera Salcedo GE', 'Halas HE', 'Schmidt-Chanasit J', 'Keoviengkhone L', 'Sopraseuth V', 'Deschermeier C', 'Mika A']",,"['Medical Mission Institute, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department for Implementation Research, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Diagnostics Development Laboratory, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Diagnostics Development Laboratory, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Hospital Eduardo Arredondo Daza, Valledupar, Colombia.', 'Hospital Eduardo Arredondo Daza, Valledupar, Colombia.', 'Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Arbovirology, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Savannakhet Provincial Hospital, Savannakhet, Lao PDR.', 'Savannakhet Provincial Hospital, Savannakhet, Lao PDR.', 'Diagnostics Development Laboratory, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Diagnostics Development Laboratory, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210914,England,Trop Med Int Health,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,9610576,,IM,"['Colombia/epidemiology', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/virology', 'Dengue Virus/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2021/08/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:00,['2021/08/27 17:45'],"['2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/27 17:45 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tmi.13670 [doi]'],ppublish,Trop Med Int Health. 2021 Oct;26(10):1296-1302. doi: 10.1111/tmi.13670.

Timely diagnosis and mosquito control are only ways to prevent outbreaks; however there are very few studies demonstrating this hypothesis. METHODS: During this study laboratory diagnosis for Dengue was provided to patient and the programme manager on the same day of receipt of the sample. The mobile number of the patient/kin of patient was used to contact patient and reach their address to conduct vector control within 24h of case detection. RESULTS: Eighty three present cases were diagnosed within 24h and 82% houses were surveyed within 24h of reporting of the positive cases. The prompt diagnosis proactive vector control model helped keeping dengue outbreaks at bay. CONCLUSION: Timely diagnosis and prompt vector control activities can prevent dengue outbreaks.

Dengue vaccines currently in development should help reduce the burden associated with this disease but the most efficient way of using future dengue vaccines remains to be defined. Mathematical models of transmission can provide insight into the expected impact of different vaccination strategies at a population level and contribute to this definition. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed and analyzed an age-structured, host-vector and serotype-specific compartmental model, including seasonality. We first used this transmission model to identify the immunological interactions between serotypes that affect the risks and consequences of secondary infections (cross-protection, increased susceptibility, increased severity, and increased infectiousness) and reproduce the observed epidemiology of dengue. For populating this model, we used routine surveillance data from Southern Vietnam and the results of a prospective cohort study conducted in the same area. The model provided a good fit to the observed data for age, severity of cases, serotype distribution, and dynamics over time, using two scenarios of immunological interaction : short term cross-protection alone (6-17 months) or a combination of short term cross-protection with cross-enhancement (increased susceptibility, severity and infectiousness in the case of secondary infections). Finally, we explored the potential impact of vaccination for these two scenarios. Both highlighted that vaccination can substantially decrease dengue burden by reducing the magnitude and frequency of outbreaks. CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that seasonality and short term cross-protection are key factors for explaining dengue dynamics in Southern Vietnam. Vaccination was predicted to significantly reduce the disease burden, even in the situation where immunological cross-enhancement affects the risks and consequences of secondary infections.","['Coudeville, Laurent', 'Garnett, Geoff P']","['Coudeville L', 'Garnett GP']",,"['Dengue Company, Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France. laurent.coudeville@sanofipasteur.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121210,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Dengue Vaccines)'],IM,"['Calibration', 'Dengue/epidemiology/prevention & control/*transmission', 'Dengue Vaccines/*administration & dosage', 'Dengue Virus/*classification', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Vietnam/epidemiology']",PMC3519629,2012/12/20 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/12/20 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-11-22515 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0051244 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(12):e51244. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0051244.

Dengue virus (DENV) infection leads to a range of outcomes, including subclinical infection, undifferentiated febrile illness, Dengue Fever (DF), life-threatening syndromes with fluid loss and hypotensive shock, or other severe manifestations such as bleeding and organ failure. The long-standing World Health Organization (WHO) dengue classification and management scheme was recently revised, replacing DF, Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) with Dengue without Warning Signs, Dengue with Warning Signs (abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy, liver enlargement, increasing hematocrit with decreasing platelets) and Severe Dengue (SD; dengue with severe plasma leakage, severe bleeding, or organ failure). We evaluated the traditional and revised classification schemes against clinical intervention levels to determine how each captures disease severity using data from five years (2005-2010) of a hospital-based study of pediatric dengue in Managua, Nicaragua. Laboratory-confirmed dengue cases (n = 544) were categorized using both classification schemes and by level of care (I-III). Category I was out-patient care, Category II was in-patient care that did not meet criteria for Category III, which included ICU admission, ventilation, administration of inotropic drugs, or organ failure. Sensitivity and specificity to capture Category III care for DHF/DSS were 39.0% and 75.5%, respectively; sensitivity and specificity for SD were 92.1% and 78.5%, respectively. In this data set, DENV-2 was found to be significantly associated with DHF/DSS; however, this association was not observed with the revised classification. Among dengue-confirmed cases, the revised WHO classification for severe dengue appears to have higher sensitivity and specificity to identify cases in need of heightened care, although it is no longer as specific for a particular pathogenic entity as was the traditional schema.","['Narvaez, Federico', 'Gutierrez, Gamaliel', 'Perez, Maria Angeles', 'Elizondo, Douglas', 'Nunez, Andrea', 'Balmaseda, Angel', 'Harris, Eva']","['Narvaez F', 'Gutierrez G', 'Perez MA', 'Elizondo D', 'Nunez A', 'Balmaseda A', 'Harris E']",,"['Infectious Diseases Unit, Hospital Infantil Manuel de Jesus Rivera, Managua, Nicaragua.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111108,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/complications/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Nicaragua', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Severity of Illness Index', 'Shock/diagnosis/pathology', 'World Health Organization']",PMC3210746,2011/11/17 06:00,2012/03/08 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['PNTD-D-11-00464 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0001397 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2011 Nov;5(11):e1397. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001397.

Properly functioning endothelial cells promote physiological balance and stability for blood circulation and fluid components. A monolayer of endothelial cells has the ability to regulate paracellular and transcellular pathways for transport proteins, solutes, and fluid. In addition to the paracellular pathway, the transcellular pathway is another route of endothelial permeability that mediates vascular permeability under physiologic conditions. The transcellular pathway was found to be associated with an assortment of disease pathogeneses. The clinical manifestation of severe dengue infection in humans is vascular leakage and hemorrhagic diatheses. This review explores and describes the transcellular pathway, which is an alternate route of vascular permeability during dengue infection that corresponds with the pathologic finding of intact tight junction. This pathway may be the route of albumin transport that causes endothelial dysfunction during dengue virus infection.","['Chanthick, Chanettee', 'Suttitheptumrong, Aroonroong', 'Rawarak, Nantapon', 'Pattanakitsakul, Sa-Nga']","['Chanthick C', 'Suttitheptumrong A', 'Rawarak N', 'Pattanakitsakul SN']",,"['Kasetsart University Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Faculty of Veterinay Medicine, Kasetsart University, Bangkok 10900, Thailand. lchanette@gmail.com.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Office for Research and Development, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10700, Thailand. lchanette@gmail.com.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Office for Research and Development, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10700, Thailand. suttitheptumrong@yahoo.com.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Office for Research and Development, 4th Floor SiMR Building, 2 Wanglang Road, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Bangkoknoi, Bangkok 10700, Thailand. suttitheptumrong@yahoo.com.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Office for Research and Development, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10700, Thailand. n_1103@hotmail.com.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Office for Research and Development, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10700, Thailand. sanga.pat@mahidol.ac.th.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Office for Research and Development, 4th Floor SiMR Building, 2 Wanglang Road, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Bangkoknoi, Bangkok 10700, Thailand. sanga.pat@mahidol.ac.th.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180208,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,,IM,"['Biological Transport', '*Capillary Permeability', 'Dengue/diagnosis/immunology/*metabolism/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*physiology', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism/virology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Transcytosis']",PMC5850376,2018/02/09 06:00,2018/09/19 06:00,['2018/02/09 06:00'],"['2017/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['v10020069 [pii]', 'viruses-10-00069 [pii]', '10.3390/v10020069 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2018 Feb 8;10(2):69. doi: 10.3390/v10020069.,2,,['NOTNLM'],"['Thailand', 'dengue virus infection', 'endothelial permeability', 'transcytosis', 'transport system', 'vascular leakage']","['All authors declare no personal or professional conflicts of interest, and no', 'financial support from the companies that produce and/or distribute the drugs,', 'devices, or materials described in this report.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But some patients present persistent symptoms, including fatigue and depression, as acknowledged by the World Health Organization. If persistent symptoms affect a non-negligible share of patients, the burden of dengue will be underestimated. On the basis of a systematic literature review and econometric modeling, we found a significant relationship between the share of patients reporting persisting symptoms and time. We updated estimates of the economic burden of dengue in Mexico, addressing uncertainty in productivity loss and incremental expenses using Monte Carlo simulations. Persistent symptoms represent annually about US$22.6 (95% certainty level [CL]: US$13-US$29) million in incremental costs and 28.2 (95% CL: 21.6-36.2) additional disability-adjusted life years per million population, or 13% and 43% increases over previous estimates, respectively. Although our estimates have uncertainty from limited data, they show a substantial, unmeasured burden.

In contrast, isolating infected individuals with high levels of compliance by the human population is efficient even when implemented with delays during an ongoing outbreak. We also studied insecticide-spraying strategies assuming different (hypothetical) efficiencies. We observed that highly efficient fumigation strategies seem to be effective during an outbreak. Nevertheless, taking into account the controversial results on the use of spraying as a single control strategy, we suggest that carrying out combined strategies of fumigation and isolation during an epidemic outbreak should account for a suitable strategy for the attenuation of epidemic outbreaks.","['Barmak, D H', 'Dorso, C O', 'Otero, M', 'Solari, H G']","['Barmak DH', 'Dorso CO', 'Otero M', 'Solari HG']",,"['Departamento de Fisica, FCEN-UBA and IFIBA-CONICET, Pabellon I, Ciudad Universitaria, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Departamento de Fisica, FCEN-UBA and IFIBA-CONICET, Pabellon I, Ciudad Universitaria, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Departamento de Fisica, FCEN-UBA and IFIBA-CONICET, Pabellon I, Ciudad Universitaria, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Departamento de Fisica, FCEN-UBA and IFIBA-CONICET, Pabellon I, Ciudad Universitaria, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130626,England,Epidemiol Infect,Epidemiology and infection,8703737,['0 (Insecticides)'],IM,"['Aedes', 'Animals', 'Dengue/epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission', 'Disease Outbreaks/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Models, Biological', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Patient Isolation']",PMC9151143,2013/06/27 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0950268813001301 [pii]', '00130 [pii]', '10.1017/S0950268813001301 [doi]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Infect. 2014 Mar;142(3):545-61. doi: 10.1017/S0950268813001301.

To date, there has been no Indian study that has applied this classification. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the accuracy and applicability of the revised WHO classification (2009) of dengue in children seen at a tertiary healthcare facility in India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a period of 1 year children from the pediatric ward and Out Patient Department (OPD) of the King George Medical University Hospital, Lucknow were enrolled in the study according to predefined criteria and tested for dengue. Each dengue-positive patient was classified according to both the older system [dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS)] and the new system (D, DWS, and SD). The severity of dengue was compared to the level of treatment received. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients tested positive for dengue--51 from the pediatric ward and five from the OPD. According to the older WHO classification, 42 (75 %) patients were classified as DF and 13 (23.2 %) as DHF/DSS; one patient was unclassifiable. Five patients (8.9 %) received level 1 treatment, ten (17.8 %) received level 2 treatment, and 41 (73.2 %) received level 3 treatment. According to the new WHO/TDR classification, 46 (82.1 %) patients were classified as SD, nine (16 %) as DWS, and only one (1.7 %) as D. Many of the severe manifestations (encephalopathy, shock, mucosal bleed, platelet count <20,000, respiratory distress, liver enzymes >1,000 U/L) were seen in patients who were classified as DF according to old classification, whereas these patients were mostly classified as SD by the new classification. Sensitivity of the older and new classifications was 24.8 and 98 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The revised WHO/TDR (2009) classification has very high sensitivity for identifying severe dengue and is easy to apply.","['Prasad, D', 'Kumar, Chandrakanta', 'Jain, A', 'Kumar, R']","['Prasad D', 'Kumar C', 'Jain A', 'Kumar R']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, King George Medical University, Lucknow, UP, 226003, India.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20130205,Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Medicine/*methods/*standards', 'Dengue/*classification/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Female', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'India', 'Male', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Severity of Illness Index', 'Tertiary Healthcare']",,2013/02/06 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/02/06 06:00'],"['2012/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s15010-013-0405-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Infection. 2013 Aug;41(4):775-82. doi: 10.1007/s15010-013-0405-3.

The objectives were to study the value of a syndromic surveillance system set up within the armed forces, compared to the traditional clinical surveillance system during this outbreak, to highlight issues involved in comparing military and civilian surveillance systems and to discuss the interest of syndromic surveillance for public health response. METHODS: Military syndromic surveillance allows the surveillance of suspected dengue fever cases among the 3,000 armed forces personnel. Within the same population, clinical surveillance uses several definition criteria for dengue fever cases, depending on the epidemiological situation. Civilian laboratory surveillance allows the surveillance of biologically confirmed cases, within the 200,000 inhabitants. RESULTS: It was shown that syndromic surveillance detected the dengue fever outbreak several weeks before clinical surveillance, allowing quick and effective enhancement of vector control within the armed forces. Syndromic surveillance was also found to have detected the outbreak before civilian laboratory surveillance. CONCLUSION: Military syndromic surveillance allowed an early warning for this outbreak to be issued, enabling a quicker public health response by the armed forces. Civilian surveillance system has since introduced syndromic surveillance as part of its surveillance strategy. This should enable quicker public health responses in the future.","['Meynard, Jean-Baptiste', 'Chaudet, Herve', 'Texier, Gaetan', 'Ardillon, Vanessa', 'Ravachol, Francoise', 'Deparis, Xavier', 'Jefferson, Henry', 'Dussart, Philippe', 'Morvan, Jacques', 'Boutin, Jean-Paul']","['Meynard JB', 'Chaudet H', 'Texier G', 'Ardillon V', 'Ravachol F', 'Deparis X', 'Jefferson H', 'Dussart P', 'Morvan J', 'Boutin JP']",,"['Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, Cayenne 97306, French Guiana. jbmeynard@pasteur-cayenne.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080702,England,BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,BMC medical informatics and decision making,101088682,,IM,"['Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/prevention & control', '*Disease Outbreaks/prevention & control', 'Early Diagnosis', 'French Guiana/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Military Medicine', '*Military Personnel', 'Population Surveillance/*methods']",PMC2459153,2008/07/04 09:00,2008/07/19 09:00,['2008/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['1472-6947-8-29 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6947-8-29 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Inform Decis Mak. 2008 Jul 2;8:29. doi: 10.1186/1472-6947-8-29.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current non-endemic areas are prone to become endemic soon. To improve understanding of dengue transmission in these settings, we assessed the spatiotemporal dynamics of the hitherto largest outbreak in the non-endemic metropolis of Buenos Aires, Argentina, based on detailed information on the 5,104 georeferenced cases registered during summer-autumn of 2016. The highly seasonal dengue transmission in Buenos Aires was modulated by temperature and triggered by imported cases coming from regions with ongoing outbreaks. However, local transmission was made possible and consolidated heterogeneously in the city due to housing and socioeconomic characteristics of the population, with 32.8% of autochthonous cases occurring in slums, which held only 6.4% of the city population. A hierarchical spatiotemporal model accounting for imperfect detection of cases showed that, outside slums, less-affluent neighborhoods of houses (vs. apartments) favored transmission. Global and local spatiotemporal point-pattern analyses demonstrated that most transmission occurred at or close to home. Additionally, based on these results, a point-pattern analysis was assessed for early identification of transmission foci during the outbreak while accounting for population spatial distribution. Altogether, our results reveal how social, physical, and biological processes shape dengue transmission in Buenos Aires and, likely, other non-endemic cities, and suggest multiple opportunities for control interventions.","['Gurevitz, Juan Manuel', 'Antman, Julian Gustavo', 'Laneri, Karina', 'Morales, Juan Manuel']","['Gurevitz JM', 'Antman JG', 'Laneri K', 'Morales JM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5611-8927', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1686-2890', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8536-4695']","['Grupo de Ecologia Cuantitativa, INIBIOMA-CONICET, Universidad Nacional del Comahue, S.C. de Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.', 'Gerencia Operativa de Epidemiologia, Ministerio de Salud de la Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Grupo de Fisica Estadistica e Interdisciplinaria, CONICET, Centro Atomico Bariloche-CNEA, S.C. de Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.', 'Grupo de Ecologia Cuantitativa, INIBIOMA-CONICET, Universidad Nacional del Comahue, S.C. de Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210611,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Animals', 'Argentina/epidemiology', 'Cities/statistics & numerical data', 'Dengue/economics/*epidemiology/*transmission/virology', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Poverty Areas', 'Seasons', 'Temperature', 'Travel']",PMC8221794,2021/06/12 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2021/06/11 17:19'],"['2020/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/06/11 17:19 [entrez]']","['PNTD-D-20-01700 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0009465 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2021 Jun 11;15(6):e0009465. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009465. eCollection 2021 Jun.,6,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This disease appears to affect increasing numbers of adolescents and young adults. OBJECTIVE: The clinical characteristics were described for adult and pediatric dengue inpatients to establish risk factors associated with bad prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of dengue inpatients of years 2006 and 2007 was evaluated retrospectively at ""Clinica Chicamocha"", a high level hospital in Bucaramanga, Colombia. RESULTS: Of 328 patients evaluated, 165 were female and 163 were male with a median age of 25 years. Dengue hemorrhagic fever was diagnosed in 116 patients, of which 113 were classified grade II. Of the 212 patients with dengue fever, 156 developed signs of plasma leakage, bleeding or thrombocytopenia. A positive serology was indicated in 82.4% of the patients. Inpatients with dengue hemorrhagic fever were younger (20.1 vs. 25.7 years, p<0.0054). Both lowest level of platelets and highest hematocrit were reached at the sixth day of illness. Children presented the typical symptoms of dengue less frequently, but demonstrated a greater proportion of ascites, pleural effusion and bleeding, and a higher risk of developing respiratory distress (RR=3.59, 95%CI 1.3-9.9, p<0.014) and hypotension (RR=10.77, 95%CI 5.56-20.86, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Age was the most determinant factor of severity in dengue inpatients. In addition, a combination of particular symptoms and laboratory data at the day of admission may predict the development of complications.","['Gonzalez, Andres Leonardo', 'Martinez, Ruth Arali', 'Villar, Luis Angel']","['Gonzalez AL', 'Martinez RA', 'Villar LA']",,"['Grupo de Epidemiologia Clinica, Centro de Investigaciones Epidemiologicas, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Santander. andreslgonzalezr@gmail.com']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Colombia,Biomedica,Biomedica : revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud,8205605,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colombia', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*pathology/*physiopathology', '*Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,2009/05/26 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2009/05/26 09:00'],"['2009/05/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']",['S0120-41572008000400007 [pii]'],ppublish,Biomedica. 2008 Dec;28(4):531-43.,4,,,,,,,,,"Evolucion clinica de pacientes hospitalizados por dengue en una institucion de salud de Bucaramanga, Colombia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the incidence of the disease have increased in adults but data on clinical and laboratory presentations of those affected are limited. OBJECTIVES: To assess and compare clinical manifestations and laboratory findings of dengue virus infected children and adults in Thailand. STUDY DESIGN: A 1-year study was conducted from September 2003 to August 2004 for dengue virus infected patients admitted to Phetchabun Provincial Hospital, Thailand. Physical signs, symptoms, and laboratory features were recorded. All dengue patients were confirmed using immunochromatographic test on convalescent sera. RESULTS: Based on serology-confirmed dengue virus infection, there was 286 dengue patients including 15 (5.3%) dengue fever and 271 (94.7%) dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Among DHF cases, clinical classifications were DHF I, 40.9%; DHF II, 43%; and DHF III or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), 10.8%. Of all dengue patients, 231 cases (80.8%) were children aged less than 15 years and 55 cases (19.2%) were adults. The highest proportion of child cases was DHF I (42.9%), whereas that of adults was DHF II (51%). Some clinical manifestations were more common in adult patients, such as petechiae, melena, headache, retro-orbital pain, joint pain, myalgia, nausea and vomiting (p-value<0.05). Signs found commonly in children were epistaxis, oliguria, and liver enlargement (p-value<0.05). Haemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia, increased alanine aminotransferase, and longer prothrombin time were found to be significantly higher in adults than in children (p-value<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Some clinical presentations of dengue disease and laboratory findings in adults are different from those in children. Therefore, adults as well as pediatric cases of DHF need appropriate and prompt case management to reduce the mortality rate of DHF.","['Kittigul, Leera', 'Pitakarnjanakul, Piyamard', 'Sujirarat, Dusit', 'Siripanichgon, Kanokrat']","['Kittigul L', 'Pitakarnjanakul P', 'Sujirarat D', 'Siripanichgon K']",,"['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Public Health, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. phlkt@mahidol.ac.th']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20070515,Netherlands,J Clin Virol,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,9815671,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Severe Dengue/*epidemiology/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Thailand/epidemiology']",,2007/05/18 09:00,2007/07/25 09:00,['2007/05/18 09:00'],"['2006/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2007/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1386-6532(07)00135-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jcv.2007.04.006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Virol. 2007 Jun;39(2):76-81. doi: 10.1016/j.jcv.2007.04.006.

Worldwide, over three hundred million people are infected with dengue virus (DENV) every year as per the World Health Organization (WHO). DENV-mediated disease severity ranges from a mild fever to hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. Patients suffering from severe infection might experience multi-organ failure, cardiomyopathy and even encephalopathy, further complicating the disease pathogenesis. In life-threatening cases, DENV has been reported to affect almost all organs of the human body. In this review, we discuss the organ tropism of DENV in humans in depth as detected in various autopsy studies. Keeping in mind the fact that there is currently no DENV-specific antiviral, it is of utmost importance to achieve a vivid picture of the susceptible cells in humans which might help in designing antivirals against DENV, especially targeting those tissues in which infection might lead to life-threatening conditions.","['Begum, Feroza', 'Das, Sandeepan', 'Mukherjee, Debica', 'Mal, Sweety', 'Ray, Upasana']","['Begum F', 'Das S', 'Mukherjee D', 'Mal S', 'Ray U']",,"['CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4 Raja S.C.

The current WHO classification used since the 70s classifies dengue into dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), dengue shock syndrome (DSS). In 2009, a new classification of dengue proposed by WHO Tropical Disease Research (TDR) was published in the WHO TDR 2009 dengue guidelines. This new classification classifies dengue into dengue (D), dengue with warning signs (DW) and severe dengue (SD). OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness in clinical management between the current WHO classification and the newly suggested classification (TDR) and to assess the 4 criteria of the DHF case definition of the current WHO classification for possible modification. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective study of suspected dengue patients admitted to the Dengue Unit, Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health between June-August 2009 was done. All cases were managed according to the Thai National Dengue Guidelines 2008. The final diagnoses were based on the current WHO Classification together with dengue laboratory confirmation. TDR classification was applied later by the author, using the data from the present study case report forms of each patient. Statistical analysis comparing clinical and laboratory data between each group of patients was done by using SPSS version 14. RESULTS: Total 274 confirmed dengue patients and 24 non-dengue febrile illnesses (ND) were used for analysis. There were 180 DF (65.7%), 53 DHF grade I (19.3%), 19 DHF grade II (6.9%), 19 DHF grade II (6.9%) and 3 DHF grade IV (1.1%) as classified by the current WHO classification while the suggested TDR classified 85 (31%), 160 (58.4%) and 29 (1.1%) as D, DW and SD respectively. At least one of the warning signs were found in 50, 53.3, 83, 88.2, 100 and 100% of ND, DF, DHF grade I, DHF grade II, DHF grade III and DHF grade IV patients. Vomiting and abdominal pain were the 2 most common warning signs found in both ND and dengue patients. Intensive monitoring and careful medical and i.v. fluid management were needed for 94 DHF patients compared to 189 DW and SD patients by the new TDR classification. There were 8 DSS patients who had AST > 1,000U and one patient presented with encephalopathy. These 8 patients cannot be classified properly in the current WHO classification. One non-dengue patient who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding was classified as SD. Bleeding and/or positive tourniquet test was found in and 69.7% of DHF patients. Plasma leakage detected using hemoconcentration, chest x-ray (CXR) and ultrasonography. Hemoconcentration could detect plasma leakage in 44.7% and CXR added up evidence of plasma leakage to 86.3%. Ultrasonography was the most sensitive technique to add evidence of plasma leakage up to 100%. Platelet < or = 100,000 cells/mm3 was found in 93.5% of DHF patients. CONCLUSION: Current WHO classification is recommended for continuing use because the newly suggested TDR classification creates about 2 times the workload to health care personnel. In addition, the TDR classification needs dengue confirmatory tests. More than 90% of DHF defined by WHO case definition are dengue confirmed. However, current WHO classification needs to be modified for more simple and friendly use. The suggested modification is to address plasma leakage as the major criteria. Tourniquet test positive or bleeding symptoms can be considered as minor criteria. Unusual dengue is proposed to be added to the current WHO classification to cover those patients who do not fit with the current WHO classification.","['Kalayanarooj, Siripen']",['Kalayanarooj S'],,"['Dengue Unit, Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health, College of Medicine, Rangsit University, Bangkok, Thailand. siripenk@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,,IM,"['Abdominal Pain/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/*classification/*diagnosis/therapy/virology', 'Dengue Virus/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Patients/statistics & numerical data', 'Prospective Studies', 'Serologic Tests', 'Sex Distribution', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vomiting/etiology', 'World Health Organization']",,2011/11/03 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/11/03 06:00'],"['2011/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2011 Aug;94 Suppl 3:S74-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present surveillance system is unlikely to generate proper information on the epidemiology of the disease, which is essential for planning and development of relevant control/preventive measures against dengue. OBJECTIVE: Between November 2001 and January 2002, a descriptive study was undertaken on children with clinical dengue attending Kanchi Kamakoti Child Trust Hospital (KKCTH, a major private referral pediatric hospital in Tamil Nadu, India) to define the magnitude of dengue burden, the natural history of this disease in terms of clinical presentation, and outcome of the infections in hospitalized children (< 15) with clinical dengue. METHODS: The sera collected from patients analyzed for dengue specific IgM and IgG antibodies by IgM, IgG antibody capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using alternatively two commercial kits. World Health Organization clinical case definition was adopted to categorize the dengue confirmed children. RESULTS: Dengue was diagnosed in 74.5% (143) of the 192 hospitalized children with clinical dengue. A considerable proportion (20%) of the total dengue infections were constituted by infants less than 1 yr of age. DF [dengue fever], DHF [dengue hemorrhagic fever] and DSS [dengue shock syndrome] were diagnosed in 65%, 11.2% and 23.8% of 143 dengue confirmed patients respectively. Though severe dengue (DSS + DHF) was present in 35% of the patients, the mortality rate was low during the study period due to timely diagnosis and clinical management of the patients. CONCLUSION: In developing countries like India, building of laboratory capacity for diagnosis and combat-mode ready preparedness for the management of dengue cases in emergency situation may reduce dengue-related mortality. This can be achieved in a wider scale through an integrated approach through the community, professionals and the public health departments.","['Kabilan, L', 'Balasubramanian, S', 'Keshava, S M', 'Satyanarayana, K']","['Kabilan L', 'Balasubramanian S', 'Keshava SM', 'Satyanarayana K']",,"['Centre for Research in Medical Entomology, Indian Council of Medical Research, Chennai, India. d1crme@sify.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/classification/complications/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Severe Dengue/epidemiology', 'Shock/epidemiology/etiology']",,2006/01/05 09:00,2006/07/13 09:00,['2006/01/05 09:00'],"['2006/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02731664 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2005 Nov;72(11):919-23. doi: 10.1007/BF02731664.,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, more studies are required to quantify the disease burden on different populations, explore the impact of DENV serotype-specific transmission on host-responses and dengue severity and measure the economic impact of dengue on a population.

Three improvements are necessary to standardise the dengue haemorrhagic fever definition and to allow it to do well in different populations: (1) redefine the threshold for thrombocytopenia, (2) clarify the standard practice and value of the tourniquet test, and (3) incorporate a criterion to measure intravenous fluid replacement.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors made a 4-year prospective, observational study of dengue-infected patients admitted to the emergency department of the Fort-de-France University Hospital. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-three male and 297 female patients were included. The median age was 37 years (range: 14-91). The diagnosis was based on a positive RT-PCR (463 patients) or on the presence of specific IgM (97 patients). Two hundred and seventy-seven patients (49.5%) presented with dengue fever without complications. According to WHO criteria, 95 patients (17%) developed plasma leakage, including 39 patients (7%) diagnosed with DHF, and 10 (1.8%) diagnosed with DSS. Among the other patients without plasma leakage, 84 (15%) had isolated thrombocytopenia, 14 (2.5%) had internal bleeding, and 90 (16%) had unusual manifestations. Seven patients died (1.3%): fulminant hepatitis (two), myocarditis (one), encephalitis (one), acute respiratory failure (one), gangrenous cholecystitis (one), and post-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (one). The other patients recovered. Seven patients were pregnant (1.3%) from 6 to 27 weeks of amenorrhea and carried their pregnancy to term without complications.

However, current maps of dengue risk provide estimates of disease burden or the boundaries of endemicity rather than transmission intensity. We therefore developed a global high-resolution map of dengue transmission intensity by fitting environmentally driven geospatial models to geolocated force of infection estimates derived from cross-sectional serological surveys and routine case surveillance data. We assessed the impact of interventions on dengue transmission and disease using Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and the Sanofi-Pasteur vaccine as specific examples. We predicted high transmission intensity in all continents straddling the tropics, with hot spots in South America (Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil), Africa (western and central African countries), and Southeast Asia (Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines). We estimated that 105 [95% confidence interval (CI), 95 to 114] million dengue infections occur each year with 51 (95% CI, 32 to 66) million febrile disease cases. Our analysis suggests that transmission-blocking interventions such as Wolbachia, even at intermediate efficacy (50% transmission reduction), might reduce global annual disease incidence by up to 90%. The Sanofi-Pasteur vaccine, targeting only seropositive recipients, might reduce global annual disease incidence by 20 to 30%, with the greatest impact in high-transmission settings. The transmission intensity map presented here, and made available for download, may help further assessment of the impact of dengue control interventions and prioritization of global public health efforts.","['Cattarino, Lorenzo', 'Rodriguez-Barraquer, Isabel', 'Imai, Natsuko', 'Cummings, Derek A T', 'Ferguson, Neil M']","['Cattarino L', 'Rodriguez-Barraquer I', 'Imai N', 'Cummings DAT', 'Ferguson NM']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3975-550X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6784-1021', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4218-9716', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9437-1907', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1154-8093']","['MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, UK. l.cattarino@imperial.ac.uk.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA.', 'MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, UK.', 'Department of Biology and Emerging Pathogens Institute, University of Florida, P.

To identify the origin of the imported dengue virus, we investigated the interconnectivity via air travel between dengue-endemic countries and Madeira, and compared available sequences against GenBank. There were 22,948 air travellers to Madeira in 2012, originating from twenty-nine dengue-endemic countries; 89.6% of these international travellers originated from Venezuela and Brazil. We developed an importation index that takes into account both travel volume and the extent of dengue incidence in the country of origin. Venezuela and Brazil had by far the highest importation indices compared with all other dengue-endemic countries. The importation index for Venezuela was twice as high as that for Brazil. When taking into account seasonality in the months preceding the onset of the Madeira outbreak, this index was even seven times higher for Venezuela than for Brazil during this time. Dengue sequencing shows that the virus responsible for the Madeira outbreak was most closely related to viruses circulating in Venezuela, Brazil and Columbia. Applying the importation index, Venezuela was identified as the most likely origin of importation of dengue virus via travellers to Madeira. We propose that the importation index is a new additional tool that can help to identify and anticipate the most probable country of origin for importation of dengue into currently non-endemic countries.","['Wilder-Smith, A', 'Quam, M', 'Sessions, O', 'Rocklov, J', 'Liu-Helmersson, J', 'Franco, L', 'Khan, K']","['Wilder-Smith A', 'Quam M', 'Sessions O', 'Rocklov J', 'Liu-Helmersson J', 'Franco L', 'Khan K']",,"['Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Epidemiology and Global Health, Umea University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140227,Sweden,Euro Surveill,Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,100887452,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/transmission/virology', 'Dengue Virus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Disease Outbreaks/*statistics & numerical data', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Portugal/epidemiology', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Travel']",,2014/03/08 06:00,2014/04/30 06:00,['2014/03/08 06:00'],"['2014/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['20718 [pii]', '10.2807/1560-7917.es2014.19.8.20718 [doi]']",epublish,Euro Surveill. 2014 Feb 27;19(8):20718. doi: 10.2807/1560-7917.es2014.19.8.20718.,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Euro Surveill. 2014;19(9):20725'],,,,,,

However, severe dengue can develop rapidly while patients are at home. Understanding the self-care practices and healthcare-seeking behaviours among dengue patients managed as outpatients will help improve the delivery of care to these patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the self-care practices, health-seeking behaviour and outpatient management of dengue fever from the perspectives of patients and primary care physicians. METHODOLOGY: This qualitative study used in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to obtain information from laboratory-confirmed dengue patients who received outpatient care and primary care physicians who cared for them. Patients and physicians shared their experiences and perceptions of self-care practices, decisions to seek urgent care, and outpatient management procedures and visit frequency. Data were coded and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: 13 patients and 11 physicians participated. We discovered that the use of traditional remedies was common with patients perceiving no harm from it, whereas physicians did not see a benefit. Dengue patients' knowledge of warning signs was inadequate despite the information being provided by physicians during clinical follow-up visits. Regarding the decision to seek urgent medical care, physicians assumed patients would seek help immediately once they experienced warning signs. However, for the patients, other factors influenced their health-seeking behaviour, such as their personal perceptions of symptom severity and often more importantly, their social circumstances (e.g., availability of childcare). Patients also described regular outpatient follow-up for dengue as inconvenient. There was variation in the prescribed outpatient follow-up interval recommended by participating physicians who complained about the lack of clear guidelines. CONCLUSION: Perceptions around self-care practices, health-seeking behaviour and outpatient management of dengue often differed between physicians and patients, especially on comprehension of dengue warning signs. Addressing these gaps between patient and physician perceptions and recognition of patient drivers of health-seeking behaviour are needed to improve the safety and delivery of outpatient care for dengue patients.","['Ng, Wei Leik', 'Toh, Jia Yong', 'Ng, Chirk Jenn', 'Teo, Chin Hai', 'Lee, Yew Kong', 'Loo, Kim Kee', 'Abdul Hadi, Haireen', 'Noor Azhar, Abdul Muhaimin']","['Ng WL', 'Toh JY', 'Ng CJ', 'Teo CH', 'Lee YK', 'Loo KK', 'Abdul Hadi H', 'Noor Azhar AM']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3074-9114'],"['Department of Primary Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Primary Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Primary Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Research, SingHealth Polyclinics, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Health Services and Systems Research, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Primary Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'UM eHealth Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Primary Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'UM eHealth Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Primary Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Primary Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20230427,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Humans', 'Self Care', 'Qualitative Research', '*Physicians', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care', '*Dengue/diagnosis/therapy']",PMC10168551,2023/04/27 18:41,2023/05/11 06:42,['2023/04/27 13:53'],"['2022/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2023/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2023/05/11 06:42 [medline]', '2023/04/27 18:41 [pubmed]', '2023/04/27 13:53 [entrez]']","['PNTD-D-22-01181 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0011302 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2023 Apr 27;17(4):e0011302. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0011302. eCollection 2023 Apr.,4,"['Copyright: (c) 2023 Ng et al.

This article uses the concept of 'medical populism' to analyse the political construction of the 2019 dengue epidemics in Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Honduras. Through this framework, we examine the narratives of these outbreaks by reconstructing how political actors simplified the discourse, spectacularised the crises, offered multiple knowledge claims, and forged divisions between the people and 'dangerous others'. Taken together, our case studies, obtained through government, journalistic, and scholarly sources, illuminate the role of medical populists (who are almost always politicians) in defining and responding to public health emergencies, underscoring the performative dimension of disease outbreaks. By detracting attention from less spectacular but more substantive policies and programs, these 'performances' of health crises perpetuate health inequities, especially in fragile democracies like the aforementioned Global South countries. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of medical populism to public health, health communications, and the inevitable recurrence of epidemics.","['Lasco, Gideon', 'Gregory Yu, Vincen']","['Lasco G', 'Gregory Yu V']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6402-682X'],"['Development Studies Program, Ateneo de Manila University, Quezon City, Philippines.', 'Department of Anthropology, University of the Philippines Diliman, Quezon City, Philippines.', 'Development Studies Program, Ateneo de Manila University, Quezon City, Philippines.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210810,England,Glob Public Health,Global public health,101256323,,IM,"['*Dengue/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Disease Outbreaks', '*Epidemics', 'Humans', 'Politics', 'Public Health']",,2021/08/11 06:00,2022/09/01 06:00,['2021/08/10 17:12'],"['2021/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/10 17:12 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17441692.2021.1965181 [doi]'],ppublish,Glob Public Health. 2022 Aug-Sep;17(9):1795-1808. doi: 10.1080/17441692.2021.1965181.

METHODS: We analyzed the clinical characteristics of 110 patients infected with dengue virus; data were collected on standardized data collection sheets at two tertiary care hospitals from September to December 2008. Dengue infection was confirmed serologically or by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Out of the total of 110 dengue infected patients, 70 were male and 40 were female. The most common symptoms included fever (100%), myalgia (68.2%), headache (55.5%), nausea (39.1%), skin rash (53.6%), mucocutaneous hemorrhagic manifestations (58.2%), and ocular pain (20%). Classic dengue fever (DF) was seen in 41.8% of the patients, 56.4% had dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and only 1.8% developed dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The mean duration of fever was 6 days. Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and abnormal aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were more frequently encountered in DHF and DSS as compared to DF. Viral RNA detection was done by RT-PCR in 17 patients. Ten patients had DEN4, five had DEN2, and two had DEN3 serotypes. The majority of the patients recovered completely without complications. CONCLUSION: The high frequency of DHF during the 2008 outbreak and the presence of three different dengue serotypes, emphasize the need to prevent and control dengue infection. Health authorities should consider strengthening surveillance for dengue infection, given the potential for future outbreaks with increased severity. It is also suggested that primary care physicians should be educated regarding recognition of DHF and to identify patients at high risk of developing DHF and DSS.","['Humayoun, Malik Asif', 'Waseem, Tariq', 'Jawa, Ali A', 'Hashmi, Mubashar S', 'Akram, Javed']","['Humayoun MA', 'Waseem T', 'Jawa AA', 'Hashmi MS', 'Akram J']",,"['Department of Medicine, Allama Iqbal Medical College and Jinnah Hospital, Maulana Shabbir Ahmed Usmani Road, Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. doctormalikasif@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100219,Canada,Int J Infect Dis,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,9610933,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*classification/isolation & purification', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pakistan/epidemiology', 'Serotyping', 'Severe Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Young Adult']",,2010/02/23 06:00,2011/02/22 06:00,['2010/02/23 06:00'],"['2009/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S1201-9712(10)00018-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijid.2009.10.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Infect Dis. 2010 Sep;14 Suppl 3:e54-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ijid.2009.10.008.

The initial clinical manifestation of dengue often is confused with other febrile states confounding both clinical management and disease surveillance. Evidence-based triage strategies that identify individuals likely to be in the early stages of dengue illness can direct patient stratification for clinical investigations, management, and virological surveillance. Here we report the identification of algorithms that differentiate dengue from other febrile illnesses in the primary care setting and predict severe disease in adults. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 1,200 patients presenting in the first 72 hours of acute febrile illness were recruited and followed up for up to a 4-week period prospectively; 1,012 of these were recruited from Singapore and 188 from Vietnam. Of these, 364 were dengue RT-PCR positive; 173 had dengue fever, 171 had dengue hemorrhagic fever, and 20 had dengue shock syndrome as final diagnosis. Using a C4.5 decision tree classifier for analysis of all clinical, haematological, and virological data, we obtained a diagnostic algorithm that differentiates dengue from non-dengue febrile illness with an accuracy of 84.7%. The algorithm can be used differently in different disease prevalence to yield clinically useful positive and negative predictive values. Furthermore, an algorithm using platelet count, crossover threshold value of a real-time RT-PCR for dengue viral RNA, and presence of pre-existing anti-dengue IgG antibodies in sequential order identified cases with sensitivity and specificity of 78.2% and 80.2%, respectively, that eventually developed thrombocytopenia of 50,000 platelet/mm(3) or less, a level previously shown to be associated with haemorrhage and shock in adults with dengue fever. CONCLUSION: This study shows a proof-of-concept that decision algorithms using simple clinical and haematological parameters can predict diagnosis and prognosis of dengue disease, a finding that could prove useful in disease management and surveillance.","['Tanner, Lukas', 'Schreiber, Mark', 'Low, Jenny G H', 'Ong, Adrian', 'Tolfvenstam, Thomas', 'Lai, Yee Ling', 'Ng, Lee Ching', 'Leo, Yee Sin', 'Thi Puong, Le', 'Vasudevan, Subhash G', 'Simmons, Cameron P', 'Hibberd, Martin L', 'Ooi, Eng Eong']","['Tanner L', 'Schreiber M', 'Low JG', 'Ong A', 'Tolfvenstam T', 'Lai YL', 'Ng LC', 'Leo YS', 'Thi Puong L', 'Vasudevan SG', 'Simmons CP', 'Hibberd ML', 'Ooi EE']",,"['Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080312,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Algorithms', '*Decision Trees', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/pathology/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/genetics', 'Humans', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Severe Dengue/diagnosis/pathology/virology', 'Young Adult']",PMC2263124,2008/03/13 09:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2008/03/13 09:00'],"['2007/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2008/03/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['07-PNTD-RA-0116R2 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0000196 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2008 Mar 12;2(3):e196. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000196.,3,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,['074636/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To the best of our knowledge, this case is the first documented case of coinfection with dengue virus and hantavirus in Central America.","['Nunez-Samudio, Virginia', 'Meza, Martin', 'Landires, Ivan']","['Nunez-Samudio V', 'Meza M', 'Landires I']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6323-1170'],"['Instituto de Ciencias Medicas, Las Tablas, Los Santos, Panama.', 'Seccion de Epidemiologia, Departamento de Salud Publica, Region de Salud de Herrera, Ministry of Health, Chitre, Herrera, Panama.', 'Seccion de Epidemiologia, Departamento de Salud Publica, Region de Salud de Herrera, Ministry of Health, Chitre, Herrera, Panama.', 'Instituto de Ciencias Medicas, Las Tablas, Los Santos, Panama ilandires@institutodecienciasmedicas.org.', 'Centro Regional Universitario de Azuero, CRUA, Universidad de Panama, Chitre, Herrera, Panama.', 'Hospital Joaquin Pablo Franco Sayas, Region de Salud de Los Santos, Ministry of Health, Las Tablas, Los Santos, Panama.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210519,England,BMJ Case Rep,BMJ case reports,101526291,,IM,"['*Coinfection', '*Dengue/complications/diagnosis', '*Orthohantavirus', '*Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Panama']",PMC8137157,2021/05/21 06:00,2021/05/22 06:00,['2021/05/20 05:48'],"['2021/05/20 05:48 [entrez]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/22 06:00 [medline]']","['14/5/e235779 [pii]', 'bcr-2020-235779 [pii]', '10.1136/bcr-2020-235779 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Case Rep. 2021 May 19;14(5):e235779. doi: 10.1136/bcr-2020-235779.,5,"['(c) BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2021.

Evaluations of the burden and severity of dengue disease have been hindered by the frequent lack of laboratory confirmation and strong selection bias toward more severe cases. METHODOLOGY: A multinational, prospective clinical study was carried out in South-East Asia (SEA) and Latin America (LA), to ascertain the proportion of inapparent dengue infections in households of febrile dengue cases, and to compare clinical data and biological markers from subjects with various dengue disease patterns. Dengue infection was laboratory-confirmed during the acute phase, by virus isolation and detection of the genome. The four participating reference laboratories used standardized methods. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among 215 febrile dengue subjects-114 in SEA and 101 in LA-28 (13.0%) were diagnosed with severe dengue (from SEA only) using the WHO definition. Household investigations were carried out for 177 febrile subjects. Among household members at the time of the first home visit, 39 acute dengue infections were detected of which 29 were inapparent. A further 62 dengue cases were classified at early convalescent phase. Therefore, 101 dengue infections were found among the 408 household members. Adding these together with the 177 Dengue Index Cases, the overall proportion of dengue infections among the study participants was estimated at 47.5% (278/585; 95% CI 43.5-51.6). Lymphocyte counts and detection of the NS1 antigen differed significantly between inapparent and symptomatic dengue subjects; among inapparent cases lymphocyte counts were normal and only 20% were positive for NS1 antigen. Primary dengue infection and a specific dengue virus serotype were not associated with symptomatic dengue infection. CONCLUSION: Household investigation demonstrated a high proportion of household members positive for dengue infection, including a number of inapparent cases, the frequency of which was higher in SEA than in LA.","['Dussart, Philippe', 'Baril, Laurence', 'Petit, Laure', 'Beniguel, Lydie', 'Quang, Luong Chan', 'Ly, Sowath', 'Azevedo, Raimunda do Socorro Silva', 'Meynard, Jean-Baptiste', 'Vong, Sirenda', 'Chartier, Loic', 'Diop, Aba', 'Sivuth, Ong', 'Duong, Veasna', 'Thang, Cao Minh', 'Jacobs, Michael', 'Sakuntabhai, Anavaj', 'Nunes, Marcio Roberto Teixeira', 'Huong, Vu Ti Que', 'Buchy, Philippe', 'Vasconcelos, Pedro Fernando da Costa']","['Dussart P', 'Baril L', 'Petit L', 'Beniguel L', 'Quang LC', 'Ly S', 'Azevedo Rdo S', 'Meynard JB', 'Vong S', 'Chartier L', 'Diop A', 'Sivuth O', 'Duong V', 'Thang CM', 'Jacobs M', 'Sakuntabhai A', 'Nunes MR', 'Huong VT', 'Buchy P', 'Vasconcelos PF']",,"['Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, Laboratoire de Virologie, Cayenne, French Guiana. pdussart@pasteur-cayenne.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120124,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asia, Southeastern/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*pathology/transmission/virology', 'Dengue Virus', 'Family Characteristics', '*Family Health', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Internationality', 'Latin America/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies']",PMC3265457,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/05/17 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['PNTD-D-11-00013 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0001482 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2012 Jan;6(1):e1482. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001482.

Histopathologic features and immunohistochemistry may have poor sensitivity and serotype determination is not always possible. Viral RNA genome detection tests are faster and considered the most sensitive technique for this kind of analysis, however, the use of molecular methods applied to FFPE tissues is still limited. The authors applied a single-step multiplex reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the investigation of DENV infection and typing to FFPE samples of 32 fatal cases received during the 2019 outbreak that occurred in Sao Paulo state, Brazil. The authors compared the results with those obtained using FF tissues. Of the 24 cases with both FF and FFPE samples, 22 (91.67%) of the FF and 19 (76.20%) of the FFPE specimens were positive. Two cases (8.33%) tested negative in both types of samples. All 8 cases with only FFPE samples available were positive. The accuracy (87.5%) of the RT-qPCR for DENV in FFPE samples were satisfactory. Although the cycle quantification (Cq) values were significantly higher in these materials (P<0.0001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) when compared with FF tissues, Spearman's rank coefficient indicated a good correlation between the Cq values from both sample types (P=0.0063; rho=0.576). RT-qPCR applied to FFPE samples improved detection of DENV in fatal cases and represents a useful tool for diagnosis and epidemiologic studies.","['Mariotti Guerra, Juliana', 'Santos da Silva Ferreira, Camila', 'Rosa Fernandes Beraldo, Karolina', 'Midori Kimura, Lidia', 'Possatto Fernandes Takahashi, Juliana', 'Salas-Gomez, David', 'Sequetin Cunha, Mariana', 'Fletcher Buss, Lewis', 'Silva Nogueira, Juliana', 'Yurika Maeda, Adriana', 'Jose Tadeu de Araujo, Leonardo']","['Mariotti Guerra J', 'Santos da Silva Ferreira C', 'Rosa Fernandes Beraldo K', 'Midori Kimura L', 'Possatto Fernandes Takahashi J', 'Salas-Gomez D', 'Sequetin Cunha M', 'Fletcher Buss L', 'Silva Nogueira J', 'Yurika Maeda A', 'Jose Tadeu de Araujo L']",,"['Pathology Center.', 'Pathology Center.', 'Pathology Center.', 'Central Laboratory, Federal University of Sao Paulo.', 'Pathology Center.', 'Pathology Center.', 'Pathology Center.', 'Virology Center, Adolfo Lutz Institute.', 'Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Sao Paulo Medical School USP, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Virology Center, Adolfo Lutz Institute.', 'Virology Center, Adolfo Lutz Institute.', 'Pathology Center.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,,IM,"['Brazil/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Dengue/diagnosis/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Dengue Virus/*genetics', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Paraffin Embedding', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2020/08/29 06:00,2021/10/30 06:00,['2020/08/29 06:00'],"['2020/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['00129039-202102000-00012 [pii]', '10.1097/PAI.0000000000000870 [doi]']",ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2021 Feb 1;29(2):158-162. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000870.,2,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The dengue virus is a single-stranded RNA virus with four major serotypes. Infection with one serotype confers homotypic immunity but not heterologous immunity, and secondary infection with another serotype may lead to more severe disease. The major route of transmission occurs through the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector, but dengue has also been transmitted through blood transfusion and organ transplantation. Infection results in a spectrum of clinical illness ranging from asymptomatic infection, undifferentiated fever, dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) to dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Dengue is spreading rapidly to new areas and with increasing frequency of major outbreaks. A trend has also been observed towards increasing age among infected patients. This will impact blood supply availability as more blood donors are deferred because of dengue infection or exposure to infection. The risk of transmission through transfusion of blood from asymptomatic viraemic donors will also increase. Although screening tests for dengue and effective pathogen reduction processes are now available for the blood supply, the value of implementing these costly measures needs to be carefully considered. Demand for platelets and fresh frozen plasma will rise with increasing number of DHF/DSS. Evidence-based guidelines for the clinical use of these blood components in the management of patients with DHF/DSS have not been well established, and inappropriate use will contribute to the challenges faced by blood services.","['Teo, D', 'Ng, L C', 'Lam, S']","['Teo D', 'Ng LC', 'Lam S']",,"['Blood Services Group, Health Sciences Authority, Singapore, Singapore.

Dengue haemagglutination-inhibition antibody titres of 80 or less had little effect on viraemia, but antibody titres of 160 or greater were associated with a decrease in virus isolation rate and in virus titre. The duration and magnitude of viraemia did not vary significantly with the severity of the disease and was only slightly higher in patients classified as primary dengue infections than in those classified as secondary infections. Measurement of viraemia in fatal dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases showed that these patients had significant quantities of circulating virus at the time of death.","['Gubler, D J', 'Suharyono, W', 'Tan, R', 'Abidin, M', 'Sie, A']","['Gubler DJ', 'Suharyono W', 'Tan R', 'Abidin M', 'Sie A']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Bull World Health Organ,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,7507052,,IM,"['Dengue/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests', 'Humans', 'Indonesia', 'Viremia/*diagnosis']",PMC2396101,1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull World Health Organ. 1981;59(4):623-30.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first dengue virus vaccine, Dengvaxia, now licensed in 20 endemic countries, the EU and the USA, provides protection against severe dengue in seropositive individuals but increases the risk for naive recipients to develop severe dengue and to be hospitalised. We discuss mechanisms and implications of shortcomings of the licensed vaccine and describe the structure and attributes of two other dengue virus vaccines. Based upon human dengue challenge studies, one of these vaccines promises to deliver solid, long-lasting immunity after a single dose.

However, data for Mexico are limited. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Burden of dengue fever (DF) and DHF in Mexico was assessed using official databases for epidemiological information, disabilities weights from Shepard et al, the reported number of cases and deaths, and costs. Overall costs of dengue were summed from direct medical costs to the health system, cost of dengue to the patient (out-of-pocket expenses [medical and non-medical], indirect costs [loss of earnings, patient and/or caregiver]), and other government expenditures on prevention/surveillance. The first three components, calculated as costs per case by a micro-costing approach (PAATI; program, actions, activities, tasks, inputs), were scaled up to overall cost using epidemiology data from official databases. PAATI was used to calculate cost of vector control and prevention, education, and epidemiological surveillance, based on an expert consensus and normative construction of an ideal scenario. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for Mexico in 2016 were calculated to be 2283.46 (1.87 per 100,000 inhabitants). Overall economic impact of dengue in Mexico for 2012 was US$144 million, of which US$44 million corresponded to direct medical costs and US$5 million to the costs from the patient's perspective. The estimated cost of prevention/surveillance was calculated with information provided by federal government to be US$95 million. The overall economic impact of DF and DHF showed an increase in 2013 to US$161 million and a decrease to US$133, US$131 and US$130 million in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The medical and economic impact of dengue were in agreement with other international studies, and highlight the need to include governmental expenditure for prevention/surveillance in overall cost analyses given the high economic impact of these, increasing the necessity to evaluate its effectiveness.","['Zubieta-Zavala, Adriana', 'Lopez-Cervantes, Malaquias', 'Salinas-Escudero, Guillermo', 'Ramirez-Chavez, Adrian', 'Castaneda, Jose Ramos', 'Hernandez-Gaytan, Sendy Isarel', 'Lopez Yescas, Juan Guillermo', 'Duran-Arenas, Luis']","['Zubieta-Zavala A', 'Lopez-Cervantes M', 'Salinas-Escudero G', 'Ramirez-Chavez A', 'Castaneda JR', 'Hernandez-Gaytan SI', 'Lopez Yescas JG', 'Duran-Arenas L']",,"['Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', ""Center for Economic Studies and Social Health, Children's Hospital of Mexico Federico Gomez, Ministry of Health, Mexico City, Mexico."", 'Private Practice, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Arbovirus, National Institute of Public Health, Cuernavaca, Mexico.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Medical Affairs, Sanofi Pasteur Latin America, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181214,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/*economics/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Disabled Persons', 'Government Programs', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Severe Dengue/*economics/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Young Adult']",PMC6310288,2018/12/15 06:00,2019/02/05 06:00,['2018/12/15 06:00'],"['2017/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['PNTD-D-17-01373 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0006938 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2018 Dec 14;12(12):e0006938. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006938. eCollection 2018 Dec.,12,,,,"[""I have read the journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript have the"", 'following competing interests: JRC is member of the Scientific Advisory Board on', 'Dengue Vaccine from Sanofi Pasteur and has received honoraria for their', 'participation.

It is believed that this behaviour arises from the interplay between environmental drivers and serotype interactions. The exact mechanism, however, is uncertain. Constraining mathematical models to patterns characteristic to dengue epidemiology offers a means for detecting such mechanisms. Here, we used a pattern-oriented modelling (POM) strategy to fit and assess a range of dengue models, driven by combinations of temporary cross protective-immunity, cross-enhancement, and seasonal forcing, on their ability to capture the main characteristics of dengue dynamics. We show that all proposed models reproduce the observed dengue patterns across some part of the parameter space. Which model best supports the dengue dynamics is determined by the level of seasonal forcing. Further, when tertiary and quaternary infections are allowed, the inclusion of temporary cross-immunity alone is strongly supported, but the addition of cross-enhancement markedly reduces the parameter range at which dengue dynamics are produced, irrespective of the strength of seasonal forcing. The implication of these structural uncertainties on predicted vulnerability to control is also discussed. With ever expanding spread of dengue, greater understanding of dengue dynamics and control efforts (e.g. a near-future vaccine introduction) has become critically important. This study highlights the capacity of multi-level pattern-matching modelling approaches to offer an analytic tool for deeper insights into dengue epidemiology and control.","['Ten Bosch, Quirine A', 'Singh, Brajendra K', 'Hassan, Muhammad R A', 'Chadee, Dave D', 'Michael, Edwin']","['Ten Bosch QA', 'Singh BK', 'Hassan MR', 'Chadee DD', 'Michael E']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5847-8750'],"['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah, Alor Setar, Kedah, Malaysia.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of the West Indies, Saint Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160509,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Computer Simulation', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Dengue Virus/*classification', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', '*Pattern Recognition, Automated', '*Seasons', 'Serogroup', 'Trinidad and Tobago/epidemiology']",PMC4861330,2016/05/10 06:00,2017/03/31 06:00,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2015/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['PNTD-D-15-01168 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0004680 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2016 May 9;10(5):e0004680. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004680. eCollection 2016 May.,5,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On December 9th, 2015, Mexico became the first country for which the dengue vaccine was approved for use. In anticipation of a vaccine rollout, analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the dengue vaccination program that quantifies the dynamics of disease transmission is essential. METHODS: We developed a dynamic transmission model of dengue in Yucatan, Mexico and its proposed vaccination program to incorporate herd immunity into our analysis of cost-effectiveness analysis. Our model also incorporates important characteristics of dengue epidemiology, such as clinical cross-immunity and susceptibility enhancement upon secondary infection. Using our model, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness and economic impact of an imperfect dengue vaccine in Yucatan, Mexico. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that a dengue vaccination program would prevent 90% of cases of symptomatic DF incidence as well as 90% of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) incidence and dengue-related deaths annually. We conclude that a dengue vaccine program in Yucatan, Mexico would be very cost-effective as long as the vaccination cost per individual is less than $140 and $214 from health care and societal perspectives, respectively. Furthermore, at an exemplary vaccination cost of $250 USD per individual on average, dengue vaccination is likely to be cost-effective 43% and 88% of the time from health care and societal perspectives, respectively.","['Shim, Eunha']",['Shim E'],,"['Department of Mathematics, Soongsil University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170405,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Dengue Vaccines)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Dengue/economics/epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission', 'Dengue Vaccines/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Costs/statistics & numerical data', 'Health Care Costs/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Young Adult']",PMC5381893,2017/04/06 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2016/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-16-06852 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0175020 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Apr 5;12(4):e0175020. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0175020. eCollection 2017.,4,,,,['Competing Interests: The author has declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It causes a disease that manifests as a spectrum of clinical symptoms, including dengue hemorrhagic fever. DV is proficient at diverting the immune system to facilitate transmission through its vector host, Aedes spp. mosquito. Similar to other vector-borne parasites, dengue may also require a second structural form, a virus of alternative morphology (VAM), to complete its life cycle. DV can replicate to high copy numbers in patient plasma, but no classical viral particles can be detected by ultra-structural microscopy analysis. A VAM appearing as a microparticle has been recapitulated with in vitro cell lines Meg01 and K562, close relatives to the cells harboring dengue virus in vivo. VAMs are likely to contribute to the high viremia levels observed in dengue patients. This review discusses the possible existence of a VAM in the DV life cycle.","['Bargeron Clark, Kristina', 'Hsiao, Hui-Mien', 'Noisakran, Sansanee', 'Tsai, Jih-Jin', 'Perng, Guey Chuen']","['Bargeron Clark K', 'Hsiao HM', 'Noisakran S', 'Tsai JJ', 'Perng GC']",,"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120329,United States,Yale J Biol Med,The Yale journal of biology and medicine,0417414,['0 (Dengue Vaccines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/*metabolism', 'Dengue/immunology/*therapy/transmission/*virology', 'Dengue Vaccines/immunology', 'Dengue Virus/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Disease Vectors', 'Drug Design', 'Humans']",PMC3313537,2012/03/31 06:00,2012/08/11 06:00,['2012/03/31 06:00'],"['2012/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/11 06:00 [medline]']",['yjbm8513 [pii]'],ppublish,Yale J Biol Med. 2012 Mar;85(1):3-18.

Recent advances suggest that the scientific world is moving closer to an effective dengue vaccine. However, there are concerns that the price of a future vaccine could limit its uptake. High prices, in addition to other challenges, have already weighed negatively in government decisions to include other new vaccines in national immunization programs, e.g., the pneumococcal, rotavirus, and human papillomavirus vaccines. Recent research on the value of vaccination, however, suggests that vaccination confers benefits that are often neglected by traditional economic evaluations. In the case of dengue, commonly overlooked benefits are likely to include reduced spending on outbreak control, averted losses in tourism flows, and avoided productivity losses due to long-term dengue sequelae. Accounting for these and other broader benefits of dengue vaccination could reveal significantly greater economic value and strengthen the case for inclusion of dengue vaccination in national immunization programs. In this article we discuss a framework for the broader value of vaccination and review its application in the context of dengue vaccination for Brazil.","['Barnighausen, Till', 'Bloom, David E', 'Cafiero, Elizabeth T', ""O'Brien, Jennifer C""]","['Barnighausen T', 'Bloom DE', 'Cafiero ET', ""O'Brien JC""]",,"['Harvard School of Public Health, Department of Global Health and Population, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130722,England,Semin Immunol,Seminars in immunology,9009458,['0 (Dengue Vaccines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Brazil', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Dengue/epidemiology/*prevention & control', '*Dengue Vaccines', 'Humans', 'Quality Improvement']",,2013/07/28 06:00,2014/04/01 06:00,['2013/07/27 06:00'],"['2013/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1044-5323(13)00026-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.smim.2013.04.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Immunol. 2013 Apr;25(2):104-13. doi: 10.1016/j.smim.2013.04.010.

METHOD: Children and adolescents with serologically confirmed dengue infection admitted at Ramathibodi Hospital from 2004 to 2018 and treated by an expert multidisciplinary team were recruited. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed and 14 items, related to clinical parameters and managements during hospitalization, were obtained daily as dengue severity score. RESULTS: A total of 191 patients with a mean age of 10.7 years from 2004 to 2013 were recruited. They were classified as dengue fever (35), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) I (53), II (50), III (37) and IV (16). The analysis of 593 daily records revealed the range of daily severity score among patients with DHF grades III (10-20) and IV (31-47) were significantly higher than those of other groups (dengue fever, 5-13; DHF I, 2-10; DHF II, 6-11) with P-values of 0.0001. Using a validity test, a total daily score of >/=12 was an assessment tool for dengue shock syndrome with sensitivity, 86% and specificity, 84%. An additional 51 hospitalized patients with DHF grades II, III and IV with similar ages from 2014 to 2018 were recruited. The number of patients with severe manifestations, having daily score of >/=12, was significantly higher than those without severe manifestations starting from Day -3 to Day +1 of illness. CONCLUSIONS: Daily dengue severity score of >/=12 was an accurate assessment tool for severe manifestations.","['Tangnararatchakit, Kanchana', 'Chuansumrit, Ampaiwan', 'Watcharakuldilok, Piangor', 'Apiwattanakul, Nopporn', 'Lertbunrian, Rojjanee', 'Keatkla, Jiraporn', 'Yoksan, Sutee']","['Tangnararatchakit K', 'Chuansumrit A', 'Watcharakuldilok P', 'Apiwattanakul N', 'Lertbunrian R', 'Keatkla J', 'Yoksan S']",,"['From the Department of Pediatrics, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'From the Department of Pediatrics, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Buriram Hospital, Buriram, Thailand.', 'From the Department of Pediatrics, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'From the Department of Pediatrics, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Center for Vaccine Development, Institute of Molecular Biosciences, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/mortality/virology', '*Dengue Virus', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Symptom Assessment', 'Time Factors']",,2019/11/15 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2019/11/15 06:00'],"['2019/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['00006454-202003000-00002 [pii]', '10.1097/INF.0000000000002533 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2020 Mar;39(3):184-187. doi: 10.1097/INF.0000000000002533.,3,,,,,['Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2020 Mar;39(3):e28.

Dengue virus show a highly tropism for endothelial reticulum system as the bone marrow, spleen, liver and lymph nodes where viral antigens can be demonstrated by several immunological methods. The pathogenesis of the DHF/DSS can be considered to result from a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction where antigen-activated T lymphocytes release a variety of biologically active chemical mediators (lymphokines) with further effects on blood clotting system and vascular permeability producing the symptoms of shock and hemorrhage seen in these cases.

This was the first outbreak of autochthonous transmission of dengue in Florida since 1934. In response to this outbreak, a multifaceted public education outreach campaign was launched. The aim of this study is to compare dengue prevention knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and prevention practices among residents of subsidized public housing to the general population in Key West and to assess whether there were barriers preventing effective outreach from reaching specific vulnerable populations. METHODS: A randomized population-based evaluation of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors toward dengue prevention consisting of 521 separate household interviews was undertaken in July of 2011. A subset analysis was performed on interviews collected from 28 public housing units within four subsidized public housing complexes. Analysis was performed to determine whether knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors exhibited by public housing residents differed from the non-public housing study population. RESULTS: Public housing residents recalled fewer outreach materials (p=0.01) and were 3.4 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-8.3) more likely not to recall any outreach materials. Public housing residents were less likely to correctly identify how dengue transmission occurs (61% vs. 89%), where mosquitoes lay their eggs (54% vs. 85%), or to identify any signs or symptoms related to dengue (36% vs. 64%). Public housing residents were less likely to perform dengue prevention practices such as removing standing water or always using air conditioning. CONCLUSIONS: Examination of public housing residents identified an at-risk population that recalled less exposure to outreach materials and had less knowledge about dengue infection and prevention than the randomized study population. This provides public health systems the opportunity to target or modify future health messages and interventions to this group. Differences identified in the demographics of this population suggest that alternative methods or non-English materials may be required to reach desired outcomes.","['Matthias, James', 'Zielinski-Gutierrez, Emily C', 'Tisch, Daniel J', 'Stanek, Danielle', 'Blanton, Ronald E', 'Doyle, Michael S', 'Eadie, Robert B', 'Gazdick, Elizabeth J', 'Leal, Andrea L', 'Pattison, Kimberly J', 'Perez-Guerra, Carmen L', 'Tittel, Christopher J', 'Vyas, Jooi', 'Wagner, Todd', 'Blackmore, Carina G M']","['Matthias J', 'Zielinski-Gutierrez EC', 'Tisch DJ', 'Stanek D', 'Blanton RE', 'Doyle MS', 'Eadie RB', 'Gazdick EJ', 'Leal AL', 'Pattison KJ', 'Perez-Guerra CL', 'Tittel CJ', 'Vyas J', 'Wagner T', 'Blackmore CG']",,"['1 Florida Department of Health , Tallahassee, Florida.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)",100965525,,IM,"['Demography', 'Dengue/epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Florida/epidemiology', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Public Housing', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,2014/11/20 06:00,2017/02/06 06:00,['2014/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/vbz.2014.1664 [doi]'],ppublish,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2014 Nov;14(11):788-93. doi: 10.1089/vbz.2014.1664.,11,,['NOTNLM'],"['Dengue', 'Health education', 'Key West', 'Outreach', 'Public housing']",,,['5U38HM000414/HM/NCHM CDC HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most recently, an outbreak occurred in Texas. Though usually a nonspecific febrile illness that resolves with supportive therapy, the clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic to severe hemorrhage and sudden fatal shock. The potential exists for the introduction of dengue virus into other parts of the United States, and for secondary transmission in areas with vector mosquitoes, because of increased travel to and from regions of the Americas where dengue is endemic. The discovery of Aedes (Ae) albopictus strains adapted to temperate conditions makes this threat much greater. With global warming, a more rapid distribution of the Aedes species may occur, moving northward, encompassing larger population centers and leading to increased vectorborne diseases. Control of dengue currently requires control of the principal vector mosquitoes. Vaccine development continues, but at present the only way to avoid dengue in an area where it is endemic or epidemic is to use repellents and mosquito barriers. Lifesaving intervention and management of a patient with dengue and its complications depend upon a complete history, to include travel and physical examination with a high level of suspicion. Physicians and other health care providers should learn to recognize this disease. Once a person is infected, the key to survival is early diagnosis and appropriate treatment for the severe, life-threatening complications of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome.","['Rodriguez-Tan, R S', 'Weir, M R']","['Rodriguez-Tan RS', 'Weir MR']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Scott & White Clinic and Memorial Hospital, Temple, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Tex Med,Texas medicine,0051012,,IM,"['Aedes/virology', 'Animals', 'Dengue/diagnosis/prevention & control/*transmission', 'Disease Outbreaks/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Mosquito Control', 'Texas']",,1998/10/24 00:00,1998/10/24 00:01,['1998/10/24 00:00'],"['1998/10/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tex Med. 1998 Oct;94(10):53-9.,10,,,,,,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was conducted at the local hospital in Piedecuesta, Santander, Colombia, based on comparison of two periods (18 weeks each), before and after use of the algorithm. This included recommendations for clinical diagnosis of dengue and the planning of follow-up visits and hemograms, as well as criteria for hospitalization and the discontinuation of follow-up. Hospitalization rates in the two periods were compared using the Poisson analysis. The population analyzed consisted of patients seen in the facility for acute febrile syndrome. For adjustment purposes, the number of dengue cases (IgM positive) identified in the municipality was included. RESULTS: Information was obtained on 964 patients in the first period and 1350 patients in the second. There were 44 and 13 hospitalizations during the respective periods. Use of the algorithm was associated with a significant reduction in the hospitalization rate (ratio: 0.21; 95% confidence interval; 0.11-0.39). This association did not change when adjusted for the number of dengue cases identified in the city. There were no significant differences in the rate of follow-up visits (P = 0.85) and hemograms (P = 0.24) in the two periods. There were no case fatalities. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that health care resources for dengue management can be optimized with the use of the algorithm.","['Diaz-Quijano, Fredi Alexander', 'Villar-Centeno, Luis Angel', 'Martinez-Vega, Ruth Arali']","['Diaz-Quijano FA', 'Villar-Centeno LA', 'Martinez-Vega RA']",,"['Centro de Investigaciones Epidemiologicas, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia. frediazq@msn.com']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Rev Panam Salud Publica,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,9705400,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Child', 'Colombia', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male']",,2011/11/10 06:00,2012/03/10 06:00,['2011/11/10 06:00'],"['2010/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1020-49892011000900009 [pii]', '10.1590/s1020-49892011000900009 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Panam Salud Publica. 2011 Sep;30(3):248-54. doi: 10.1590/s1020-49892011000900009.,3,,,,,,,,,Reduccion de la hospitalizacion mediante un algoritmo de manejo del dengue en Colombia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not only does this show how inclusion of waning immunity into classical models can reveal important facets of the immune response to natural dengue virus infection, it also has significant ramifications for vaccine development and implementation in dengue endemic areas.","['Lopez, Leonardo', 'Paul, Richard E', 'Cao-Lormeau, Van-Mai', 'Rodo, Xavier']","['Lopez L', 'Paul RE', 'Cao-Lormeau VM', 'Rodo X']",,"['CLIMA (Climate and Health) Program, ISGlobal, c/Dr. Aiguader 88, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.

A retrospective analysis of clinical and laboratory features.,476-9,,"INTRODUCTION: Approximately 80 percent of all notified cases of dengue infections in Singapore were hospitalised from 2000 to 2005. We aimed to determine if hospitalised dengue patients had significant morbidity and mortality, and if admissions were in accordance with previously-published admission criteria. METHODS: The medical records of the first 20 patients with laboratory-confirmed dengue from two consecutive months in three time periods were retrospectively reviewed. Demographical, clinical and laboratory data on admission, during hospitalisation and on discharge, were compared. RESULTS: There were 120 patients with a mean age of 35 years. Males comprised 77 percent and foreign workers 51 percent. Of the published admission criteria, 33 percent had vomiting, 22 percent diarrhoea, 13 percent abdominal pain, 18 percent bleeding and one patient had hypotension. 30 percent were above the minimum platelet threshold of 80,000/microL, but 50 percent had safe levels of platelets between 50,000 and 80,000/microL. Dengue haemorrhagic fever occurred in 4 percent with no death. After admission, platelet nadir was below 20,000/microL in only 9 percent and below 10,000/microL in only 2 percent of cases. Bleeding did not correlate with platelet count. Medical referral to the hospital was significantly associated with thrombocytopenia, while self-referral was significantly associated with vomiting. CONCLUSION: Severe adverse outcome among young adults with uncomplicated dengue fever is rare. Instead of hospitalisation, daily outpatient monitoring with symptomatic treatment and medical leave may be a safe and feasible alternative.","['Lye, D C', 'Chan, M', 'Lee, V J', 'Leo, Y S']","['Lye DC', 'Chan M', 'Lee VJ', 'Leo YS']",,"['Department of Infectious Diseases, Communicable Disease Centre, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. david_lye@ttsh.com.sg']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Singapore Med J,Singapore medical journal,0404516,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Female', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2008/06/27 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/06/27 09:00'],"['2008/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Singapore Med J. 2008 Jun;49(6):476-9.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, it describes the most common symptoms associated with classical dengue and hemorrhagic dengue and presents data on the distribution of the epidemic in the various comprehensive local health care systems of Nicaragua. The study group consisted of 39 patients hospitalized in Managua and Leon for dengue with hemorrhagic manifestations and hemorrhagic dengue. Of these patients, 34 were classified as probable or confirmed cases of dengue. The most frequent symptoms were fever, headache, vomiting, and muscle and joint pains. The tourniquet test was positive and thrombocytopenia was confirmed in 56% and 44% of the patients, respectively. Epistaxis (67%) was the most common hemorrhagic sign. Of the 356 serum samples received through the dengue surveillance systems in October 1994, IgM antibodies were detected in 43%. The virus was isolated from 5 of 24 samples tested (serotype 3 from 3 and serotype 1 from 2). The reintroduction of serotype 3 of dengue into the Region was demonstrated, along with its ability to produce epidemics of hemorrhagic dengue. The countries are warned that if they do not quickly take the measures described in the guidelines for the prevention and control of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever, new epidemics may occur in the Americas, given the large number of persons susceptible to this serotype and the high density of the mosquito vector in most of the countries of the Region.","['Guzman, M G', 'Vazquez, S', 'Martinez, E', 'Alvarez, M', 'Rodriguez, R', 'Kouri, G', 'de los Reyes, J', 'Acevedo, F']","['Guzman MG', 'Vazquez S', 'Martinez E', 'Alvarez M', 'Rodriguez R', 'Kouri G', 'de los Reyes J', 'Acevedo F']",,"['Instituto de Medicina Tropical Pedro Kouri, La Habana, Cuba.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Bol Oficina Sanit Panam,Boletin de la Oficina Sanitaria Panamericana.

METHODS: A cognitive-cultural anthropological study was conducted involving the participation of 160 adults selected through purposeful sampling. The techniques of free lists and pile-sorting were used for investigating terms associated with the concept ""dengue."" A consensus analysis was carried out by the factoring of principal components, hierarchical cluster analysis, and multidimensional scaling. RESULTS: Greater consensus was observed among participants from the population having more historical experience with dengue-Santiago Ixcuintla, Nayarit-as well as more structured cultural and complex dimensions than in Guadalajara. In the latter case, participants showed a more fragmented conception of dengue, with insufficient information on its symptoms, mechanisms of transmission, and vector reservoirs. Three cultural dimensions were identified as hindering dengue prevention: confusing and insufficient information, placing responsibility for prevention on other people or on public agencies, and excessive confidence in fumigation as a preventive measure. CONCLUSIONS: These obstacles will need to be taken into account in the design and implementation of future prevention campaigns, disseminating information that explains the risks of fumigation and the importance of citizens and authorities jointly participating in the search for a comprehensive and sustainable solution to the dengue problem.","['Torres Lopez, Teresa M', 'Guerrero Cordero, Joana Lizeth', 'Salazar Estrada, Jose Guadalupe']","['Torres Lopez TM', 'Guerrero Cordero JL', 'Salazar Estrada JG']",,"['Universidad de Guadalajara, Centro Universitario de Ciencias de la Salud, Departamento de Salud Publica, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. tere.torres.cucs@gmail.com']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Rev Panam Salud Publica,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,9705400,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anthropology, Cultural', '*Cultural Characteristics', 'Dengue/complications/*prevention & control/transmission', 'Female', 'Fumigation/adverse effects', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Sex Factors']",,2012/05/10 06:00,2012/08/30 06:00,['2012/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['S1020-49892012000300003 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Panam Salud Publica. 2012 Mar;31(3):197-203.,3,,,,,,,,,Dimensiones culturales del dengue que favorecen o dificultan su prevencion en Mexico.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were also case reports of dengue fever preceding GBS. With the aim to understand the mechanisms of GBS and dengue outbreaks, this ecological study investigates the relationships between GBS, dengue, meteorological factors in Hong Kong and global climatic factors from January 2000 to June 2016. METHODS: The correlations between GBS, dengue, Multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation Index (MEI) and local meteorological data were explored by Spearman's Rank correlations and cross-correlations. Three Poisson regression models were fitted to identify non-linear associations among GBS, dengue and MEI. Cross wavelet analyses were applied to infer potential non-stationary oscillating associations among GBS, dengue and MEI. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: We report a substantial increasing of local GBS and dengue cases (mainly imported) in recent year in Hong Kong. The seasonalities of GBS and dengue are different, in particular, GBS is low while dengue is high in the summer. We found weak but significant correlations between GBS and local meteorological factors. MEI could explain over 17% of dengue's variations based on Poisson regression analyses. We report a possible non-stationary oscillating association between dengue fever and GBS cases in Hong Kong. This study has led to an improved understanding about the timing and ecological relationships between MEI, GBS and dengue.","['Tang, Xiujuan', 'Zhao, Shi', 'Chiu, Alice P Y', 'Wang, Xin', 'Yang, Lin', 'He, Daihai']","['Tang X', 'Zhao S', 'Chiu APY', 'Wang X', 'Yang L', 'He D']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3253-654X'],"['Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Applied Mathematics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Applied Mathematics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China.', 'School of Nursing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Applied Mathematics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171204,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Chikungunya virus/isolation & purification', 'Cold Temperature/*adverse effects', 'Dengue/complications/*epidemiology', 'Dengue Virus/isolation & purification', '*Disease Outbreaks', '*El Nino-Southern Oscillation', 'Guillain-Barre Syndrome/*epidemiology/virology', 'Hong Kong/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Seasons', 'Sunlight', 'Zika Virus/isolation & purification', 'Zika Virus Infection/epidemiology']",PMC5714337,2017/12/05 06:00,2017/12/30 06:00,['2017/12/05 06:00'],"['2017/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-17-22683 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0187830 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Dec 4;12(12):e0187830. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0187830. eCollection 2017.,12,,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It will then be possible after this information is obtained to assess whether screening is feasible and to identify approaches that are most cost-effective on the basis of characteristics of local populations and seasonality of dengue.","['Wilder-Smith, Annelies', 'Chen, Lin H', 'Massad, Eduardo', 'Wilson, Mary E']","['Wilder-Smith A', 'Chen LH', 'Massad E', 'Wilson ME']",,"['Department of Medicine, National University Singapore, Singapore. epvws@pacific.net.sg']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Emerg Infect Dis,Emerging infectious diseases,9508155,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood/virology', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*transmission/virology', 'Dengue Virus/*isolation & purification', '*Endemic Diseases', 'Humans', 'Mass Screening', '*Models, Biological', '*Risk Assessment', 'Singapore/epidemiology', '*Transfusion Reaction', 'Young Adult']",PMC2660677,2009/01/01 09:00,2009/03/19 09:00,['2009/01/01 09:00'],"['2009/01/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/19 09:00 [medline]']","['07-1097 [pii]', '10.3201/eid1501.071097 [doi]']",ppublish,Emerg Infect Dis. 2009 Jan;15(1):8-11. doi: 10.3201/eid1501.071097.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dengue also persists as a scientific and technological challenge since there is no effective treatment, vaccine, vector control or public health intervention. Combining bibliometrics and social network analysis methods can support the mapping of dengue research and development (R&D) activities worldwide. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to map the scientific scenario related to dengue research worldwide. METHODS: We use scientific publication data from Web of Science Core Collection - articles indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) - and combine bibliometrics and social network analysis techniques to identify the most relevant journals, scientific references, research areas, countries and research organisations in the dengue scientific landscape. FINDINGS: Our results show a significant increase of dengue publications over time; tropical medicine and virology as the most frequent research areas and biochemistry and molecular biology as the most central area in the network; USA and Brazil as the most productive countries; and Mahidol University and Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz as the main research organisations and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention as the most central organisation in the collaboration network. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our findings can be used to strengthen a global knowledge platform guiding policy, planning and funding decisions as well as to providing directions to researchers and institutions. So that, by offering to the scientific community, policy makers and public health practitioners a mapping of the dengue scientific landscape, this paper has aimed to contribute to upcoming debates, decision-making and planning on dengue R&D and public health strategies worldwide.","['Mota, Fabio Batista', 'Fonseca, Bruna de Paula Fonseca E', 'Galina, Andreia Cristina', 'Silva, Roseli Monteiro da']","['Mota FB', 'Fonseca BPFE', 'Galina AC', 'Silva RMD']",,"['Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Vice-Presidencia de Pesquisa e Laboratorios de Referencia, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Centro de Desenvolvimento Tecnologico em Saude, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Vice-Presidencia de Pesquisa e Laboratorios de Referencia, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Centro de Desenvolvimento Tecnologico em Saude, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170327,Brazil,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,7502619,,IM,"['*Bibliometrics', 'Biomedical Research/*statistics & numerical data', '*Dengue', '*Global Health', 'Humans']",PMC5398162,2017/04/27 06:00,2017/08/25 06:00,['2017/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0074-02762017005005103 [pii]', '0074-02760160423 [pii]', '10.1590/0074-02760160423 [doi]']",ppublish,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz. 2017 May;112(5):354-363. doi: 10.1590/0074-02760160423.

Jawans, stationed at Calcutta during May-July, 1993. The illness was associated with fever, severe headache, bodyache and arthralgia which lasted for 2-4 days in most of the cases. Fifty cases were examined clinically and blood samples (both acute and convalescent) were subjected to virological study. One mouse-pathogenic agent could be isolated in suckling mice and identified as DEN-3. Sero-investigation of 50 single sera by HI & CF method revealed evidence of presumptive dengue infection in 33, while sero-conversion could be noted in 10 out of 25 available paired sera tested. Results of MAC ELISA revealed evidence of primary dengue infection in 6 out of 12 acute phase sera examined. Thus, the study shows that the episode is strongly suggestive of primary dengue infection.","['Bhattacharjee, N', 'De, P M', 'Chakravarti, S K', 'Chakraborty, M S', 'Neogi, D K', 'Mukherjee, K K']","['Bhattacharjee N', 'De PM', 'Chakravarti SK', 'Chakraborty MS', 'Neogi DK', 'Mukherjee KK']",,"['Department of Virology, School of Tropical Medicine, Calcutta, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Commun Dis,The Journal of communicable diseases,0261652,,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Complement Fixation Tests', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Dengue Virus/*isolation & purification', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Police']",,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Commun Dis. 1995 Jun;27(2):70-6.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease may range from clinically asymptomatic infections to severe and fatal outcomes. We aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical and laboratorial aspects of the dengue fatal cases received by a Regional Reference Laboratory, Brazil in 30 years. METHODS: A total of 1047 suspected fatal dengue cases were received from 1986 to 2015 and analyzed in the Laboratory of Flavivirus, FIOCRUZ. Suspected cases were submitted to viral detection, serological and molecular methods for cases confirmation. Influence of gender, age, serotype and type of infection (primary/secondary) on death outcome, as well the interactions between serotype and age or infection and age and type of infection were also studied. RESULTS: A total of 359 cases (34.2%) were confirmed and DENV-1 (11.1%), DENV-2 (43.9%), DENV-3 (32.8%) and DENV-4 (13.7%) were detected. Overall, fatal cases occurred more often in primary infections (59.3%, p = 0.001). However, in 2008, fatal cases were mainly associated to secondary infections (p = 0.003). In 2008 and 2011, deaths were more frequent on children and those infected by DENV-2 presented a higher risk for fatal outcome. Moreover, children with secondary infections had a 4-fold higher risk for death. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue is a multifactorial disease and, factors such as viral strain/serotype, occurrence of secondary infections and co-morbidities may lead to a severe outcome. However, the high dengue incidence and transmission during epidemics, such as those observed in Brazil may overwhelm and collapse the public health services, potentially impacting on increased disease severity and mortality.","['Nunes, Priscila Conrado Guerra', 'de Filippis, Ana Maria Bispo', 'Lima, Monique Queiroz da Rocha', 'Faria, Nieli Rodrigues da Costa', 'de Bruycker-Nogueira, Fernanda', 'Santos, Jaqueline Bastos', 'Heringer, Manoela', 'Chouin-Carneiro, Thais', 'Couto-Lima, Dinair', 'de Santis Goncalves, Bianca', 'Sampaio, Simone Alves', 'de Araujo, Eliane Saraiva Machado', 'Sanchez-Arcila, Juan Camilo', 'Dos Santos, Flavia Barreto', 'Nogueira, Rita Maria Ribeiro']","['Nunes PCG', 'de Filippis AMB', 'Lima MQDR', 'Faria NRDC', 'de Bruycker-Nogueira F', 'Santos JB', 'Heringer M', 'Chouin-Carneiro T', 'Couto-Lima D', 'de Santis Goncalves B', 'Sampaio SA', 'de Araujo ESM', 'Sanchez-Arcila JC', 'Dos Santos FB', 'Nogueira RMR']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1309-5366'],"['Viral Immunology Laboratory (LIV), Oswaldo Cruz Institute, IOC, FIOCRUZ, Avenida Brasil, 4365.

It is transmitted through the bites of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. With the expansion of Aedes albopictus and increasing travel exchange, it is no longer limited to the tropical zone and transmission has been documented in temperate areas. In mainland France, where Aedes albopictus has been present and disseminating since 2004, 2 episodes of autochthonous transmission occurred in 2010 and in 2013. Control measures against dengue and chikungunya, which shares the same vector, are implemented every year since 2006, in the areas where the vector is present. They aim at preventing or limiting local transmission of these diseases. They are based on epidemiological and entomological surveillance and vector control measures. The diagnosis of dengue, and chikungunya should be considered in case of suggestive symptoms in patients returning from an area of virus circulation. It should also be considered for patients living or having stayed in areas of mainland France where Aedes albopictus is present, during its activity period from May 1 to November 30. The prevention and control system, including vector control measures and the notification of cases to the local health authority should be known, as the risk of autochthonous transmission increases every year.","['Paty, M-C']",['Paty MC'],,"[""Departement des maladies infectieuses, institut de veille sanitaire, 12, rue du Val-d'Osne, 94415 Saint-Maurice cedex, France.

Mathematical models describing the transmission of dengue viruses have focussed on the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect and temporary cross-immunity trying to explain the irregular behavior of dengue epidemics by analyzing available data. However, no systematic investigation of the possible dynamical structures has been performed so far. Our study focuses on a seasonally forced (non-autonomous) model with temporary cross-immunity and possible secondary infection, motivated by dengue fever epidemiology. The notion of at least two different strains is needed in a minimalistic model to describe differences between primary infections, often asymptomatic, and secondary infection, associated with the severe form of the disease. We extend the previously studied non-seasonal (autonomous) model by adding seasonal forcing, mimicking the vectorial dynamics, and a low import of infected individuals, which is realistic in the dynamics of dengue fever epidemics. A comparative study between three different scenarios (non-seasonal, low seasonal and high seasonal with a low import of infected individuals) is performed. The extended models show complex dynamics and qualitatively a good agreement between empirical DHF monitoring data and the obtained model simulation. We discuss the role of seasonal forcing and the import of infected individuals in such systems, the biological relevance and its implications for the analysis of the available dengue data. At the moment only such minimalistic models have a chance to be qualitatively understood well and eventually tested against existing data. The simplicity of the model (low number of parameters and state variables) offer a promising perspective on parameter values inference from the DHF case notifications.","['Aguiar, Maira', 'Ballesteros, Sebastien', 'Kooi, Bob W', 'Stollenwerk, Nico']","['Aguiar M', 'Ballesteros S', 'Kooi BW', 'Stollenwerk N']",,"['Centro de Matematica e Aplicacoes Fundamentais da Universidade de Lisboa, Avenida Prof. Gama Pinto 2, 1649-003 Lisboa, Portugal. maira@ptmat.fc.ul.pt']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110909,England,J Theor Biol,Journal of theoretical biology,0376342,,IM,"['Dengue/*epidemiology/immunology/virology', 'Dengue Virus/classification', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', '*Models, Biological', 'Recurrence', '*Seasons', 'Severe Dengue/epidemiology/immunology/virology']",,2011/09/13 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2011/09/13 06:00'],"['2011/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-5193(11)00446-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.08.043 [doi]']",ppublish,J Theor Biol. 2011 Nov 21;289:181-96. doi: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.08.043.

Early case identification and timely initiation of treatment for patients with severe dengue can reduce medical complications and mortality. To determine clinical management and reporting practices, and assess knowledge of dengue and its management, a survey was sent to 2,512 physicians with a medical license in Puerto Rico. Of the 2,313 physicians who received the survey, 817 (35%) completed the questionnaire. Of the respondents, 708 were currently practicing medicine; 138 were board certified (Group 1), 282 were board eligible (Group 2), and 288 had not finished residency (Group 3). Although respondents clinically diagnosed, on average, 12 cases of dengue in the preceding three months, 31% did not report any suspected cases to public health officials while about half (56%) reported all cases. Overall, 29% of respondents correctly identified early signs of shock and 48% identified severe abdominal pain and persistent vomiting as warning signs for severe dengue with the proportion of correct respondents highest in Group 1. Reportedly about sixty percent (57%) appropriately never give corticosteroids or prophylactic platelet transfusions to dengue patients. One third (30%) of respondents correctly identified administration of intravenous colloid solution as the best treatment option for dengue patients with refractory shock and elevated hematocrit after an initial trial of intravenous crystalloids, and nearly one half (46%) correctly identified administration of a blood transfusion as the best option for dengue patients with refractory shock and decreased hematocrit after a trial of intravenous crystalloids. Even though dengue has been endemic in Puerto Rico for nearly 4 decades, knowledge of dengue management is still limited, compliance with WHO treatment guidelines is suboptimal, and underreporting is significant.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of questionnaire-related dengue studies conducted in the Philippines and evaluates their reliability and validity in these surveys. METHODS: A review protocol constructed by a panel of experienced academic reviewers was used to formulate the methodology, research design, search strategy and selection criteria. An extensive literature search was conducted between March-June 2020 in various major electronic biomedical databases including PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and ScienceDirect. A systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) were selected as the preferred item reporting method. RESULTS: Out of a total of 34 peer-reviewed dengue-related KAP studies that were identified, 15 published from 2000 to April 2020 met the inclusion criteria. Based on the meta-analysis, a poor mean score was obtained for each of knowledge (68.89), attitude (49.86) and preventive practice (64.69). Most respondents were equipped with a good knowledge of the major clinical signs of dengue. Worryingly, 95% of respondents showed several negative attitudes towards dengue prevention, claiming that this was not possible and that enacting preventive practices was not their responsibility. Interestingly, television or radio was claimed as the main source of gaining dengue information (range 50-95%). Lastly, only five articles (33.3%) piloted or pretested their questionnaire before surveying, of which three reported Cronbach's alpha coefficient (range 0.70 to 0.90). CONCLUSION: This review indicates that to combat the growing public health threat of dengue to the Philippines, we need the active participation of resident communities, full engagement of healthcare personnel, promotion of awareness campaigns, and access to safe complementary and alternative medicines. Importantly, the psychometric properties of each questionnaire should be assessed rigorously.","['Guad, Rhanye Mac', 'Carandang, Rogie Royce', 'Solidum, Judilynn N', 'W Taylor-Robinson, Andrew', 'Wu, Yuan Seng', 'Aung, Yin Nwe', 'Low, Wah Yun', 'Sim, Maw Shin', 'Sekaran, Shamala Devi', 'Azizan, Nornazirah']","['Guad RM', 'Carandang RR', 'Solidum JN', 'W Taylor-Robinson A', 'Wu YS', 'Aung YN', 'Low WY', 'Sim MS', 'Sekaran SD', 'Azizan N']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2453-3760', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6668-911X']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Life Sciences, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Department of Biomedical Science and Therapeutics, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia.', 'Department of Community and Global Health, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'College of Pharmacy, University of the Philippines, Manila, Philippines.', 'School of Health, Medical & Applied Sciences, Central Queensland University, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'College of Health & Human Sciences, Charles Darwin University, Casuarina, NT, Australia.', 'College of Health Sciences, Vin University, Gia Lam District, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Centre for Virus and Vaccine Research, School of Medical and Life Sciences, Sunway University, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, School of Medical and Life Sciences, Sunway University, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, UCSI University, Port Dickson, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Asia-Europe Institute, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Life Sciences, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, UCSI University, Port Dickson, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20211220,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Dengue/etiology/*prevention & control/psychology/virology', 'Dengue Virus/*isolation & purification', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Personnel/*psychology', 'Health Services Research/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Philippines/epidemiology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surveys and Questionnaires/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC8687574,2021/12/21 06:00,2022/01/11 06:00,['2021/12/20 17:25'],"['2021/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/20 17:25 [entrez]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-21-14318 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0261412 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Dec 20;16(12):e0261412. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0261412. eCollection 2021.,12,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is hypothesised that host innate immune response factors are involved in modulating the disease outcome and the expression levels of genes involved in this response could be used as early prognostic markers for disease severity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: mRNA expression levels of genes involved in DENV innate immune responses were measured using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). Here, we present a novel application of the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm to analyze the expression pattern of 12 genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 28 dengue patients (13 DHF and 15 DF) during acute viral infection. The SVM model was trained using gene expression data of these genes and achieved the highest accuracy of approximately 85% with leave-one-out cross-validation. Through selective removal of gene expression data from the SVM model, we have identified seven genes (MYD88, TLR7, TLR3, MDA5, IRF3, IFN-alpha and CLEC5A) that may be central in differentiating DF patients from DHF, with MYD88 and TLR7 observed to be the most important. Though the individual removal of expression data of five other genes had no impact on the overall accuracy, a significant combined role was observed when the SVM model of the two main genes (MYD88 and TLR7) was re-trained to include the five genes, increasing the overall accuracy to approximately 96%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Here, we present a novel use of the SVM algorithm to classify DF and DHF patients, as well as to elucidate the significance of the various genes involved. It was observed that seven genes are critical in classifying DF and DHF patients: TLR3, MDA5, IRF3, IFN-alpha, CLEC5A, and the two most important MYD88 and TLR7. While these preliminary results are promising, further experimental investigation is necessary to validate their specific roles in dengue disease.","['Gomes, Ana Lisa V', 'Wee, Lawrence J K', 'Khan, Asif M', 'Gil, Laura H V G', 'Marques, Ernesto T A Jr', 'Calzavara-Silva, Carlos E', 'Tan, Tin Wee']","['Gomes AL', 'Wee LJ', 'Khan AM', 'Gil LH', 'Marques ET Jr', 'Calzavara-Silva CE', 'Tan TW']",,"['Department of Virology and Experimental Therapy, Aggeu Magalhaes Research Center-CPqAM/FIOCRUZ, Recife, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100623,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Dengue/*classification/genetics/immunology', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",PMC2890409,2010/06/30 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/06/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10-PONE-RA-16107R1 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0011267 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Jun 23;5(6):e11267. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0011267.,6,,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The availability of weekly reports of dengue cases in Singapore offers the opportunity to analyze the transmission dynamics and the impact of vector control strategies. Based on a previous model studying the impact of vector control strategies in Singapore during the 2005 outbreak, a simple vector-host model accounting for seasonal fluctuation in vector density was developed to estimate the parameters governing the vector population dynamics using dengue fever incidence data from August 2003 to December 2007. The impact of vector control, which consisted principally of a systematic removal of actual and potential breeding sites during a six-week period in 2005, was also investigated. Although our approach does not account for the complex life cycle of the vector, the good fit between data and model outputs showed that the impact of seasonality on the transmission dynamics is highly important. Moreover, the periodic fluctuations of the vector population were found in phase with temperature variations, suggesting a strong climate effect on the vector density and, in turn, on the transmission dynamics.","['Andraud, Mathieu', 'Hens, Niel', 'Beutels, Philippe']","['Andraud M', 'Hens N', 'Beutels P']",,"['Centre for Health Economics Research and Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CHERMID), Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), University of Antwerp, Belgium. mathieu.andraud@ua.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130419,United States,Math Biosci,Mathematical biosciences,0103146,,IM,"['Dengue/epidemiology/*transmission/virology', '*Dengue Virus/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Models, Biological', 'Singapore/epidemiology']",,2013/04/24 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/04/24 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0025-5564(13)00097-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mbs.2013.04.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Math Biosci. 2013 Jul;244(1):22-8. doi: 10.1016/j.mbs.2013.04.001.

Healthcare services in low- and middle-income countries treat the majority of dengue cases worldwide. However, the clinical decision-making processes which result in effective treatment are poorly characterised within this setting. In order to improve clinical care through interventions relating to digital clinical decision-support systems (CDSS), we set out to establish a framework for clinical decision-making in dengue management to inform implementation. METHODS: We utilised process mapping and task analysis methods to characterise existing dengue management at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This is a tertiary referral hospital which manages approximately 30,000 patients with dengue each year, accepting referrals from Ho Chi Minh city and the surrounding catchment area. Initial findings were expanded through semi-structured interviews with clinicians in order to understand clinical reasoning and cognitive factors in detail. A grounded theory was used for coding and emergent themes were developed through iterative discussions with clinician-researchers. RESULTS: Key clinical decision-making points were identified: (i) at the initial patient evaluation for dengue diagnosis to decide on hospital admission and the provision of fluid/blood product therapy, (ii) in those patients who develop severe disease or other complications, (iii) at the point of recurrent shock in balancing the need for fluid therapy with complications of volume overload. From interviews the following themes were identified: prioritising clinical diagnosis and evaluation over existing diagnostics, the role of dengue guidelines published by the Ministry of Health, the impact of seasonality and caseload on decision-making strategies, and the potential role of digital decision-support and disease scoring tools. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the contemporary priorities in delivering clinical care to patients with dengue in an endemic setting.

According the World Health Organization 70 to 500 million persons are infected every year including 2 million who develop hemorrhagic form and 20,000 who die. Children are at highest risk for death. Due to the absence of specialized laboratories in most endemic regions and to the lack of specifici clinical presentation, the incidence of dengue and its economic costs are certainly underestimated. Dengue iscaused by an arbovirus belonging to the Flavivirus genus of the family Flaviviridae. There are four dengue virus serotypes and no cross protection between them. The disease is transmitted through the bites of mosquitoes belonging to the Aedes genus, mainly Aedes aegypti. However A. albopictus has played an important role in the spread of the disease and other species may be involved in specific locations (e.g., A. polynesiensis in the South Pacific). There is no specific treatment for dengue. Management of severe forms depends on symptomatic treatment of hemorrhagic complications and hypovolemic shock. Prevention requires control of vector mosquitoes that is difficult to implement and maintain. Dengue is a major emerging infectious disease with a heavy impact on public health. The high human and economic costs as well as the absence of specific preventive measures underscore the need to develop a vaccine. However finding and distributing such a vaccine to populations at risk is hampered by numerous obstacles. The most notable challenges standing in the way of development of a candidate vaccine are as follows: absence of an animal model, which has important implications for the preclinical development strategy; need to develop a live attenuated vaccine; existence of 4 antigenically distinct serotypes with the resulting risk of competition between vaccine strains; immunologic risks related to antibody-dependent enhancement that has been hypothesized to be the cause of severe forms of the illness; absence of a well defined correlate of protection and preexisting vaccine, which will require the organization of large-scale pre-clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the virus; complexity associated with industrial production of a tetravalent vaccine. Development and production of a safe and reliable vaccine are only the first steps to ensuring protection of the populations at risk, It twill also be necessary to identify and take into account a variety of geographic, economic, regulatory, and logistic factors: The epidemiological profile of dengue is variable. For example the age at which the likelihood of developing the disease is highest is not the same in Asia and Latin America. Vaccination programs must be tailored to regional and national epidemiological specificities. Introduction of dengue vaccination in the national immunization programs must take into account the special features of each country without jeopardizing the existing vaccines already in use. The need for an additional visit can represent a hardship both economically and logistically. Alternative funding will be needed to finance vaccination programs in some countries located in endemic zones, Long-term phase 4 effectiveness and tolerance field studies must be planned in collaboration with national authorities. All these challenges and obstacles have been taken into account in the development of Sanofi Pasteur's live attenuated tetravalent vaccine. Research for development of a dengue vaccine began during the 1990s. Clinical studies with the most promising tetravalent vaccine were started in the 2000s. A trial carried out in adults in the United States has shown that administration of three doses of the tetravalent candidate vaccine was 100% successful in inducing an antibody response capable of neutralizing all four dengue virus serotypes. Phase II clinical trials are now under way in children and adults in Mexico, Peru, and the Philippines. The first efficacy trial in children began in Thailand in February 2009. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy of the tetravalent dengue vaccine in children. The study is being conducted in the Ratchaburi province in collaboration with the University of Mahidol and the Thai Ministry of Health as well as the Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative (PDVI). This efficacy trial will be an important step for successful development of a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine.","['Teyssou, R']",['Teyssou R'],,"['Sanofi Pasteur Lyon, France. remy.teyssou@sanofipasteur.com']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,France,Med Trop (Mars),Medecine tropicale : revue du Corps de sante colonial,8710146,['0 (Dengue Vaccines)'],IM,"['Dengue/*prevention & control/transmission', '*Dengue Vaccines', 'Humans', 'Public Health']",,2009/09/04 06:00,2009/10/30 06:00,['2009/09/04 09:00'],"['2009/09/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Med Trop (Mars). 2009 Aug;69(4):333-4.,4,,,,,,,,,La dengue: de la maladie a la vaccination.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reported five consecutive cases of dengue virus infection, with circulating plasma cells. CASE REPORTS: Three women and two men, aged 26 to 75 years, had returned from French West Indies less than one week before the onset of the symptoms (mean: 2.5 days). The transient blood plasmacytosis was variable in intensity (0.1 to 0.8 G/L) with a maximal level between the fourth and the seventh day following the onset of the symptoms, and was associated in four patients, with activated lymphocytes and lympho-plasma cells. CONCLUSION: Reactive plasmacytosis during dengue fever is common and probably underestimated because it is transient and only identified by careful microscopic examination of a blood smear.

Important for understanding the epidemiology of dengue nowadays refers to the knowledge of the patterns of spatial-temporal diffusion, though there is few research addressing this issue. This study describes the process of dissemination of dengue in the state of Bahia, from 1994 to 2000. METHODS: This ecological study space-time, with the units of analysis, county, epidemiological week, month, trimester and year. There has been construction of the trend line and has been mapping the sequential occurrence of dengue in the municipality for the period. RESULTS: There were 164,050 reported cases of dengue and the introduction of this virus in Bahia, unlike other states, occurred on a small city, though there is intermittency in spatial and temporal records of cases at the beginning of this epidemic. The virus circulated in all climatic zones fact what highlight its high transmission power. The highest intensity of detection of cases and territorial expansion was in the littoral (zone humid and half-humid) ideal area for the survive of the vector. CONCLUSIONS: Hypothetically, the intermittent space-time pattern initially observed, could have allowed the control of the progression of the epidemic, if structured action to vectorial combat was carried out.","['Melo, Maria Suely Silva', 'Barreto, Florisneide Rodrigues', 'Costa, Maria da Conceicao Nascimento', 'Morato, Vanessa Cristina', 'Teixeira, Maria Gloria']","['Melo MS', 'Barreto FR', 'Costa Mda C', 'Morato VC', 'Teixeira MG']",,"['Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, BA.']",['por'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Brazil,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical,7507456,,IM,"['Animals', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/transmission/virology', '*Dengue Virus', 'Humans', '*Insect Vectors', 'Risk Factors', 'Space-Time Clustering']",,2010/05/14 06:00,2010/08/04 06:00,['2010/05/14 06:00'],"['2009/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0037-86822010000200007 [pii]', '10.1590/s0037-86822010000200007 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop. 2010 Mar-Apr;43(2):139-44. doi: 10.1590/s0037-86822010000200007.,2,,,,,,,,,"Progressao da circulacao do virus do dengue no Estado da Bahia, 1994-2000.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is hypothesised that dengue serotypes could be a possible factor for such phenomena and therefore be a possible predictor for the development of severe dengue. METHOD: A retrospective cohort study was done to explore the association between dengue serotypes and the various complications. All patients who underwent dengue serotyping from 1st January to 31st December 2018 in Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital were selected. Serotypes were randomly done for admitted dengue patients. Notes were then retrieved for data collection. Secondary outcomes like length of stay and highest lactate level were also studied. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 20. RESULT: A total of 193 patient records were included in the analysis. Chi-square test for independence indicated that the proportion of dengue complications between male and female were significantly different (chi(2)(1) = 11.37, p = 0.001). Dengue serotype was not associated with the development of dengue complications, total number of dengue complications, length of admission, lactate level and survival among the serotypes. Results of the binary logistic regression showed that men have thrice the odds (AOR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.6 6.7) for developing dengue complications. One patient was found to be co-infected with serotype 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: Our study did not reveal any association between the different dengue virus serotypes and its complications. Therefore, all dengue infection should be approached with equal meticulousness. There are possibilities that apart from serotype, dengue genotype and lineage would determine clinical outcome. However, more studies are required to study such associations.","['Lau, Q', 'Lee, Z M', 'Shunmugarajoo, A', 'Tan, C Y', 'Azmel, A', 'Yap, S Y']","['Lau Q', 'Lee ZM', 'Shunmugarajoo A', 'Tan CY', 'Azmel A', 'Yap SY']",,"['Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah, Internal Medicine Department, Ministry of Health, Selangor, Malaysia. qinglinlau@gmail.com.', 'Hospital Duchness of Kent, Internal Medicine, Ministry of Health, Sabah, Malaysia.', 'Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah, Internal Medicine Department, Ministry of Health, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah, Infectious Disease Unit, Ministry of Health, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah, Infectious Disease Unit, Ministry of Health, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah, Clinical Research Center (CRC), Ministry of Health, Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Malaysia,Med J Malaysia,The Medical journal of Malaysia,0361547,['0 (Lactates)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Male', 'Female', '*Dengue/complications/epidemiology', '*Dengue Virus/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Severe Dengue', 'Lactates']",,2023/06/05 00:42,2023/06/06 06:42,['2023/06/04 23:43'],"['2023/06/06 06:42 [medline]', '2023/06/05 00:42 [pubmed]', '2023/06/04 23:43 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med J Malaysia. 2023 May;78(3):372-378.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dengue was grouped by informants with other mild febrile illnesses, all of which were thought to be inevitable and capable of converting into more serious illnesses. Although vector control personnel think of prevention in terms of eliminating the larval habitats of mosquito vectors, the form of prevention most commonly described involved looking after oneself once sick, so that mild fevers do not evolve into serious fevers. Due to the prevalence of this different model of prevention, it is argued that simple messages about dengue may be misinterpreted. Vector control programmes need to take into account local models of febrile illnesses and their prevention in order to be effective.","['Winch, P', 'Lloyd, L', 'Godas, M D', 'Kendall, C']","['Winch P', 'Lloyd L', 'Godas MD', 'Kendall C']",,"['Center for International Community Based Health Research, School of Hygiene and Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Trop Med Hyg,The Journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,0406044,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aedes', 'Animals', '*Attitude to Health', 'Child', 'Dengue/etiology/*prevention & control/transmission', 'Fever/etiology', 'Health Education', 'Humans', 'Insect Vectors', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Mexico', 'Weather']",,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Trop Med Hyg. 1991 Dec;94(6):377-87.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The retrospective descriptive analytical study was done with a case record analysis of patients with dengue fever admitted from January to December 2010 at five tertiary care hospitals in different Pakistani cities. Using a questionnaire, information was gathered on demography, haematological profile, management, use of blood and platelet transfusions and the outcome. For comparison, data of serologically-confirmed dengue patients from a private laboratory in Islamabad was collected to see the age, gender and month-wise distribution of cases tested over the same period. SPSS 16 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Out of the 841 confirmed dengue cases, 514 (79%) were males and 139 (21%) females. The overall mean age was 31.3 +/- 14.0 years. Dengue fever was seen in 653 (78%) and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) in 188 (22%) patients. Most cases were between 20 and 49 years of age. A gradual increase in dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever was seen from August, with a peak in October/November. Tourniquet test was done only in 20 (2.3%) cases, out of which 11 (55%) were positive and 9 (45%) were negative. Serial haematocrit was not done in any case. Total deaths were 5 (0.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Most cases were seen in October/November with the majority being in the 20-39 age group. Tourniquet test and serial haematocrit were infrequently used.

A comprehensive household-level mosquito vector survey and interview was conducted to obtain data on mosquito species and breeding as well as illness consistent with dengue. Clusters of dengue illnesses and high-density vector populations were observed in a distinct sector of the city. Dengue clusters are less identifiable in areas further away from major hospitals, suggesting that proximity to hospitals determines whether cases of dengue are diagnosed. Focusing on those areas relatively close to hospitals, we found a spatial association between dengue clusters and vector populations. Households reporting a recent dengue illness were more likely to have Aedes albopictus larvae present in the home when compared with households not reporting cases. Households reporting a recent dengue illness were also more likely to have a neighbor with Ae. albopictus present in the home. In contrast, the presence of Aedes aegypti within the premises as well as the homes of neighbors (within 50 meters) was not associated with dengue illness. Given that the breeding habitats for Ae. albopictus are somewhat distinct from those of Ae. aegypti, the findings of this study have implications for control of dengue transmission in this urban setting where much of the focus has been on indoor mosquito breeding and transmission. Public health officials may find the disease-environment map useful for planning targeted interventions because it displays areas where transmission is most intense.","['Ali, Mohammad', 'Wagatsuma, Yukiko', 'Emch, Michael', 'Breiman, Robert F']","['Ali M', 'Wagatsuma Y', 'Emch M', 'Breiman RF']",,"['Centre for Health and Population Research, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh. mali@ivi.int']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Trop Med Hyg,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,0370507,,IM,"['Aedes/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Attitude to Health', 'Bangladesh/epidemiology', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control/*transmission', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Geography', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Insect Vectors/*physiology', 'Larva/physiology', 'Mosquito Control', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Urban Health']",,2004/01/27 05:00,2004/02/10 05:00,['2004/01/27 05:00'],"['2004/01/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/27 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2003 Dec;69(6):634-40.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results showed that the geographical distribution of imported DF cases has significantly expanded in mainland Australia over the past decade. In recent years, the geographical distribution of source countries of DF has expanded from the Pacific region and Asia to include Africa and the Americas. Australia is now exposed to dengue importations from all of the regions involved in the current global pandemic. The public health implications of a range expansion of dengue mosquito vectors are severe. Enhanced mosquito surveillance in those areas that have high imported cases is called for to reduce emerging threats from this globally expanding pathogen.","['Huang, Xiaodong', 'Yakob, Laith', 'Devine, Gregor', 'Frentiu, Francesca D', 'Fu, Shiu-Yun', 'Hu, Wenbiao']","['Huang X', 'Yakob L', 'Devine G', 'Frentiu FD', 'Fu SY', 'Hu W']",,"['School of Public Health and Social Work, Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Disease Control, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London WC1E 7HT, UK.', 'Mosquito Control Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Nursing, College of Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'School of Public Health and Social Work, Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160727,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,IM,"['Australia', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/transmission', 'Humans', 'Models, Statistical']",PMC4961948,2016/07/28 06:00,2018/04/24 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['srep30360 [pii]', '10.1038/srep30360 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Jul 27;6:30360. doi: 10.1038/srep30360.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is shown that the model exhibits the phenomenon of backward bifurcation when the disease-induced mortality in the host population exceeds a certain threshold value or if the vaccine does not provide perfect protection against infection with the two strains. In the absence of backward bifurcation, the disease-free equilibrium of the model is shown to be globally-asymptotically stable whenever the associated reproduction number is less than unity. It is shown that the community-wide use of the vaccine could induce positive, negative or no population-level impact, depending on the sign of a certain epidemiological threshold quantity (known as the vaccine impact factor). Simulations of the model, using data from Oaxaca, Mexico, show that, although the community-wide use of the vaccine will significantly reduce dengue burden in the community, it is unable to lead to the elimination of the two dengue strains. It is further shown that the use of Dengvaxia vaccine in dengue-naive populations may induce increased risk of severe disease in these populations.","['Iboi, Enahoro A', 'Gumel, Abba B']","['Iboi EA', 'Gumel AB']",,"['School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA.', 'School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA.

The history of dengue fever in Australia will be presented and the prospects for the future discussed. DISCUSSION: Dengue fever was common in Australia in the late 19th century and the first clinical description of DHF were published by an Australian clinician in Charters Towers north Queensland. Since that time there have been sporadic outbreaks of dengue fever. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of epidemics in north Queensland. If Australia follows a pattern observed elsewhere in the world there might again be cases of DHF recorded on Australian soil.,"['McBride, J H']",['McBride JH'],,"['Cairns Base Hospital, Queensland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Australia,Aust Fam Physician,Australian family physician,0326701,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/transmission', 'Disease Outbreaks/prevention & control/statistics & numerical data', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Severe Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Survival Rate']",,1999/05/20 00:00,1999/05/20 00:01,['1999/05/20 00:00'],"['1999/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Aust Fam Physician. 1999 Apr;28(4):319-23.,4,,,,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antibody titres were compared with titres determined by the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. The results of the study showed that, besides being more simple to perform, the DEIA is in order of magnitude more sensitive than the HI test. Furthermore, the data suggest that it is possible to use a single dilution as a cutoff point to predict with reasonable accuracy, if a patient has had a recent dengue infection. The DEIA test for antibodies to dengue virus is an appropriate technology highly suitable for rapid diagnosis and surveillance in developing countries.","['Cardosa, M J', 'Noor Sham, S', 'Tio, P H', 'Lim, S S']","['Cardosa MJ', 'Noor Sham S', 'Tio PH', 'Lim SS']",,"['School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,The Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health,0266303,,IM,"['Dengue/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Dengue Virus/*isolation & purification', 'Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests', 'Humans', '*Immunoblotting']",,1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health. 1988 Dec;19(4):591-4.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: The following items were considered: human resources, uniforms, field materials, individual protection equipment, spraying equipment, strategic supplies (insecticides and larvicides), and vehicles. The costs associated with laboratory tests for entomological surveillance and dengue fever diagnosis were also calculated, as well as costs relating to information and printed materials for educational campaigns. RESULTS: The total direct costs of the City of Sao Paulo Dengue Fever Program in 2005 were R$ 21,774,282.82 (US$ 12,486,941.34 considering the dollar/real exchange rate in December 2009). Of this amount, 59.4% were directed to human resources, 38.3% to epidemic control measures, and 2.2% to capital expenditure. The cost per capita was R$ 1.99 in 2005. CONCLUSIONS: The control of dengue fever is essential given the growth of epidemics. Knowledge about the costs of strategies and priority items employed in dengue fever control and prevention programs can guide decision-making regarding the application of budget resources in both the City of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole.","['Taliberti, Helena', 'Zucchi, Paola']","['Taliberti H', 'Zucchi P']",,['Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo.'],['por'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Rev Panam Salud Publica,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,9705400,,IM,"['Brazil', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Dengue/*economics/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Preventive Health Services/*economics', 'Urban Health']",,2010/04/24 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/04/24 06:00'],"['2009/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S1020-49892010000300004 [pii]', '10.1590/s1020-49892010000300004 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Panam Salud Publica. 2010 Mar;27(3):175-80. doi: 10.1590/s1020-49892010000300004.,3,,,,,,,,,Custos diretos do programa de prevencao e controle da dengue no Municipio de Sao Paulo em 2005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spread of disease has led to increased recognition of atypical manifestations apart from the classical clinical features of dengue infection. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study of admitted patients suspected to have dengue infection was conducted during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons in the year 2010. Patients who had serological confirmation of dengue infection were classified according to World Health Organization definitions of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. Clinical and biochemical parameters were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Out of 356 patients with suspected dengue fever enrolled in the study, 138 (39%) had serologically confirmed dengue infection. Eighty (58%) patients were males and 58 (42%) were females. Ninety-six (70%) patients had classical dengue fever while 42 (30%) had dengue hemorrhagic fever. The most common symptoms were headache (105, 76%), abdominal pain (87, 63%), vomiting (80, 58%), rash (36, 26%), and cutaneous hypersensitivity (22, 16%). Hemorrhagic manifestations were present in 55 (40%) patients. Atypical manifestations were recorded. Notably, 14% of patients had neurological involvement and 4% had acute hepatic failure. Overall mortality was 6% and all fatal cases were due to multi-organ failure. CONCLUSION: Dengue infection poses a huge burden to the health-care system; its spectrum ranges from mild self-limiting illness to severe fatal disease. It can have varied and multi-systemic manifestations which can go unrecognized. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for atypical manifestations.","['Karoli, Ritu', 'Fatima, Jalees', 'Siddiqi, Zeba', 'Kazmi, Khursheed I', 'Sultania, Amit R']","['Karoli R', 'Fatima J', 'Siddiqi Z', 'Kazmi KI', 'Sultania AR']",,"[""Era's Lucknow Medical College, Sarfarazganj, Hardoi Road, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. ritu.karoli@rediffmail.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120723,Italy,J Infect Dev Ctries,Journal of infection in developing countries,101305410,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dengue/diagnosis/mortality/*pathology', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'India', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Serologic Tests', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,2012/07/31 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/07/31 06:00'],"['2011/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3855/jidc.2010 [doi]'],epublish,J Infect Dev Ctries. 2012 Jul 23;6(7):551-4. doi: 10.3855/jidc.2010.,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was originally confined to tropical and subtropical areas, but it is now present in other regions, such as Argentina. Epidemic outbreaks have been observed in the City of Buenos Aires since 2008, with few reports in children. OBJECTIVE: To analyze and compare the clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and evolutionary characteristics of the latest 2 dengue outbreaks outside the endemic area. POPULATION AND METHODS: Time-series study. Patients under 18 years of age with probable or confirmed dengue and evaluated in a children's hospital of the City of Buenos Aires during the periods 2015-2016 and 2019-2020 were included. RESULTS: A total of 239 patients were included; 29 (12%) had a history of travel. Their median age was 132 months (interquartile range: 102- 156). All had a fever. Other symptoms included headache in 170 (71%), myalgia in 129 (54%), and rash in 122 (51%). Forty patients (17%) had comorbidities. Warning signs were observed in 79 patients (33%); 14 (6%) developed severe dengue; 115 (45%) were hospitalized; none died. DENV-1 was the most common serotype. A history of travel and hospitalization prevailed in the first period; severe dengue and prior infection, in the second period. CONCLUSIONS: No patient died due to dengue in either study period. Statistically significant differences were observed in the frequency of hospitalization; a history of travel was more common in the 2015-2016 period and severe dengue, in the 2019-2020 period.","['Berberian, Griselda', 'Perez, Guadalupe', 'Mangano, Andrea', 'Borgnia, Daniela', 'Buchovsky, Ana', 'Costa, Marina', 'Fabbri, Cintia', 'Luppo, Victoria', 'Mistchenko, Alicia S', 'Deschutter, Veronica', 'Botana, Claudia', 'Martiren, Soledad', 'Brizuela, Martin', 'Arias, Ana P', 'Rosanova, Maria T']","['Berberian G', 'Perez G', 'Mangano A', 'Borgnia D', 'Buchovsky A', 'Costa M', 'Fabbri C', 'Luppo V', 'Mistchenko AS', 'Deschutter V', 'Botana C', 'Martiren S', 'Brizuela M', 'Arias AP', 'Rosanova MT']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8610-7284', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5771-9353', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6273-7628', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1325-8938', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0755-7237', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3285-7602', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1838-7349', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7587-0084', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2113-449X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2195-7779', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6503-0185']","['Servicio de Infectologia y Epidemiologia, Hospital de Pediatria Prof. Dr. Juan P.

Simultaneous reports of travellers with dengue returning from Luanda, Angola, to six countries on four continents suggest that a major dengue outbreak is currently occurring in Angola, South West Africa. METHODS: To identify the origin of the imported dengue virus, we sequenced the virus from Angola and investigated the interconnectivity via air travel between dengue-endemic countries and Angola. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Our analyses show that the Angola outbreak was most likely caused by an endemic virus strain that had been circulating in West Africa for many years. We also show that Portugal and South Africa are most likely at the highest risk of importation of dengue from Angola due to the large number of air passengers between Angola and these countries.","['Sessions, October M', 'Khan, Kamran', ""Hou, Yan'an"", 'Meltzer, Eyal', 'Quam, Mikkel', 'Schwartz, Eli', 'Gubler, Duane J', 'Wilder-Smith, Annelies']","['Sessions OM', 'Khan K', 'Hou Y', 'Meltzer E', 'Quam M', 'Schwartz E', 'Gubler DJ', 'Wilder-Smith A']",,"['Program in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS, Singapore. october.sessions@duke-nus.edu.sg']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130802,United States,Glob Health Action,Global health action,101496665,,IM,"['Angola/epidemiology', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/transmission', 'Dengue Virus/genetics', 'Disease Outbreaks/*statistics & numerical data', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Travel']",PMC3733016,2013/08/06 06:00,2014/02/01 06:00,['2013/08/06 06:00'],"['2013/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['21822 [pii]', '10.3402/gha.v6i0.21822 [doi]']",epublish,Glob Health Action. 2013 Aug 2;6:21822. doi: 10.3402/gha.v6i0.21822.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Angola', 'dengue', 'dengue in Africa', 'dengue sequence', 'international travel']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 125 children (aged 5 to 12 years old) with acute febrile syndrome with no apparent etiology. Paired serologic tests and/or viral culture were performed and dengue infection was confirmed in 40 patients and ruled out in 68 (17 indefinite cases). Early clinical manifestations (within the first 4 days of the disease) in the groups with dengue and other causes of febrile syndrome were compared. Independent indicators of dengue were determined in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: When clinical manifestations and complete blood count were considered, the independent indicators of dengue were: absence of nasal discharge, facial flushing, and leukocyte count < or = 4,500/.l. With at least two of these findings, a sensitivity of 67 % and a specificity of 72 % for the diagnosis of dengue were obtained. When coagulation tests were considered, a model for diagnosis was composed of: absence of nasal discharge, leukocyte count < or = 4500/.l, prothrombin time > 14 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time > 29 seconds. Two of these findings suggested a diagnosis of dengue with a sensitivity of 90 % and a specificity of 52.9 %. With at least 3 findings, specificity increased to 89.7 % and sensitivity decreased to 50 %. The presence of the four components of this latter model shows a specificity of 100 %. CONCLUSIONS: Some clinical manifestations and simple laboratory tests could aid the early detection of dengue infection in children.","['Diaz-Quijano, F A', 'Villar-Centeno, L A', 'Martinez-Vega, R A']","['Diaz-Quijano FA', 'Villar-Centeno LA', 'Martinez-Vega RA']",,"['Centro de Investigaciones Epidemiologicas, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Ctra. 32 no. 29-31, Bucaramanga, Colombia. fre_diazq@yahoo.com']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Spain,An Pediatr (Barc),"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",101162596,,IM,"['Child', 'Dengue/blood/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Prospective Studies']",,2006/06/24 09:00,2006/09/15 09:00,['2006/06/24 09:00'],"['2006/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['13089916 [pii]', '10.1157/13089916 [doi]']",ppublish,An Pediatr (Barc). 2006 Jun;64(6):523-9. doi: 10.1157/13089916.,6,,,,,,,,,Indicadores tempranos de infeccion por dengue en ninos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kaohsiung City is responsible for most of the dengue cases in Taiwan. Thus, this study aims to identify major factors involved in the prevalence of dengue fever by analyzing the epidemiological and clinical characteristics, and to establish associations between weather parameters and dengue occurrence in this City. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted with 3,322 confirmed dengue cases. Appropriate statistical methods were used to compare differences and correlations between dengue occurrence and demographic, clinical and weather parameters. RESULTS: The outbreak of dengue fever was found to be initiated by imported cases of dengue viruses from other endemic countries. Most of the confirmed cases were not reported to the health authority during the first visit to a doctor, and it took a median of 5 days after the appearance of the first syndromes for medical personnel to report suspected dengue cases. Accordingly, Aedes mosquitoes would have enough time to be infected and transmit the dengue virus. The diagnosis and notification criteria should not only include common symptoms of fever, myalgia, headache, skin rash and arthralgia, but should also be adjusted to include the most frequent symptoms of loss of appetite and feeling thirsty to shorten the notification time. Significantly positive correlations were found between the number of confirmed cases and weather parameters (i.e., temperature, rainfall and relative humidity) at a time lag of 1 month and 2 months. The predictive models for dengue occurrence using these three parameters at a 2-month lag time were established. CONCLUSIONS: The surveillance of imported cases, adjustment of notification criteria and application of climatic predictive models would be helpful in strengthening the dengue early warning surveillance system.","['Chang, Chiu-Jung', 'Chen, Colin S', 'Tien, Chien-Jung', 'Lu, Mei-Rou']","['Chang CJ', 'Chen CS', 'Tien CJ', 'Lu MR']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0818-3134'],"['Kaohsiung Municipal Kai-Syuan Psychiatric Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Kaohsiung Municipal Kai-Syuan Psychiatric Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180102,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Climate', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/pathology/prevention & control', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC5749826,2018/01/03 06:00,2018/02/22 06:00,['2018/01/03 06:00'],"['2017/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-17-31675 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0190637 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Jan 2;13(1):e0190637. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0190637. eCollection 2018.,1,,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exit.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report showed the clinical presentation of the 2019 outbreak in Bangladesh along with its comparison to previous outbreaks witnessed in this region. METHODS: This hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in one of the largest tertiary care hospitals in Dhaka city. A total of 553 laboratory-confirmed and 194 probable dengue cases were interviewed. The clinical manifestation of the confirmed cases of the current outbreak was compared with three of the outbreak reports retrieved from the databases. R version 3.6.3 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Among the confirmed cases, two-thirds were male (63.2%) and the average age was 27(+/- 11) years. Positive tests for NS1 and IgM were present in 99.6% (n = 525/527) and 82.6% (n = 38/46) of the cases, respectively. Thrombocytopenia was present in 66.1% of cases. Fever (100%) was common for all. Gastrointestinal (GIT) features, including abdominal pain (86.5%), anorexia and/or vomiting (69.6%), and Diarrhea (> 3 motions/day) (26.2%) were more frequent than typical rash and other pain symptoms. Hypotension was present in approximately a quarter of patients (25%). GIT features (anorexia, nausea, and/or vomiting) and hypotension were more common among adult participants while bleeding manifestation (melena and vaginal bleeding, p = 0.009 & 0.032) was more frequent in pediatric patients. Compared to outbreaks of 2008, 2016, and 2018, increasing trends in GIT symptoms e.g. anorexia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea were observed. While a negative trend in hemorrhagic manifestations (skin rash, melena, and conjunctival hemorrhage/hemorrhagic sclera) and arthralgia/joint pain were found. CONCLUSION: The present outbreak was noticeably characterized by GIT symptoms and hypotension in addition to the typical clinical features like rash and pain symptoms. An increasing trend in GIT features and decreasing trend in hemorrhagic manifestations was noted over the last decade of dengue outbreaks.","['Hasan, Mohammad Jahid', 'Tabassum, Tamanna', 'Sharif, Mohiuddin', 'Khan, Md Abdullah Saeed', 'Bipasha, Akhi Roy', 'Basher, Ariful', 'Islam, Mohammad Rafiqul', 'Amin, Mohammad Robed']","['Hasan MJ', 'Tabassum T', 'Sharif M', 'Khan MAS', 'Bipasha AR', 'Basher A', 'Islam MR', 'Amin MR']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9212-1739'],"['Pi Research Consultancy Center, Dhaka, Bangladesh. dr.jahid61@gmail.com.', 'Pi Research Consultancy Center, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'Department of Medicine, Dhaka Medical College and Hospital-2, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'Pi Research Consultancy Center, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'Pi Research Consultancy Center, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'BSMMU, OSD, Directorate General of Health Service, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'Department of Medicine, Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'Department of Medicine, Dhaka Medical College and Hospital-2, Dhaka, Bangladesh.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211029,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bangladesh/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Dengue/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Fever/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Young Adult']",PMC8555248,2021/10/31 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/10/30 05:22'],"['2020/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/10/30 05:22 [entrez]', '2021/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-021-06788-z [pii]', '6788 [pii]', '10.1186/s12879-021-06788-z [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2021 Oct 29;21(1):1113. doi: 10.1186/s12879-021-06788-z.,1,['(c) 2021.

It is known that the success of POCT usage is contingent on its implementation within the health system. We evaluated health services delivery and the Dengue Duo rapid diagnostic test kit application in Singapore from healthcare workers' perspectives and patient experiences of dengue at surge times. METHODS: Focus group discussions were conducted with dengue patients, from before and after the POCT implementation period. In-depth interviews with semi-structured components with healthcare workers were carried out. A patient centred process mapping technique was used for evaluation, which mapped the patient's journey and was mirrored from the healthcare worker's perspective. RESULTS: Patients and healthcare workers confirmed a wide range of symptoms in adults, making it challenging to determine diagnosis. There were multiple routes to help seeking, and no 'typical patient journey', with patients either presenting directly to the hospital emergency department, or being referred there by a primary care provider. Patients groups diagnosed before and after POCT implementation expressed some differences between speed of diagnoses and attitudes of doctors, yet shared negative feelings about waiting times and a lack of communication and poor information delivery. However, the POCT did not in its current implementation do much to help waiting times. Healthcare workers expressed that public perceptions of dengue in recent years was a major factor in changing patient management, and that the POCT kit was helpful in improving the speed and accuracy of diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Health service delivery for dengue patients in Singapore was overall perceived to be of an acceptable clinical standard, which was enhanced by the introduction of the POCT. However, improvements can be focused on Adapting to outbreaks by reducing and rendering Waiting experiences more comfortable; Advancing education about symptom recognition, while also Recognising better communication strategies; and Expanding follow-up care options. This is presented as the Dengue AWARE model of care delivery.","['Tan, Qinghui', 'Hildon, Zoe J-L', 'Singh, Shweta', 'Jing, Jin', 'Thein, Tun Linn', 'Coker, Richard', 'Vrijhoef, Hubertus J M', 'Leo, Yee Sin']","['Tan Q', 'Hildon ZJ', 'Singh S', 'Jing J', 'Thein TL', 'Coker R', 'Vrijhoef HJM', 'Leo YS']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2099-3719'],"['Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Tahir Foundation Building, Block MD1, 12 Science Drive 2, Singapore, 117549, Singapore. tan_qing_hui@brc.a-star.edu.sg.', 'Biological Resource Centre, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star), Singapore, Singapore. tan_qing_hui@brc.a-star.edu.sg.', 'Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Tahir Foundation Building, Block MD1, 12 Science Drive 2, Singapore, 117549, Singapore.', 'London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Centre for Communication Programs, 111 Market Place, Suite 310, Baltimore, Maryland, 21202, USA.', 'Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Tahir Foundation Building, Block MD1, 12 Science Drive 2, Singapore, 117549, Singapore.', 'Institute of Infectious Diseases & Epidemiology, Communicable Disease Centre; Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Moulmein Road, Singapore, 308433, Singapore.', 'Institute of Infectious Diseases & Epidemiology, Communicable Disease Centre; Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Moulmein Road, Singapore, 308433, Singapore.', 'London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Mahidol University, 9th Floor, Satharanaukwisit Bldg, 420/1 Rajwithi Rd, Bangkok, -10400, Thailand.', 'Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Tahir Foundation Building, Block MD1, 12 Science Drive 2, Singapore, 117549, Singapore.', 'National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Patient & Care, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, Netherlands.', 'Department of Family Medicine, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Tahir Foundation Building, Block MD1, 12 Science Drive 2, Singapore, 117549, Singapore.', 'Institute of Infectious Diseases & Epidemiology, Communicable Disease Centre; Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Moulmein Road, Singapore, 308433, Singapore.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170719,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', '*Delivery of Health Care', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', '*Health Personnel', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Point-of-Care Systems', 'Public Opinion', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic', 'Singapore/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",PMC5517990,2017/07/21 06:00,2017/10/17 06:00,['2017/07/21 06:00'],"['2016/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-017-2580-9 [pii]', '2580 [pii]', '10.1186/s12879-017-2580-9 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2017 Jul 19;17(1):503. doi: 10.1186/s12879-017-2580-9.,1,,['NOTNLM'],"['Dengue', 'Focus groups', 'Health personnel', 'Model of care delivery', 'Perception', 'Point-of-care testing']","[""ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: INsights into DEngue Survivors'"", 'Perception on HealTHcare Study (IN-DEPTH study) ref.: 2014/01295 was approved on', '3rd March 2015 by the Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB), Singapore.

METHODS: Cross sectional study that included children attended since January 18th to April 15th 2016 at Hospital de Ninos ""Dr. Ricardo Gutierrez"". RESULTS: among 156 registered cases, 82 confirmed cases by virology test; 130 (83 %) autochthonous cases. The most frequent clinical manifestations were fever, headache and retro-ocular pain. Laboratory abnormalities were leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and increased liver enzymes. Thirty-five children were hospitalized (23 %), 25 (16 %) with warning signs. In our study, no cases of severe dengue occurred. CONCLUSIONS: early recognition of warning signs and hematological monitoring is essential in order to detect patients at risk and offer them adequate early treatment.","['Cazes, Claudia I', 'Carballo, Carolina M', 'Praino, Maria L', 'Ferolla, Fausto M', 'Mistchenko, Alicia', 'Contrini, Maria M', 'Fallo, Aurelia', 'Lopez, Eduardo L']","['Cazes CI', 'Carballo CM', 'Praino ML', 'Ferolla FM', 'Mistchenko A', 'Contrini MM', 'Fallo A', 'Lopez EL']",,"['Programa de Infectologia Pediatrica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. clauinescazes@gmail.com.', 'Programa de Infectologia Pediatrica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Programa de Infectologia Pediatrica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Programa de Infectologia Pediatrica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Virologia, Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Comision de Investigaciones Cientificas de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (CIC), Argentina.', 'Programa de Infectologia Pediatrica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Programa de Infectologia Pediatrica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Programa de Infectologia Pediatrica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['spa'],['Journal Article'],,Argentina,Arch Argent Pediatr,Archivos argentinos de pediatria,0372460,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Argentina/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dengue/blood/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Urban Health', 'Young Adult']",,2019/01/18 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5546/aap.2019.e63 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Argent Pediatr. 2019 Feb 1;117(1):e63-e67. doi: 10.5546/aap.2019.e63.,1,['Sociedad Argentina de Pediatria.'],['NOTNLM'],"['dengue virus, child, pediatric']",,,,,,"Brote epidemico de dengue en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, 2016: caracteristicas clinicas y hematologicas de la infeccion en una poblacion pediatrica.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the costs considered are the medical costs necessary for the treatment of those affected and the opportunity costs for those who stopped working or studying because of the disease. In order to assess the costs of the disease, at the end of 2009 an ad-hoc survey was carried out in 201 households where people that had contracted dengue during the 2009 epidemic lived. The results allow us to estimate between 26 to 40 million Argentine pesos (6 to 9 million US dollars) as the total cost of the recorded cases. The regions in the north of Argentina bore the highest economic burden of the disease (more than 90% of the total burden). For all regions, the social cost of one dengue case accounts for more than 40% of the average monthly net individual income.","['Tarragona, Sonia', 'Monteverde, Malena', 'Marchioni, Silvia', 'Caporale, Joaquin', 'Pereiro, Ana Cristina', 'Palacios, Julio Maximiliano']","['Tarragona S', 'Monteverde M', 'Marchioni S', 'Caporale J', 'Pereiro AC', 'Palacios JM']",,"['Fundacion Mundo Sano, Argentina. starragona@mundosano.org']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Argentina,Salud Colect,Salud colectiva,101276038,,IM,"['Argentina/epidemiology', '*Cost of Illness', 'Dengue/*economics/epidemiology/therapy', 'Epidemics/*economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Models, Economic']",,2013/09/03 06:00,2014/07/12 06:00,['2013/09/03 06:00'],"['2012/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S1851-82652012000200004 [pii]', '10.1590/S1851-82652012000200004 [doi]']",ppublish,Salud Colect. 2012 May-Aug;8(2):151-62. doi: 10.1590/S1851-82652012000200004.,2,,,,,,,,,Dengue en la Argentina: un analisis economico del impacto de la epidemia de 2009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For all three serotypes, we estimated that the introduction of new lineages occurred within 7 to 10-year intervals. New lineages were most likely to be imported from the Caribbean region to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, and then to disperse at a rate of approximately 0.5 km/day. Joint statistical analysis of evolutionary, epidemiological and ecological data indicates that aerial transportation of humans and/or vector mosquitoes, rather than Aedes aegypti infestation rates or geographical distances, determine dengue virus spread in Brazil.","['Nunes, Marcio R T', 'Palacios, Gustavo', 'Faria, Nuno Rodrigues', 'Sousa, Edivaldo Costa Jr', 'Pantoja, Jamilla A', 'Rodrigues, Sueli G', 'Carvalho, Valeria L', 'Medeiros, Daniele B A', 'Savji, Nazir', 'Baele, Guy', 'Suchard, Marc A', 'Lemey, Philippe', 'Vasconcelos, Pedro F C', 'Lipkin, W Ian']","['Nunes MR', 'Palacios G', 'Faria NR', 'Sousa EC Jr', 'Pantoja JA', 'Rodrigues SG', 'Carvalho VL', 'Medeiros DB', 'Savji N', 'Baele G', 'Suchard MA', 'Lemey P', 'Vasconcelos PF', 'Lipkin WI']",,"['Centro de Inovacao Tecnologica, Instituto Evandro Chagas, Ananindeua, Brazil.', 'Center for Genomic Sciences, United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases, Frederick, Maryland, United States of America; Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Centro de Inovacao Tecnologica, Instituto Evandro Chagas, Ananindeua, Brazil.', 'Centro de Inovacao Tecnologica, Instituto Evandro Chagas, Ananindeua, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Arbovirologia e Febres Hemorragicas, Instituto Evandro Chagas, Ananindeua, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Arbovirologia e Febres Hemorragicas, Instituto Evandro Chagas, Ananindeua, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Arbovirologia e Febres Hemorragicas, Instituto Evandro Chagas, Ananindeua, Brazil.', 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Biomathematics, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California - Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America; Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California - Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America; Department of Biostatistics, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, University of California - Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Departamento de Arbovirologia e Febres Hemorragicas, Instituto Evandro Chagas, Ananindeua, Brazil; Universidade do Estado do Para, Belem, Para, Brazil.', 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20140417,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['*Air Travel', 'Animals', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*transmission/virology', 'Dengue Virus/classification/*isolation & purification', 'Humans']",PMC3990485,2014/04/20 06:00,2014/10/31 06:00,['2014/04/19 06:00'],"['2013/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['PNTD-D-13-01776 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0002769 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2014 Apr 17;8(4):e2769. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002769. eCollection 2014 Apr.,4,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,"['R01 GM086887/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG006139/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Literature search and communication with researchers. RESULTS: Case reports of dengue during pregnancy, the peripartum period and neonatal dengue were found. There is little systematic research. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy appears not to increase the incidence or severity of dengue, but some case reports suggest that dengue may predispose to certain pregnancy complications. Transplacental infection occurs, but protective antibodies pass transplacentally and fetal effects may be minimal given sufficient immune response. In near-term disease, severe fetal or neonatal illness and death may occur. Such illness may also predispose the newborn to subsequent dengue hemorrhagic fever. Clinicians should be aware that presentation in either maternal or neonatal disease may be atypical and confound diagnosis. Women in late pregnancy should avoid travel to areas of ongoing disease, and those earlier in pregnancy should consider dengue a serious hazard. If travel is unavoidable, mosquito avoidance measures are mandated. If a woman acquires dengue fever while pregnant, conservative medical and obstetrical management are the treatments of choice.

Recent studies have shown dengue viral infection causing encephalopathy, with high morbidity and mortality. Dengue encephalopathy patients usually present with altered sensorium, elevated lab parameters and high antibody titres at the time of admission. Dengue infection was very common and virulent in Hadoti region during August to November 2017 and many patients presented with encephalopathy. AIMS: To study the clinical presentation, lab parameters and other diagnostic features, management and outcome of patients of dengue fever with encephalopathy in Hadoti region in August to November 2017. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was done in Govt Medical college Hospital Kota and other multi-speciality hospitals of Kota. Study population comprised of 60 patients presenting with febrile illness and thrombocytopenia, serologically proved to be having Dengue fever. Among these 60 patients, 30 patients had encephalopathy who presented with altered sensorium, seizures or any other neurological symptoms and remaining 30 had no signs and symptoms of encephalopathy. RESULTS: Among 30 patients with encephalopathy and positive serology (NS1/IgM/ IgG), fever and altered sensorium was most common symptom, while amongst patients without encephalopathy fever with chills and generalised bodyache was more common clinical feature. Convulsions and respiratory distress were very common among encephalopathy patients. Out of 30 encephalopathy patients 16 patients (53%) had convulsions, 14 (46%) had respiratory distress, 17(56%) had shock and 3 patients (10%) had hemiplegia. 2 patients also had visual blurring and dysarthria. Mean duration between appearance of fever and altered sensorium was 4.6 (+/-2.1) days. Most of patients with encephalopathy had deranged hepatic (bilirubin, SGOT, SGPT), renal (urea, creatinine, decreased urine output) and coagulation parameters (PT/INR, bleeding manifestations). 9 (30%) patients died and 21(70%) patients improved with complete recovery (except 3 hemiplegic patients). CONCLUSION: Increased incidence of dengue fever with encephalopathy in the recent years, in the absence of single sensitive test for detecting dengue encephalopathy, variable CSF and MRI Brain features, and associated high morbidity and mortality poses a big problem for clinician. This study may be helpful in focussing on early diagnosis and aggressive initial management which can influence final outcome.","['Saluja, Manoj', 'Swami, Yogesh Kumar', 'Chittora, Saurabh', 'Vimlani, Hemant']","['Saluja M', 'Swami YK', 'Chittora S', 'Vimlani H']",,"['Professor, Govt.

Long-term protection induced by low levels of type-specific neutralizing antibodies can be assessed using the virus-neutralizing antibody test. However, this test is laborious and time-consuming. In this study, a blockade-of-binding enzyme-linked immunoassay was developed to assess antibody activity by using a set of neutralizing anti-E monoclonal antibodies and blood samples from dengue virus-infected or -immunized macaques. Diluted blood samples were incubated with plate-bound dengue virus particles before the addition of an enzyme-conjugated antibody specific to the epitope of interest. Based on blocking reference curves constructed using autologous purified antibodies, sample blocking activity was determined as the relative concentration of unconjugated antibody that resulted in the same percent signal reduction. In separate DENV-1-, -2-, -3-, and -4-related sets of samples, moderate to strong correlations of the blocking activity with neutralizing antibody titers were found with the four type-specific antibodies 1F4, 3H5, 8A1, and 5H2, respectively. Significant correlations were observed for single samples taken 1 month after infection as well as samples drawn before and at various time points after infection/immunization. Similar testing using a cross-reactive EDE-1 antibody revealed a moderate correlation between the blocking activity and the neutralizing antibody titer only for the DENV-2-related set. The potential usefulness of the blockade-of-binding activity as a correlative marker of neutralizing antibodies against dengue viruses needs to be validated in humans. IMPORTANCE This study describes a blockade-of-binding assay for the determination of antibodies that recognize a selected set of serotype-specific or group-reactive epitopes in the envelope of dengue virus. By employing blood samples collected from dengue virus-infected or -immunized macaques, moderate to strong correlations of the epitope-blocking activities with the virus-neutralizing antibody titers were observed with serotype-specific blocking activities for each of the four dengue serotypes. This simple, rapid, and less laborious method should be useful for the evaluation of antibody responses to dengue virus infection and may serve as, or be a component of, an in vitro correlate of protection against dengue in the future.","['Keelapang, Poonsook', 'Kraivong, Romchat', 'Pulmanausahakul, Rojjanaporn', 'Sriburi, Rungtawan', 'Prompetchara, Eakachai', 'Kaewmaneephong, Jutamart',

Most importantly the outbreak of 2017 caused 70 deaths, about 121,083 suspected and 24,938 confirmed cases in 23 districts of KP. In 2018, an abrupt decline in suspected and confirmed dengue cases was observed and 2018 was declared as dengue outbreak free. This study characterizes and explores the control and response measure activities of the outbreak. In addition, we explored the challenges faced and lessons learned for control of future dengue outbreaks from the perspectives of health authorities and dengue response staff in the KP province of Pakistan. METHODS: This was a mixed methods study with quantitative data on dengue outbreaks obtained from health department in KP followed by qualitative study to explore activities and responses that enabled the Dengue Response Unit (DRU) for a successful dengue outbreak control in 2018. In-depth interviews were conducted with the key informants from the department of health and the dengue response unit. RESULTS: The quantitative data analysis revealed a huge decline of suspected and confirmed dengue cases in comparison with the previous year in most of the KP districts.

In light of this, the government of Tamil Nadu has adopted a decentralized dengue screening strategy at the primary healthcare (PHC) facilities using blood platelet count. Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of a decentralized screening strategy for dengue at PHC facilities compared with the current strategy at the tertiary health facility (THC) level. METHODS: Decision tree analysis followed a hypothetical cohort of 1000 suspected dengue cases entering the model. The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed at a 3% discount rate for the proposed and current strategy. The outcomes are expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per quality-adjusted life years gained. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were done to check the uncertainty in the outcome. RESULTS: The proposed strategy was found to be cost-saving and ICER was estimated to be -41 197. PSA showed that the proposed strategy had a 0.84 probability of being an economically dominant strategy. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed strategy is cost-saving, however, it is recommended to consider optimal population coverage, costs to economic human resources and collateral benefits of equipment.","['Muniyandi, Malaisamy', 'Karikalan, Nagarajan', 'Ravi, Karunya', 'Sengodan, Senthilkumar', 'Krishnan, Rajendran', 'Tyagi, Kirti', 'Rajsekar, Kavitha', 'Raju, Sivadhas', 'Selvavinayagam, T S']","['Muniyandi M', 'Karikalan N', 'Ravi K', 'Sengodan S', 'Krishnan R', 'Tyagi K', 'Rajsekar K', 'Raju S', 'Selvavinayagam TS']",,"['Scientist-D & Head, Department of Health Economics, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, No. 1, Sathyamoorthy Road, Chetpet, Chennai 60003, India.', 'Scientist-D & Head, Department of Health Economics, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, No. 1, Sathyamoorthy Road, Chetpet, Chennai 60003, India.', 'Scientist-D & Head, Department of Health Economics, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, No. 1, Sathyamoorthy Road, Chetpet, Chennai 60003, India.', 'Scientist-D & Head, Department of Health Economics, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, No. 1, Sathyamoorthy Road, Chetpet, Chennai 60003, India.', 'Scientist-D & Head, Department of Health Economics, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, No. 1, Sathyamoorthy Road, Chetpet, Chennai 60003, India.', 'Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 2nd Floor, IRCS Building, 1, Red Cross Road, New Delhi 110001, India.', 'Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 2nd Floor, IRCS Building, 1, Red Cross Road, New Delhi 110001, India.', 'Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Government of Tamil Nadu, 359, Anna Salai, Chokkalingam Nagar, Teynampet, Chennai 600006, India.', 'Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Government of Tamil Nadu, 359, Anna Salai, Chokkalingam Nagar, Teynampet, Chennai 600006, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int Health,International health,101517095,,IM,"['Cost-Benefit Analysis', '*Dengue/diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'India', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', '*Vector Borne Diseases']",PMC9070504,2021/08/29 06:00,2022/05/10 06:00,['2021/08/28 17:04'],"['2021/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/10 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/28 17:04 [entrez]']","['6359249 [pii]', 'ihab045 [pii]', '10.1093/inthealth/ihab045 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Health. 2022 May 2;14(3):295-308. doi: 10.1093/inthealth/ihab045.,3,"['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

It is estimated that the disease manifests only in 90 million cases out of the total 390 million yearly infections. Even though research has not yet elucidated which are the precise pathophysiological mechanisms that trigger severe forms of dengue, the infection elicits a critical immune response significant for dengue pathogenesis development. Understanding how the immune response to DENV is established and how it can resolve the infection or turn into an immunopathology is of great importance in DENV research. Currently, studies have extensively debated 2 hypotheses involving immune response: antibody-dependent enhancement and cytokine storm. However, despite its undeniable importance in severe forms of the disease, these 2 hypotheses are based on a primed immune status resulting from previous heterologous infection, abstaining them from explaining the severe forms of dengue in naive immune subjects, for example. Thus, it seems that a more intricate arrangement of causes and conditions must be achieved to severe dengue to occur. Among them, the cytokine network signature elicited, in association with viral aspects deserves special attention regarding the establishment of infection and evolution to pathogenesis. In this work, we intend to shed light on how those elements contribute to severe dengue development.","['Kuczera, Diogo', 'Assolini, Joao Paulo', 'Tomiotto-Pellissier, Fernanda', 'Pavanelli, Wander Rogerio', 'Silveira, Guilherme Ferreira']","['Kuczera D', 'Assolini JP', 'Tomiotto-Pellissier F', 'Pavanelli WR', 'Silveira GF']",,"['1 Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Instituto Carlos Chagas , ICC/Fiocruz/PR, Curitiba, Brazil .', '2 Departamento de Ciencias Patologicas, Centro de Ciencias Biologicas , Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Londrina, Brazil .', '2 Departamento de Ciencias Patologicas, Centro de Ciencias Biologicas , Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Londrina, Brazil .', '2 Departamento de Ciencias Patologicas, Centro de Ciencias Biologicas , Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Londrina, Brazil .', '1 Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Instituto Carlos Chagas , ICC/Fiocruz/PR, Curitiba, Brazil .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Enhancement/*immunology', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'Dengue/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'Humans']",,2018/02/15 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2018/02/15 06:00'],"['2018/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jir.2017.0037 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2018 Feb;38(2):69-80. doi: 10.1089/jir.2017.0037.,2,,['NOTNLM'],"['ADE', 'NS1', 'cytokine', 'cytokine storm', 'dengue', 'innate immunity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its manifestations range from asymptomatic infections to severe disease. Although cardiac involvement has been reported in DVI, its incidence has not yet been well established. METHODS: From July 2016 to January 2018, patients hospitalized at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Thailand, with dengue virus infection confirmed by positive NS1 or positive dengue immunoglobulin M findings, participated in the study. We characterized the incidence and change in cardiac function by serial echocardiography and levels of troponin-T and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) on the day of admission, the day of defervescence, the first day of hypotension (if any), and at 2 week follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 81 patients evaluated, 6 (7.41%) exhibited elevated biomarker levels. There was no difference in clinical presentation amongst dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), except for the amount of bleeding. Cardiac involvement was found in 22.2% of patients: 3 (3.70%) had left ventricular systolic dysfunction, 3 (3.70%) had transient diastolic dysfunction, 6 (7.41%) had increased levels of at least one cardiac biomarker (troponin-T or CK-MB), and 6 (7.41%) had small pericardial effusion. Myocarditis was suspected in only two patients (with DHF); thus, myocarditis was uncommon in patients with dengue virus infection. Three patients developed DSS during admission and were transferred to the intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: Cardiac involvement in adults with dengue infection was common, ranging from elevated cardiac biomarker to myocarditis. Abnormalities in cardiac function had resolved spontaneously by the day of follow-up, without specific treatment. We found that DHF was a significant risk factor for cardiac involvement. Echocardiography is the investigation of choice for evaluating the haemodynamic status of patients with DVI, especially in severe dengue.","['Mansanguan, Chayasin', 'Hanboonkunupakarn, Borimas', 'Muangnoicharoen, Sant', 'Huntrup, Arun', 'Poolcharoen, Akkapon', 'Mansanguan, Suyanee', 'Piyaphanee, Watcharapong', 'Phumratanaprapin, Weerapong']","['Mansanguan C', 'Hanboonkunupakarn B', 'Muangnoicharoen S', 'Huntrup A', 'Poolcharoen A', 'Mansanguan S', 'Piyaphanee W', 'Phumratanaprapin W']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7852-626X'],"['Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. chayasin.man@mahidol.ac.th.', 'Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210910,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,,IM,"['Adult', '*Cardiomyopathies', '*Dengue/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology', 'Echocardiography', 'Heart', 'Humans', '*Myocarditis']",PMC8431916,2021/09/12 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2021/09/11 05:20'],"['2020/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/11 05:20 [entrez]', '2021/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-021-06639-x [pii]', '6639 [pii]', '10.1186/s12879-021-06639-x [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2021 Sep 10;21(1):940. doi: 10.1186/s12879-021-06639-x.,1,['(c) 2021.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze clinical and laboratory data as predicitve factors of dengue diagnosis at Evandro Chagas Clinical Research Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, during the 2001-2002 dengue outbreak in Rio de Janeiro. METHODS: Cross sectional study comparing clinical laboratory data collected from the National Information System for Compulsory Notification Diseases (SINAN) in two serologically confirmed groups: dengue D (N = 453) and non-dengue ND (N = 80). RESULTS: Fever, exanthema, itching, mean platelet count < 150,000, WBC count < 4,000 and absence of vomiting and of abdominal pain help to distinguish D from ND groups. When considered individually, these signs and symptoms enhance diagnostic sensitivity and, when used in combination, improve specificity. CONCLUSION: A combination of symptoms not necessarily considered indicative of dengue diagnosis could improve surveillance and medical decision-making in simple clinical settings.","['Passos, S R L', 'Bedoya, S J', 'Hokerberg, Y H M', 'Maia, S C', 'Georg, I', 'Nogueira, R M R', 'Souza, R V', 'Marzochi, K B F']","['Passos SR', 'Bedoya SJ', 'Hokerberg YH', 'Maia SC', 'Georg I', 'Nogueira RM', 'Souza RV', 'Marzochi KB']",,"['Clinical Epidemiology Laboratory, Evandro Chagas Clinical Research Institute, Av Brasil 4365 Manguinhos, Rio de Janeiro, 21045900, Brazil. sonialambert@ipec.fiocruz.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081119,Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Biomarkers', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Clinical Laboratory Techniques', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Dengue Virus', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2008/11/21 09:00,2009/03/18 09:00,['2008/11/21 09:00'],"['2007/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/11/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/11/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s15010-008-7334-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Infection. 2008 Dec;36(6):570-4. doi: 10.1007/s15010-008-7334-6.

This is due to the high prevalence of dengue fever in these regions and the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic situation. The similarity of symptoms between the two diseases can confuse diagnoses, but coinfection can also occur. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two cases of patients with dengue and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 coinfection. The first case is that of a 24-year-old Hispanic woman with acute fever, odynophagia, and diarrhea, without respiratory symptoms and with positive molecular tests for both dengue and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The second case is that of a 59-year-old Hispanic male patient with fever and respiratory symptoms of 2 weeks duration, negative molecular tests, and positive serological tests for both viruses. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of both viral infections can help elucidate diagnoses and prognoses. CONCLUSIONS: Severe dengue infection is common in young adults, while coronavirus disease 2019 is generally asymptomatic. In older people, the severity of dengue fever will depend on their comorbidities or the infectious serotype, but coronavirus disease 2019 is consistently more severe in this group. The accurate diagnosis of both infections can better guide clinical management, as well as public health actions in transmission control, now especially important during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","['Agudelo Rojas, Olga Lucia', 'Tello-Cajiao, Maria Elena', 'Rosso, Fernando']","['Agudelo Rojas OL', 'Tello-Cajiao ME', 'Rosso F']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5250-2801'],"['Fundacion Valle del Lili, Centro de Investigaciones Clinicas (CIC), Cali, Colombia.', 'Fundacion Valle del Lili, Centro de Investigaciones Clinicas (CIC), Cali, Colombia.', 'Fundacion Valle del Lili, Centro de Investigaciones Clinicas (CIC), Cali, Colombia. fernando.rosso@fvl.org.co.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Infectious Disease Service, Fundacion Valle del Lili, Cali, Valle del Cauca, Colombia. fernando.rosso@fvl.org.co.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210830,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*COVID-19', '*Coinfection/diagnosis', '*Dengue/complications/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pandemics', 'SARS-CoV-2', '*Severe Dengue', 'Young Adult']",PMC8404025,2021/09/01 06:00,2021/09/07 06:00,['2021/08/31 05:42'],"['2020/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/31 05:42 [entrez]', '2021/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-021-02973-5 [pii]', '2973 [pii]', '10.1186/s13256-021-02973-5 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2021 Aug 30;15(1):439. doi: 10.1186/s13256-021-02973-5.,1,['(c) 2021.

A system of ordinary differential equations was proposed, describing the dynamics and their evolution as determined by numerical simulation. Different mechanical control and prophylaxis strategies were compared to the situation without control. The basic reproduction number R(0) was determined R(0) to show that if R(0) > 1 there would be a risk of an epidemic and otherwise the disease would have low impact levels. The basic reproduction number helps determine the dynamics' future pattern and contrast the results so obtained with those obtained numerically. It was concluded that although prophylaxis and mechanical control alone provide effective results in controlling the disease, if both controls are combined then infection levels become significantly reduced. Around 60 % mechanical control and prevention levels are needed to provide suitable results in controlling dengue outbreaks.","['Toro-Zapata, Hernan D', 'Restrepo, Leonardo D', 'Vergano-Salazar, Juan G', 'Munoz-Loaiza, Anibal']","['Toro-Zapata HD', 'Restrepo LD', 'Vergano-Salazar JG', 'Munoz-Loaiza A']",,"['Departamento de Matematicas, Facultad de Educacion, Universidad del Quindio, Armenia, Colombia. hdtoro@uniquindio.edu.co']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Colombia,Rev Salud Publica (Bogota),"Revista de salud publica (Bogota, Colombia)",100936348,,IM,"['Aedes', 'Animals', 'Communicable Disease Control/*methods', 'Dengue/epidemiology/prevention & control/*transmission', 'Disease Outbreaks/prevention & control', '*Endemic Diseases', 'Humans', 'Insect Vectors', '*Models, Biological', 'Mosquito Control', 'Population Density']",,2011/10/28 06:00,2012/05/30 06:00,['2011/10/28 06:00'],"['2010/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",['S0124-00642010000600014 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Salud Publica (Bogota). 2010 Dec;12(6):1020-32.,6,,,,,,,,,Dinamica de transmision del Dengue clasico con control mecanico y profilaxis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years this disease has extended to rural areas also due to rapid urbanization. In Tamil Nadu, fever outbreaks were reported in two villages of Dharmapuri district during May and September 2001 with clinical symptoms suggestive of dengue fever. Epidemiological, virological and entomological investigations were carried out in these two villages to ascertain the etiology of the outbreaks. METHODS: Paired serum samples were collected from febrile patients clinically suspected to have dengue and were tested for the presence of IgM antibodies to dengue virus by MAC ELISA. Samples were also tested by Dengue Duo IgM/IgG rapid strip. Surveys of larval and adult Aedes mosquitoes were carried out before and after anti-larval and anti-adult measures were implemented. Female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes collected in Mampatti village were tested individually for the presence of dengue-2 viral antigen by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). In addition, two pools of female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were tested for the presence of dengue viral antigen by ELISA and then subjected to Toxo-IFA system for demonstration of dengue virus. RESULTS: A total of 124 and 267 fever cases with clinical symptoms and signs suggestive of dengue were reported in Kadumuchandiram and Mampatti villages of Dharmapuri district, respectively. Serodiagnosis revealed that 13 of 31 and 14 of 52 patients tested were positive for dengue-2 virus by MAC ELISA in Kadumuchandiram and Mampatti villages respectively. Dengue Duo rapid strip test also detected 14 (of 31 tested) patients positive for dengue virus specific IgM antibodies in Kadumuchandiram village and 8 (of 12 tested) in Mampatti village. Application of temephos and fogging with pyrethrum 2 per cent extract were found to be effective against immatures and adults respectively. Both the pools of Ae. aegypti tested for the presence of dengue viral antigen were positive by ELISA and one mosquito (tested individually) was positive by IIFA. Supernatants of two pools were found to be positive for dengue-2 virus by Toxo-IFA. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Virological and serological investigations confirmed that the outbreaks of fever were due to dengue virus infection. High breeding of Ae. aegypti in the study villages, detection of dengue-2 viral antigen and isolation of dengue-2 virus in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes confirmed the etiology.","['Victor, T John', 'Malathi, M', 'Gurusamy, D', 'Desai, Anita', 'Ravi, V', 'Narayanasamy, G', 'Anuradha, L', 'Rani, C', 'Krishnamurthy, P']","['Victor TJ', 'Malathi M', 'Gurusamy D', 'Desai A', 'Ravi V', 'Narayanasamy G', 'Anuradha L', 'Rani C', 'Krishnamurthy P']",,"['Institute of Vector Control & Zoonoses, Hosur, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,,IM,"['Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male']",,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/04/17 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2002 Oct;116:133-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aim to study effect of malaria co-infection on clinical outcomes of dengue infection. METHODS: Records of 623 children with dengue infection, based on NS-1 antigen and IgM ELISA testing, were collected. Malaria co-infection was identified in 20 cases, based on peripheral blood smear examination. Clinical and hematological parameters were compared in two groups (malaria co-infection vs. dengue mono-infection). RESULTS: Duration of hospitalization was significantly higher in co-infected group. Significantly higher proportion of malaria co-infection cases had hepatosplenomegaly, hemoglobin </=8 g/dl, serum albumin </=3 g/dl, serum bilirubin >/=1 mg/dl, serum aspartate aminotransferase >/=500 U/l and serum alanine aminotransferase >/=300 U/l. Number of transfusions (PRBC and platelets) required in malaria co-infection group was higher. CONCLUSION: Malaria co-infection in dengue impacts clinical presentation, hematological parameters, requirement of blood transfusion and morbidity.

It is transmitted to the man by mosquitoes (Aedes) and exists in two forms: Dengue Fever and Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever. The disease can be contracted by one of the four different viruses. Moreover, immunity is acquired only to the serotype contracted and a contact with a second serotype becomes more dangerous. METHODS: The present paper deals with a succession of two epidemics caused by two different viruses. The dynamics of the disease is studied by a compartmental model involving ordinary differential equations for the human and the mosquito populations. RESULTS: Stability of the equilibrium points is given and a simulation is carried out with different values of the parameters. The epidemic dynamics is discussed and illustration is given by figures for different values of the parameters. CONCLUSION: The proposed model allows for better understanding of the disease dynamics. Environment and vaccination strategies are discussed especially in the case of the succession of two epidemics with two different viruses.","['Derouich, M', 'Boutayeb, A', 'Twizell, E H']","['Derouich M', 'Boutayeb A', 'Twizell EH']",,"['Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Sciences, Mohamed I university, Oujda-Morocco.

Dengue infection is a mosquito born disease which has engulfed many regions in general and tropical zone in particular, causing many casualties and has posed a threat to humanity, demanding strategies to resolve the global issue. It is reported that 50-200 million people fall prey to it globally by dint of its causative agents and imperative to mention that over proportional are the minor among the victims. Because of awful joint pain dengue fever is also named break bone fever. The common indicator in infected individuals is thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy and vasculopathy. Apart from supportive therapy, no aphoristic therapy has been introduced so far, however care may prove rescuer. Timely prognosis thwarts to enter it in deteriorating phase. METHODS: In the list of laboratory diagnosis virus serology and detection of Ribonucleic acid are primed. In general, there's no specific decisive diagnostic biomarker present through which accurate and prompt prognosis can possible during the entire patient presentation time, particularly in case of secondary dengue infection. Although, through the advancement and commercialization of point-care combined tests, capable of tracking disease markers present during various phases of infection (viral non-structural protein 1 and immunoglobulin M), such evaluation massively improved the treatment through lab-based. CONCLUSIONS: Despite such improvements, major hurdles persist in the clinical management of patients with dengue infection, particularly lack of dependable biomarkers that have an efficacious prognostic gauge to predict steady progress to severe disease.

Concurrent dengue manifests itself differently than mono-infected patients, and it becomes even more important to understand the effects of co-infecting serotypes in concurrent infections to ascertain the clinical outcomes of the disease progression and transmission. In addition, there have also been reports of concurrent DENV infections in the presence of other arboviral infections. In this review, we provide a comprehensive breakdown of concurrent dengue infections globally.

We assessed each outbreak to identify risk factors and propose a framework for prevention and impact mitigation. Seven out of ten countries in eastern Africa and three islands in the Indian Ocean have experienced dengue outbreaks between 1823 and 2014. Major risk factors associated with past dengue outbreaks include climate, virus and vector genetics and human practices. Appropriate use of dengue diagnostic tools and their interpretation are necessary for both outbreak investigations and sero-epidemiological studies. Serosurvey findings during inter-epidemic periods have not been adequately utilised to prevent re-occurrence of dengue outbreaks. Local weather variables may be used to predict dengue outbreaks, while entomological surveillance can complement other disease-mitigation efforts during outbreaks and identify risk-prone areas during inter-epidemic periods. The limitations of past dengue outbreak responses and the enormous socio-economic impacts of the disease on human health are highlighted. Its repeated occurrence in East Africa refutes previous observations that susceptibility may depend on race. Alternate hypotheses on heterotypic protection among flaviviruses may not be applied to all ecologies. Prevention and mitigation of severe dengue outbreaks should necessarily consider the diverse factors associated with their occurrence. Implementation of phased dengue mitigation activities can enforce timely and judicious use of scarce resources, promote environmental sanitation, and drive behavioural change, hygienic practices and community-based vector control. Understanding dengue epidemiology and clinical symptoms, as determined by its evolution, are significant to preventing future dengue epidemics.","['Baba, Marycelin', 'Villinger, Jandouwe', 'Masiga, Daniel K']","['Baba M', 'Villinger J', 'Masiga DK']",,"['Martin Luscher Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory (ML-EID), International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe), Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science, P.M.B. 1069, University of Maiduguri, Maiduguri, Nigeria.', 'Martin Luscher Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory (ML-EID), International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe), Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Martin Luscher Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory (ML-EID), International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe), Nairobi, Kenya.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20160229,England,Rev Med Virol,Reviews in medical virology,9112448,,IM,"['Africa, Eastern/epidemiology', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*etiology/history/prevention & control', '*Dengue Virus/immunology', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,2016/03/01 06:00,2016/12/31 06:00,['2016/03/01 06:00'],"['2015/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/rmv.1877 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Med Virol. 2016 May;26(3):183-96. doi: 10.1002/rmv.1877.

METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study. 2922 patients aged 18 years or more with dengue fever in National Hospital for Tropical Diseases (NHTD) in the North and Hospital for Tropical Disease (HTD) in the South of Vietnam were recruited in this study. RESULT: Patients were admitted in the hospital around the year and concentrated from August to December, in 53/63 (84.0%) provinces in Vietnam, and patients in all ages were affected. The number of patients with dengue fever was 1675 (57.3%), dengue with warning signs 914 (31.3%), and severe dengue 333 (11.4%), respectively. Among patients with severe dengue, severe plasma leakage and dengue shock account for 238 (8.1%), severe organ impairment 73 (2.5%), and severe bleeding 22 (0.75%). The rate of mortality was 0.8%, and the outcome of dengue patients is worse in the elderly and people with underlying diseases. CONCLUSION: The 2017 dengue outbreak occurred in a larger scale than in the previous years in terms of time, location, and number of patients. More elderly patients were infected by dengue in this outbreak, and this may contribute to the mortality rate. Clinical manifestations of dengue patients in Southern Vietnam are more typical than the northern, but the rate of severe dengue is not different. The mortality risk and underlying conditions associated with dengue-infected elderly patients are worthy of further investigations in the future.","['Huy, Bui Vu', 'Hoa, Le Nguyen Minh', 'Thuy, Dang Thi', 'Van Kinh, Nguyen', 'Ngan, Ta Thi Dieu', 'Duyet, Le Van', 'Hung, Nguyen Thanh', 'Minh, Ngo Ngoc Quang', 'Truong, Nguyen Thanh', 'Chau, Nguyen Van Vinh']","['Huy BV', 'Hoa LNM', 'Thuy DT', 'Van Kinh N', 'Ngan TTD', 'Duyet LV', 'Hung NT', 'Minh NNQ', 'Truong NT', 'Chau NVV']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9273-6503', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0389-6514']","['Hanoi Medical University, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Hanoi Medical University, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Hanoi, Vietnam.', ""Children's Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam."", ""Children's Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam."", 'Hospital for Tropical Disease, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Hospital for Tropical Disease, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191107,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Dengue Virus/pathogenicity', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/epidemiology', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Severe Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Vietnam/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6877935,2019/12/10 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2019/12/10 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/3085827 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2019 Nov 7;2019:3085827. doi: 10.1155/2019/3085827. eCollection 2019.,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Bui Vu Huy et al.'],,,"['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the', 'publication of this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. POPULATION AND METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of dengue infection admitted to hospitals in Santander (Colombia) during the years 1993 to 1998 were studied. On admittance or during hospitalization, patients were classified as cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue fever (DF). Clinical findings differing from those of major hemorrhage were recorded in the emergency room and during the first assessment at hospitalization. The association between these findings and the outcome of DHF were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: 891 patients (DF: 420; DHF: 471) were included in the study. Associations were found between DHF and the following signs and symptoms: vomiting (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.37-2.6; p = 0.0001); gingival hemorrhage (OR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.11-2.18; p = 0.01); epistaxis (OR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.28-2.48; p = 0.001); hepatomegaly (OR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.61-4.07; p < 0.0001); microscopic hematuria (OR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.36-4; p = 0.002); and rash (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.04-1.77; p = 0.02). The hematocrit in the emergency room and on the first day of hospitalization was significantly higher in the group with DHF (p < 0.001, in both observations). On multivariate analysis, the hematocrit from DHF patients obtained in the emergency room was higher than that from DF, independently of the other relevant variables (difference: 3.65; 95% CI: 2.81-4.49).

Dengue is often underreported and misdiagnosed due to a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Diagnosis of dengue is based on clinical case definitions and laboratory methods. Newer case definitions of dengue have been formulated by clinical studies in order to improve case detection. Owing to its epidemic potential, mortality and morbidity, there is a need for a rapid and accurate diagnostic assay for dengue in order to help the clinician in the early detection of cases and to prevent disease progression. A duplex real time PCR targeting the 3'UTR region for rapid and simultaneous detection of all dengue viruses serotypes (1-4) was standardized based on published literature. About 150 patients with acute undifferentiated febrile illness classified based on the 2009 WHO dengue case definition were tested using the duplex real time dengue PCR. Sequencing based PCR was performed on selected PCR positive samples for partial nucleotide sequence of the CprM gene and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. Statistical analysis was done using the MedCalc software. Out of the 126 patients classified as dengue disease positive, according to the 2009 WHO dengue case definition, 54% had ""probable dengue"", 43% had ""dengue with warning signs"" and 3% had ""severe dengue"". The performance of the duplex real time PCR was assessed among the various clinical groups of dengue and it was found that in the ""dengue with warning signs group"" PCR had a positive predictive value of 85.29% (range - 68.94% to 95.05%) when compared with dengue NS1 ELISA. The average time for PCR positivity was found to be four days from the onset of illness. The cycling threshold values obtained from real time PCR were used as a semi quantitative measure of viremia. Accordingly, there was a relatively low CT value among the ""warning signs dengue group"" when compared to the ""probable dengue group"". The use of the duplex PCR is suggested in the early diagnosis of dengue, especially in the 'warning signs' group of patients as they showed a higher positivity rate. Also, the use of the resultant CT value as a semi-quantitative measure of viremia will assist the clinician in early diagnosis and prevention of disease development.","['Seshan, Vigna', 'Sarangan, Gopalsamy', 'Sheriff, Khaleefathullah', 'Krishnasamy, Kaveri', 'Palani, Gunasekaran', 'Srikanth, Padma']","['Seshan V', 'Sarangan G', 'Sheriff K', 'Krishnasamy K', 'Palani G', 'Srikanth P']",,"['Department of Microbiology, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Sri Ramachandra University, Porur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600116, India.', 'Department of Microbiology, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Sri Ramachandra University, Porur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600116, India.', 'King Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research, SIDCO Industrial Area, Guindy, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600032, India.', 'King Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research, SIDCO Industrial Area, Guindy, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600032, India.', 'King Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research, SIDCO Industrial Area, Guindy, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600032, India.', 'Department of Microbiology, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Sri Ramachandra University, Porur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600116, India. srikanth_padma@rediffmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170616,Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/*blood/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",,2017/06/18 06:00,2018/04/03 06:00,['2017/06/17 06:00'],"['2017/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00705-017-3429-7 [pii]', '10.1007/s00705-017-3429-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Virol. 2017 Oct;162(10):2983-2988. doi: 10.1007/s00705-017-3429-7.

The identification of a biomarker that can predict, or rule out, its subsequent development can help identify at-risk individuals. METHODS: 200 dengue patients were included - the first 100 in the deterministic cohort and the latter, the validation cohort. Serum ferritin levels were measured at first presentation. Platelets were monitored serially. Data from the first cohort was used to determine the optimal ferritin level to predict significant thrombocytopenia (<20,000/microL). This threshold was validated in the second cohort. RESULTS: In the deterministic cohort, a ferritin threshold of 593 ng/mL predicted severe thrombocytopenia with a sensitivity of 93.33%, negative predictive value of 98.18% and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.10. In the validation cohort, the sensitivity and negative predictive value of this threshold were both 100%. The power of the study (determined post-hoc) for each cohort was 98.4% and 86.4% respectively. CONCLUSION: First-contact ferritin consistently identified at-risk individuals. Individuals with ferritin levels below 593 ng/mL were unlikely to develop severe thrombocytopenia independent of clinical presentation.","['Lodha, Abhijit', 'Pillai, Ashwin', 'Reddy, Pavan', 'Munshi, Nita']","['Lodha A', 'Pillai A', 'Reddy P', 'Munshi N']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0543-2235'],"['Department of Medicine, Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, India.', 'Department of Medicine, Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, India.', 'Department of Medicine, Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220126,England,Infect Dis (Lond),"Infectious diseases (London, England)",101650235,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cohort Studies', '*Dengue/complications/diagnosis', 'Ferritins', 'Humans', '*Thrombocytopenia']",,2022/01/28 06:00,2022/04/15 06:00,['2022/01/27 05:35'],"['2022/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2022/01/27 05:35 [entrez]']",['10.1080/23744235.2022.2032823 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Dis (Lond). 2022 Jun;54(6):425-430. doi: 10.1080/23744235.2022.2032823.

A cluster-randomized controlled trial in Managua, Nicaragua, and in three coastal regions in Guerrero, Mexico (75 intervention and 75 control clusters), Camino Verde used non-governmental community health workers, called brigadistas, to support community mobilization. This donor-funded trial demonstrated reductions of 29.5% (95% confidence interval, CI: 3.8%-55.3%) on dengue infections and 24.7% (CI: 1.8%-51.2%) on self-reported cases. METHODS: We estimated program costs through a micro-costing approach and semi-structured questionnaires. We show results as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for costs per disability-adjusted life-year (DALYs) averted and conducted probabilistic sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: The Camino Verde trial spent US$16.72 in Mexico and $7.47 in Nicaragua per person annually. We found an average of 910 (CI: 487-1 353) and 500 (CI: 250-760) dengue cases averted annually per million population in Mexico and Nicaragua, respectively, compared to control communities. The ICER in Mexico was US$29 618 (CI: 13 869-66 898) per DALY averted, or 3.0 times per capita GDP. For Nicaragua, the ICER was US$29 196 (CI: 14294-72181) per DALY averted, or 16.9 times per capita GDP. INTERPRETATION: Camino Verde, as implemented in the research context, was marginally cost-effective in Mexico, and not cost-effective in Nicaragua, from a healthcare sector perspective. Nicaragua's low per capita GDP and the use of grant-funded management personnel weakened the cost-effectiveness results. Achieving efficiencies by incorporating Camino Verde activities into existing public health programs would make Camino Verde cost-effective.","['Tschampl, Cynthia A', 'Undurraga, Eduardo A', 'Ledogar, Robert J', 'Coloma, Josefina', 'Legorreta-Soberanis, Jose', 'Paredes-Solis, Sergio', 'Arostegui, Jorge', 'Hernandez-Alvarez, Carlos', 'Harris, Eva', 'Andersson, Neil', 'Shepard, Donald S']","['Tschampl CA', 'Undurraga EA', 'Ledogar RJ', 'Coloma J', 'Legorreta-Soberanis J', 'Paredes-Solis S', 'Arostegui J', 'Hernandez-Alvarez C', 'Harris E', 'Andersson N', 'Shepard DS']",,"['Schneider Institutes for Health Policy, The Heller School for Social Policy and Management, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA.', 'Escuela de Gobierno, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, RM, Chile.', 'CIET International, New York, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Centro de Investigacion de Enfermedades Tropicales (CIET), Universidad Autonoma de Guerrero, Acapulco, Mexico.', 'Centro de Investigacion de Enfermedades Tropicales (CIET), Universidad Autonoma de Guerrero, Acapulco, Mexico.', 'CIET, Nicaragua.', 'CIET, Nicaragua.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Centro de Investigacion de Enfermedades Tropicales (CIET), Universidad Autonoma de Guerrero, Acapulco, Mexico; Department of Family Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', 'Schneider Institutes for Health Policy, The Heller School for Social Policy and Management, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA.

There are four dengue virus serotypes: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. Subsequent infections increase the risk of developing severe dengue fever. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from travellers returning from the endemic area of dengue fever were examined with the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method. Primers amplified 743 bp fragment of the NS5 and 3'UTR genomic region of mosquito-borne flaviviruses of JEV group were used. RESULTS: The sequences from the 10 examined patients were compared to available DENV sequences in GenBank database and the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) results confirmed that the infective virus was DENV-1 (6 patients), DENV-2 (2 patients) and DENV-3 (2 patients). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time in Poland, dengue virus serotypes were determined in travellers returning from dengue-endemic areas.","['Biernat, Beata', 'Stanczak, Joanna', 'Szostakowska, Beata', 'Wroczynska, Agnieszka', 'Kuna, Anna', 'Nahorski, Waclaw L', 'Racewicz, Maria']","['Biernat B', 'Stanczak J', 'Szostakowska B', 'Wroczynska A', 'Kuna A', 'Nahorski WL', 'Racewicz M']",,"['Department of Tropical Parasitology, Institute of Maritime and Tropical Medicine, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland. bebe@gumed.edu.pl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Poland,Int Marit Health,International maritime health,100958373,,IM,"['Dengue/epidemiology/*transmission/virology', '*Dengue Virus/genetics', 'Humans', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Serogroup', '*Travel']",,2015/06/30 06:00,2016/04/09 06:00,['2015/06/30 06:00'],"['2015/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['VM/OJS/J/42435 [pii]', '10.5603/IMH.2015.0018 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Marit Health. 2015;66(2):72-6. doi: 10.5603/IMH.2015.0018.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The illness imposes the greatest economic and human burden on developing countries that have limited resources to deal with the scale of the problem. No cure for dengue exists; treatment is limited to rehydration therapy, and with vector control strategies proving to be relatively ineffective, a vaccine is an urgent priority. Despite the numerous challenges encountered in the development of a dengue vaccine, several vaccine candidates have shown promise in clinical development and it is believed that a vaccination program would be at least as cost-effective as current vector control programs. The lead candidate vaccine is a tetravalent, live attenuated, recombinant vaccine, which is currently in Phase III clinical trials. Vaccine introduction is a complex process that requires consideration and is discussed here.

This study explores the temporal and spatial spread characteristics of dengue fever in the distribution of road network by observing a dengue epidemic in the southern Chinese cities. Geographic information technology is used to extract the spatial location of cases and explore the temporal and spatial changes of dengue epidemic and its spatial relationship with road network. The results showed that there was a significant ""severe"" period in the temporal change of dengue epidemic situation, and the cases were mainly concentrated in the vicinity of narrow roads, the spread of the epidemic mainly along the high-density road network area. These results show that high-density road network is an important factor to the direction and scale of dengue epidemic. This information may be helpful to the development of related epidemic prevention and control strategies.","['Li, Qiaoxuan', 'Cao, Wei', 'Ren, Hongyan', 'Ji, Zhonglin', 'Jiang, Huixian']","['Li Q', 'Cao W', 'Ren H', 'Ji Z', 'Jiang H']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; School of Geographical Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou 350007, China.

The aim of this study was to find the prevalence of seropositivity among blood samples drawn from suspected dengue cases at a tertiary care centre of Nepal. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital from 1st June 2017 to 31st October 2018 after getting approval from the Institutional Review Committee (Reference number: 23/2016). A total of 537 suspected dengue patients were selected for the study using convenience sampling. These dengue positive sera were assayed for their reactivity with Immunoglobulin M and Immunoglobulin G present in sera and synthetic peptides of dengue virus by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Data was entered and analysed in Microsoft Excel 2016. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency, percentage, mean and standard deviation. RESULTS: Among 537 suspected dengue cases, the seropositivity for dengue was found in 124 (23.09%) (19.52-26.65 at 95% Confidence Interval) of the serum. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that dengue was more prevalent in our setting compared to similar studies. All the synthetic peptides showed reactivity with dengue-positive sera with maximum reactivity shown by RR2 peptide. In dengue-positive sera, RR2 peptide of dengue virus identified more Immunoglobulin M than Immunoglobulin G.","['Shreewastav, Rupesh Kumar', 'Thakur, Manoj Kumar', 'Singh, Arambam Giridhari']","['Shreewastav RK', 'Thakur MK', 'Singh AG']",,"['Department of Biochemistry, Nobel Medical College Teaching Hospital, Biratnagar, Morang, Nepal.', 'Department of Medicine, Nobel Medical College Teaching Hospital, Biratnagar, Morang, Nepal.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Nobel Medical College Teaching Hospital, Biratnagar, Morang, Nepal.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220215,Nepal,JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc,JNMA; journal of the Nepal Medical Association,0045233,['0 (Immunoglobulin M)'],IM,"['Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Nepal/epidemiology', 'Tertiary Care Centers']",PMC9200015,2022/02/26 06:00,2022/03/01 06:00,['2022/02/25 05:36'],"['2020/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2022/02/25 05:36 [entrez]', '2022/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31729/jnma.5253 [doi]'],epublish,JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc. 2022 Feb 15;60(246):155-159. doi: 10.31729/jnma.5253.,246,,['NOTNLM'],['dengue; IgG; IgM; tertiary care.'],['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 2.5 billion of the world's population is at risk for dengue infection. Early diagnosis is the key to prevent the deterioration of health of the patient to severe illness. Laboratory diagnosis of dengue is essential for providing appropriate supportive treatment to dengue patients with febrile illness, which is difficult to diagnose clinically. Here, we demonstrate surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based diagnosis of dengue virus in clinical blood samples collected from total of 102 subjects. All of the samples were well characterized by conventional NS1 antigen and IgM antibody ELISA kits. The silver nanorods array fabricated by glancing angle deposition technique were employed as SERS substrates. A small amount of patient blood serum (5 muL) was taken for analysis and the report was prepared within a minute.

Despite the availability of CYD-TDV as a commercial vaccine, its long-term efficacy against all four dengue virus serotypes remains unsatisfactory. There is therefore an urgent need for the development of antiviral drugs for the treatment of dengue. Peptide was once a neglected choice of medical treatment but it has lately regained interest from the pharmaceutical industry following pioneering advancements in technology. In this review, the design of peptide drugs, antiviral activities and mechanisms of peptides and peptidomimetics (modified peptides) action against dengue virus are discussed. The development of peptides as inhibitors for viral entry, replication and translation is also described, with a focus on the three main targets, namely, the host cell receptors, viral structural proteins and viral non-structural proteins. The antiviral peptides designed based on these approaches may lead to the discovery of novel anti-DENV therapeutics that can treat dengue patients.","['Chew, Miaw-Fang', 'Poh, Keat-Seong', 'Poh, Chit-Laa']","['Chew MF', 'Poh KS', 'Poh CL']",,"['Research Centre for Biomedical Sciences, Sunway University, Bandar Sunway, Selangor 47500, Malaysia.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Jalan Universiti, Kuala Lumpur, 50603, Malaysia.', 'Research Centre for Biomedical Sciences, Sunway University, Bandar Sunway, Selangor 47500, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171015,Australia,Int J Med Sci,International journal of medical sciences,101213954,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (CYD-TDV vaccine)', '0 (Dengue Vaccines)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Peptidomimetics)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Dengue/*drug therapy/epidemiology/virology', 'Dengue Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Dengue Virus/*drug effects/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Peptides/*therapeutic use', 'Peptidomimetics/*therapeutic use', 'Virus Internalization/drug effects']",PMC5707751,2017/12/05 06:00,2018/07/22 06:00,['2017/12/05 06:00'],"['2017/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['ijmsv14p1342 [pii]', '10.7150/ijms.21875 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Med Sci. 2017 Oct 15;14(13):1342-1359. doi: 10.7150/ijms.21875. eCollection 2017.,13,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antiviral therapeutics.', 'Dengue virus', 'Drug discovery', 'Peptides']",['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to estimate the volume of hydration in Reunionese patients with dengue. METHODS: A prospective observational study included patients presenting with a 'dengue-like' syndrome in ambulatory care. General practitioners recruited patients during consultation, and beverage consumption over the previous 24 hours was reported at two different times. Warning signs were defined according to the 2009 WHO guidelines. RESULTS: GPs included 174 patients from April to July 2019. Average oral hydration volume was 1863 mL and 1944 mL, at the 1st and 2nd medical consultations, respectively. Water was the most wide consumed liquid. Drinking at least 5 glasses of liquid was significantly associated with fewer clinical warning signs at the 1st medical consultation (p = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient hydration volume could prevent dengue warning signs. Further studies with standardized measurement of hydration would be needed.","['Besnard, O', 'Maillard, O', 'Franco, J-M', 'Lebreton, N', 'Reix, G', 'Legrand, F', 'Bertolotti, A', 'Leruste, S']","['Besnard O', 'Maillard O', 'Franco JM', 'Lebreton N', 'Reix G', 'Legrand F', 'Bertolotti A', 'Leruste S']",,"[""Universite de La Reunion - UFR Sante - Departement universitaire de medecine generale, Site de l'IES, CHU de La Reunion, Saint-Pierre, France."", 'INSERM, CIC1410, CHU de La Reunion, Saint-Pierre, France.

In French Guiana, where all four dengue serotypes, i.e., DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4, are present, the disease is endemic with epidemic outbreaks. Though previous serological studies have suggested a sylvatic cycle, involvement of wild mammals in the dengue cycle in the neotropics has never been confirmed. The purpose of this study was to search for the presence of DENV in wild animals captured at two different sites between 2001 and 2007. About 10,000 trap/nights were performed leading to the capture of 464 non-flying mammals (rodents and marsupials). In addition, mistnests placed in the same zone yielded 152 bats. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification to detect infection by any of the four dengue serotypes demonstrated viral RNA in the livers and/or sera of 92 captured animals. Sequence analysis of amplification products revealed that the DENV-1, DENV-3 and DENV-4 serotypes were distinct from those circulating in humans at the same periods. Analysis for DENV-2 showed that some strains were divergent from concurrent human strains but that others were identical. The latter finding suggests that wild neotropical mammals living in periurban area can be infected by dengue virus strains circulating in humans. However, further investigation will be needed to determine if neotropical mammals are incidental hosts or potential reservoirs of dengue virus.","['Lavergne, A', 'Lacoste, V', 'Germain, A', 'Matheus, S', 'Dussart, P', 'Deparis, X', 'de Thoisy, B']","['Lavergne A', 'Lacoste V', 'Germain A', 'Matheus S', 'Dussart P', 'Deparis X', 'de Thoisy B']",,"['Laboratoire des Interactions Virus-Hotes, Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, Cayenne. alavergne@pasteur-cayenne.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,France,Med Trop (Mars),Medecine tropicale : revue du Corps de sante colonial,8710146,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dengue/classification/genetics/*transmission', '*Disease Vectors', 'Humans', 'Mammals/*virology', 'RNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Tropical Climate']",,2009/09/04 06:00,2009/10/30 06:00,['2009/09/04 09:00'],"['2009/09/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Med Trop (Mars). 2009 Aug;69(4):345-50.,4,,,,,,,,,Infection par le virus de la dengue de mammiferes sauvages en region neotropicale: hotes accidentels ou reservoirs potentiels?,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 200 cases were reported covering all age groups and both sexes. The cases presented with pyrexia, myalgia, arthralgia and headache. Palatal petechiae, magenta colored tongue with central coating, maculopapular rash and facial flush were observed as classical signs. The tourniquet test was positive in 12% of the cases. Hemorrhage was observed in the form of epistaxis (2 cases), subconjunctival hemorrhage (2 cases) or purpura (3 cases). There were no deaths which were attributable to the epidemic. Five strains of dengue (DEN-2) virus were recovered from the acute-phase sera. Dengue virus-specific IgM type of antibodies were detected in 29/116 (25%) sera. Breeding of Aedes aegypti was observed in some of the areas where cases had occurred. No virus was isolated from any of the field-caught Ae. aegypti mosquitos.","['Padbidri, V S', 'Adhikari, P', 'Thakare, J P', 'Ilkal, M A', 'Joshi, G D', 'Pereira, P', 'Guttikar, S N', 'Walhekar, B D', 'Chowta, N', 'Hegde, B M']","['Padbidri VS', 'Adhikari P', 'Thakare JP', 'Ilkal MA', 'Joshi GD', 'Pereira P', 'Guttikar SN', 'Walhekar BD', 'Chowta N', 'Hegde BM']",,"['Department of Medicine, Kastutba Medical College, Mangalore, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,The Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health,0266303,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Convalescence', 'Culicidae', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/immunology/transmission/virology', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Insect Vectors', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', '*Urban Health']",,1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health. 1995 Dec;26(4):699-704.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of MyMAT in reducing dengue cases and relating the cases to rainfall. An experimental field study was conducted for 42 weeks at Pangsapuri Nilam Sari, Shah Alam, Selangor. A total of 624 MyMAT was allocated at four blocks: inside each apartment and outside at the corridors in each level. Mosquito and rainfall data were collected weekly using MyMAT and a mobile rain gauge, respectively. The dengue cases data was retrieved from the e-dengue system obtained from the Malaysia Ministry of Health. The findings showed that MyMAT could catch 97% of Aedes mosquitoes and reduced dengue cases on average of 78%, indicating MyMAT is a reliable Aedes mosquito trap. Interestingly the findings also revealed a significant relationship between dengue cases, the number of Aedes mosquitoes, and rainfall. This week notified dengue cases increased when last two weeks mosquitoes increased due to previous two weeks rainfall increment. Thus indicating an indirect but significant relationship between this week notified dengue cases with the last four weeks rainfall. These relationships can be used in establishing a dengue outbreak forecasting model, which can act as an early warning system.","['Shahar, Mohd Khadri', 'Ismail, Suzilah', 'Ahmad, Rohani', 'Omar, Topek']","['Shahar MK', 'Ismail S', 'Ahmad R', 'Omar T']",,"['Medical Entomology Unit, Institute for Medical Research, National Institute of Health, Ministry of Health, Malaysia.', 'School of Quantitative Sciences, Universiti Utara Malaysia, UUM Sintok, Kedah, Malaysia.', 'Medical Entomology Unit, Institute for Medical Research, National Institute of Health, Ministry of Health, Malaysia.', 'Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Vector Borne Dis,Journal of vector borne diseases,101212761,,IM,"['*Aedes', 'Animals', '*Dengue/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Malaysia/epidemiology', 'Rain']",,2022/09/21 06:00,2022/09/23 06:00,['2022/09/20 03:23'],"['2022/09/20 03:23 [entrez]', '2022/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['JVectorBorneDis_2022_59_2_139_335727 [pii]', '10.4103/0972-9062.335727 [doi]']",ppublish,J Vector Borne Dis. 2022 Apr-Jun;59(2):139-144. doi: 10.4103/0972-9062.335727.,2,,['NOTNLM'],"['Malaysia Mosquito Autocidal Trap', 'MyMAT', 'dengue cases', 'green technology', 'rainfall']",['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other unexpected observations were that only 63% of the patients had classical dengue shock syndrome with haemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia and shock. A high percentage (80%) had gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and in 9 patients (30%) this was severe enough to cause shock and death. In these 9 cases, the gastrointestinal haemorrhage and haematemesis began before the onset of shock and there was no evidence of haemoconcentration or pleural effusion at any time during hospitalization. According to certain widely accepted criteria, these patients would not be diagnosed as dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). But as they made up nearly one-third of the confirmed fatal dengue infections in this study and had massive gastrointestinal haemorrhages with thrombocytopenia, the definition of DHF should be changed to include this type of patient. It is proposed that the disease should be more realistically classified as dengue fever with or without haemorrhage and dengue shock syndrome.","['Sumarmo', 'Wulur, H', 'Jahja, E', 'Gubler, D J', 'Suharyono, W', 'Sorensen, K']","['Sumarmo', 'Wulur H', 'Jahja E', 'Gubler DJ', 'Suharyono W', 'Sorensen K']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,Switzerland,Bull World Health Organ,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,7507052,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/complications/microbiology/*mortality', 'Encephalitis/complications', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Serotyping', 'Sex Factors']",PMC2536140,1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull World Health Organ. 1983;61(4):693-701.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some studies have concluded that these indices can be used as indicators of dengue epidemic risk, while other studies have failed to find a predictive relationship. Ecological niche models have been able to predict distributional patterns in space and time, not only of vectors, but also of the diseases that they transmit. In this study, we used Landsat 7 ETM+ images and two niche-modeling algorithms to estimate the local-landscape ecological niche and the dynamics of Ae. aegypti larval habitats in Bello, Colombia, and to evaluate their potential spatial and temporal distribution. Our models showed low omission error with high confidence levels: about 13.4% of the area presents conditions consistently suitable for breeding across the entire study period (2002-2008). The proportion of neighborhoods predicted to be suitable showed a positive association with dengue case rates, whereas the vector-focused Bretau index had no relationship to case rates. As a consequence, niche models appear to offer a superior option for predictive evaluation of dengue transmission risk and anticipating the potential for outbreaks.","['Arboleda, Sair', 'Jaramillo-O, Nicolas', 'Peterson, A Townsend']","['Arboleda S', 'Jaramillo-O N', 'Peterson AT']",,"['Grupo de Biologia y Control de Enfermedades Infecciosas (BCEI), Instituto de Biologia, Universidad de Antioquia, Sede de Investigaciones Universitarias, Medellin, Colombia. sairorieta@yahoo.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Vector Ecol,Journal of vector ecology : journal of the Society for Vector Ecology,9512496,,IM,"['*Aedes', 'Animals', 'Colombia', 'Dengue/epidemiology/*transmission', 'Insect Vectors', '*Larva']",,2012/05/03 06:00,2012/08/30 06:00,['2012/05/03 06:00'],"['2012/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1948-7134.2012.00198.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Vector Ecol. 2012 Jun;37(1):37-48. doi: 10.1111/j.1948-7134.2012.00198.x.,1,['(c) 2012 The Society for Vector Ecology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Outbreaks of autochthonous dengue in the United States occurred extensively in the past but over the past 3 decades have again taken place in Florida, Hawaii, and Texas as well as in American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. As the Aedes vectors spread worldwide it is anticipated that DENV as well as other viruses also transmitted by these vectors, such as Chikungunya virus (CHKV), will invade new areas of the world, including the United States. OBJECTIVES: In this review, we describe the current burden of dengue disease worldwide and the potential introduction of DENV and CHKV into different areas of the United States. Of these areas, the state of California saw the arrival and spread of the Aedes aegypti vector beginning in 2013. This invasion presents a developing situation when considering the state's number of imported dengue cases and proximity to northern Mexico as well as the rising specter of chikungunya in the Western hemisphere. FINDINGS: In light of the recent arrival of Aedes aegypti mosquito vectors to California, there is now a small but appreciable risk for endemic transmission of dengue and chikungunya within the State. It is likely, however, that if DENV or CHKV were to become endemic that the public health situation would be similar to that currently found along the Texas-Mexico border. The distribution of Aedes vectors in California as well as a discussion of several factors contributing to the risk for dengue importation are discussed and evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue and chikungunya viruses present real risks to states where the Aedes vector is now established. Scientists, physicians, and public health authorities should familiarize themselves with these risks and prepare appropriately.","['Fredericks, Anthony C', 'Fernandez-Sesma, Ana']","['Fredericks AC', 'Fernandez-Sesma A']",,"['Department of Microbiology and The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.', 'Department of Microbiology and The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.

The recognition of progression signs of this severe disease during the initial febrile phase can be difficult, since the symptoms are often indistinguishable from other febrile diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical manifestations and laboratory findings in patients from two dengue outbreaks and their association with the disease. The study was conducted in patients (n = 153) with signs and symptoms consistent with dengue occurred during two distinct epidemics, 2010 and 2013, in the city of Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. According to the 2009 World Health Organization criteria, patients were classified as dengue without warning signs ([DwoWS] 60.6%, 57/94), dengue with warning signs ([DwWS] 30.9%, 29/94), and SD (4.25%, 4/94). Patients with DwWS/SD presented lower platelet and leukocyte counts and higher transaminase levels when compared with the DwoWS ones. Interestingly, patients from the epidemic of 2010 caused by dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) had lower platelet counts than patients of the 2013 epidemic caused by DENV-4. Furthermore, plasma leakage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pleural effusion, hallmarks for a more severe disease, were also more frequently observed in those cases. Although previous studies may have extensively reported the wide range of the clinical aspects of dengue, the characterization of DENV-4 is desirable considering the burden of the disease during epidemics, especially for the health units and hospitals performing patient's management.","['da Costa Faria, Nieli Rodrigues', 'Solorzano, Victor Edgar Fiestas', 'de Souza, Luiz Jose', 'Nogueira, Rita Maria Ribeiro', 'de Bruycker-Nogueira, Fernanda', 'Chouin-Carneiro, Thais', 'Santos Simoes, Jaqueline Bastos', 'da Rocha Queiroz Lima, Monique', 'de Oliveira Pinto, Luzia Maria', 'Kubelka, Claire Fernandes', 'Heringer, Manoela', 'de Azeredo, Elzinandes Leal', 'Barreto Dos Santos, Flavia']","['da Costa Faria NR', 'Solorzano VEF', 'de Souza LJ', 'Nogueira RMR', 'de Bruycker-Nogueira F', 'Chouin-Carneiro T', 'Santos Simoes JB', 'da Rocha Queiroz Lima M', 'de Oliveira Pinto LM', 'Kubelka CF', 'Heringer M', 'de Azeredo EL', 'Barreto Dos Santos F']",,"['Viral Immunology Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Hospital dos Plantadores de Cana, Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Flavivirus Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Viral Immunology Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Viral Immunology Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Viral Immunology Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Viral Immunology Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Viral Immunology Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Hospital dos Plantadores de Cana, Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Hospital dos Plantadores de Cana, Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Viral Immunology Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Hospital dos Plantadores de Cana, Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Viral Immunology Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Trop Med Hyg,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,0370507,,IM,"['Brazil/epidemiology', 'Dengue/epidemiology/*pathology/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*classification/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Epidemics', 'Humans', 'Serogroup']",PMC5508884,2017/07/19 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2017/07/19 06:00'],"['2017/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['tpmd160227 [pii]', '10.4269/ajtmh.16-0227 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2017 Jul;97(1):137-145. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.16-0227.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in February 2015 using secondary data acquired from the hospital records. There were 2607 confirmed dengue cases presented to Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM) in 2014. Seven hundred patients were selected after proportionate stratified random sampling conducted according to the number of cases in 12 different months in 2014. Data were collected and analysed using SPSS version 22.0. Results: Severe dengue outcomes represented 4.9% of cases. The prevalence of any of WS in SD was 91.2%. The most common WSs prior to SD were persistent vomiting (55.9%), and abdominal pain/tenderness (52.9%). The most sensitive warning sign in detecting SD was abdominal pain (59%). Specificity of individual WS were generally good, especially of clinical fluid accumulation (99%), hepatomegaly (98%) and mucosal bleeding (93%). Factors associated with SD were persistent vomiting (Adjusted odds ratio (aOR)): 2.41), mucosal bleeding (aOR: 4.73) and haematocrit rise with rapid platelet drop (aOR: 2.74). Conclusion: A focus on sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and association of a number of particular WS should be emphasized in order to better predict severe dengue outcomes.","['Ahmad, Mohd Hanief', 'Ibrahim, Mohd Ismail', 'Mohamed, Zeehaida', 'Ismail, Nabilah', 'Abdullah, Muhammad Amiruddin', 'Shueb, Rafidah Hanim', 'Shafei, Mohd Nazri']","['Ahmad MH', 'Ibrahim MI', 'Mohamed Z', 'Ismail N', 'Abdullah MA', 'Shueb RH', 'Shafei MN']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5470-4180', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7023-9717']","['Department of Community Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kota Bharu 16150, Kelantan, Malaysia. haniefahmad@gmail.com.', 'Department of Community Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kota Bharu 16150, Kelantan, Malaysia. ismaildr@usm.my.', 'Department of Microbiology & Parasitology, School of Medical Sciences, Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kota Bharu 16150, Kelantan, Malaysia. zeehaida@usm.my.', 'Department of Microbiology & Parasitology, School of Medical Sciences, Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kota Bharu 16150, Kelantan, Malaysia. drnabilah@usm.my.', 'Department of Microbiology & Parasitology, School of Medical Sciences, Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kota Bharu 16150, Kelantan, Malaysia. amiruddin@usm.my.', 'Department of Microbiology & Parasitology, School of Medical Sciences, Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kota Bharu 16150, Kelantan, Malaysia. hanimkk@usm.my.', 'Department of Community Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kota Bharu 16150, Kelantan, Malaysia. drnazri@usm.my.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180915,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Malaysia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prevalence', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severe Dengue/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6163319,2018/09/19 06:00,2019/02/02 06:00,['2018/09/19 06:00'],"['2018/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph15092018 [pii]', 'ijerph-15-02018 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph15092018 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2018 Sep 15;15(9):2018. doi: 10.3390/ijerph15092018.,9,,['NOTNLM'],"['Malaysia', 'accuracy', 'prediction', 'severe dengue', 'warning signs']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],"['Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2019 Mar 14;16(6):.

Sera were studied by hemagglutination-inhibition, complement-fixation and plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) tests for antibodies to the known viral causes of the dengue syndrome in Asia and to St. Louis encephalitis virus. PRNT tests were done with and without fresh normal human serum (accessory factor). Serum from one of four Siler study volunteers had unequivocal evidence of only a previous d4 infection; the remainder had broadly reactive group B antibodies, including d4, suggesting past infection with two or more different dengue viruses. Sera from four of the Simmons study group had high-titered PRNT antibodies to d1 and the remaining serum had d1 antibody when accessory factor was added. In three sera there was monotypic PRNT antibody to d1. Acessory factor increased PRNT titers, particularly to d1 virus in the Simmons group. Only sera with antibody patterns suggesting past infections with two or more dengue viruses had high levels of SLE PRNT antibody. It is concluded that d4 was transmitted in the 1924 to 1925 and d1 in the 1929 to 1930 experiments. Notable differences in clinical features of dengue infections in the two studies suggest the possibility of the existence of an unique spectrum of responses to infection with different dengue virus type.","['Halstead, S B']",['Halstead SB'],,,['eng'],"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Trop Med Hyg,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,0370507,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Antigens, Viral', 'Complement Fixation Tests', 'Dengue/*etiology/history/immunology/transmission', 'Dengue Virus/immunology', 'Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Philippines', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States']",,1974/09/01 00:00,1974/09/01 00:01,['1974/09/01 00:00'],"['1974/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1974/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1974/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.4269/ajtmh.1974.23.974 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1974 Sep;23(5):974-82. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.1974.23.974.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Siler JF', 'Simmons JS']","['Siler, J F', 'Simmons, J S']",

METHODS: This is a retrospective study from January 2019 through December 2019. Various renal manifestations of dengue were studied and compared between the severity of dengue fever. RESULTS: Three hundred nineteen children with dengue fever were hospitalized and 127 needed intensive care admission. Among the 127 patients, 26 (20.5%) children developed acute kidney injury (AKI). Children with severe dengue developed a higher number of AKI (n = 20; 28.6%), as compared to dengue with warning sign group (n = 6; 11.8%). Colloid infusion, inotropic support, ventilatory requirement and presence of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis were the risk factors for AKI. Nine children underwent dialysis. Among the AKI group, 23 recovered and 3 died and all three had multi organ dysfunction syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: It is essential to recognize the various renal manifestations of dengue AKI which is associated with increased mortality and morbidity.","['Rajan, Mahalakshmi', 'Geminiganesan, Sangeetha', 'Sankaranarayanan, Shuba', 'Padmanaban, Ramachandran', 'Selvam, Mahalakshmi Panneer']","['Rajan M', 'Geminiganesan S', 'Sankaranarayanan S', 'Padmanaban R', 'Selvam MP']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0734-1126'],"['Department of Pediatric Medicine, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Porur, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Medicine, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Porur, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India. sangeethaperungo@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pediatric Medicine, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Porur, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Medicine, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Porur, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Medicine, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Porur, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200615,India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,,IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', '*Dengue/complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units, Pediatric', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,2020/06/20 06:00,2021/03/25 06:00,['2020/06/20 06:00'],"['2020/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12098-020-03402-z [pii]', '10.1007/s12098-020-03402-z [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2020 Dec;87(12):1014-1017. doi: 10.1007/s12098-020-03402-z.

One chemical is temephos, an organophosphate used to control mosquitoes. The other is chlorine-based products, which are used to disinfect surfaces and water. While global health projects tend to treat these substances as stable objects, there are three ways in which they might be understood as leaky things, implicated in fluid social interactions. First, global health chemicals are tracked through rigid accounting, but because of numerical leakages, they become vehicles for fashioning new forms of concern. Second, chemicals leak structurally: They can be dissolved and reproduced at a molecular level, although that dissolution is never absolute, and that reproduction is not everywhere the same. Third, chemicals leak in a sensory fashion. Sensory interactions with chemicals produce an entanglement of knowledge about bodies and environments.","['Nading, Alex M']",['Nading AM'],,"['a Social Anthropology, School of Social and Political Science, University of Edinburgh , Edinburgh , Scotland , UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20160521,United States,Med Anthropol,Medical anthropology,7707343,"['0 (Disinfectants)', '0 (Insecticides)', '4R7X1O2820 (Chlorine)', 'ONP3ME32DL (Temefos)']",IM,"['Anthropology, Medical', 'Chlorine', '*Dengue/ethnology/prevention & control/transmission', 'Disinfectants', '*Environmental Exposure', '*Global Health', 'Humans', '*Insecticides', 'Nicaragua/ethnology', '*Temefos']",,2016/05/24 06:00,2017/08/25 06:00,['2016/05/24 06:00'],"['2016/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01459740.2016.1186672 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Anthropol. 2017 Feb-Mar;36(2):141-156. doi: 10.1080/01459740.2016.1186672.

In this study, we consider dengue control strategies that are relevant to the current situation in Malaysia. They are the use of adulticides, larvicides, destruction of the breeding sites, and individual protection. The global stability of the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium is constructed using the Lyapunov function theory. The relations between the order of the operator and control parameters are briefly analysed. Numerical simulations are performed to verify theoretical results and examine the significance of each intervention strategy in controlling the spread of dengue in the community. The model shows that vector control tools are the most efficient method to combat the spread of the dengue virus, and when combined with individual protection, make it more effective. In fact, the massive use of personal protection alone can significantly reduce the number of dengue cases. Inversely, mechanical control alone cannot suppress the excessive number of infections in the population, although it can reduce the Aedes mosquito population. The result of the real-data fitting revealed that the FODE model slightly outperformed the integer-order model. Thus, we suggest that the FODE approach is worth to be considered in modelling an infectious disease like dengue.","[""Hamdan, Nur 'Izzati"", 'Kilicman, Adem']","[""Hamdan N'"", 'Kilicman A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8333-6153'],"['School of Mathematical Sciences, College of Computing, Informatics and Media, Universiti Teknologi MARA, 40450, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia. izzatihamdan@uitm.edu.my.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Faculty of Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), 43400, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20221026,United States,Bull Math Biol,Bulletin of mathematical biology,0401404,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', '*Dengue/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Models, Biological', 'Mathematical Concepts', '*Aedes', 'Models, Theoretical']",,2022/10/27 06:00,2022/10/29 06:00,['2022/10/26 11:14'],"['2022/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2022/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/10/26 11:14 [entrez]', '2022/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11538-022-01096-2 [pii]', '10.1007/s11538-022-01096-2 [doi]']",epublish,Bull Math Biol. 2022 Oct 26;84(12):138. doi: 10.1007/s11538-022-01096-2.,12,"['(c) 2022.

Among returning travelers, dengue is now a frequent cause of hospitalization. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with severe disease hospitalized in a European, non-endemic country applying the revised 2009 WHO classification system and to determine predictors of severe disease. METHODS: A retrospective single-center analysis of clinical data from 56 patients, 31 (55 %) women and 25 (45 %) men, between 14 and 70 years of age treated in a tertiary care hospital between 1996 and 2010 was conducted. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (69.6 %) presented with dengue fever without warning signs, 11 (19.6 %) with warning signs and 6 (10.7 %) with signs for severe dengue fever. Two patients (4 %) developed dengue shock syndrome. Non-European descent (p = 0.001), plasma protein level <6.5 mg/dl (p = 0.001), platelets <30/nl (p = 0.017) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) >44 s (p = 0.003) were associated with severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of patients hospitalized with symptomatic imported dengue fever in Germany have evidence of severe disease. Simple routine laboratory parameters such as complete blood count, plasma protein level and aPTT are helpful tools for identifying adult patients at risk for severe disease.","['Hoffmeister, B', 'Suttorp, N', 'Zoller, T']","['Hoffmeister B', 'Suttorp N', 'Zoller T']",,"['Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite University Medicine Berlin, Chariteplatz 1, 10117, Berlin, Germany, b.hoffmeister-infekt@charite.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141125,Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers', '*Travel Medicine', 'Young Adult']",,2014/11/26 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2014/11/26 06:00'],"['2014/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s15010-014-0688-z [doi]'],ppublish,Infection. 2015 Feb;43(1):21-8. doi: 10.1007/s15010-014-0688-z.

METHODS: Demographic, clinical and investigation findings of adult dengue patients admitted to the two hospitals from June to August 2017 were collected and analysed. RESULTS: A total of 1167 patients (777 males [66.2%], mean age 32.9 y) were studied. There were 775 (66.4%) patients with dengue fever (DF), 334 (28.6%) with dengue haemorrhagic fever grade I, 54 (4.6%) with DHF grade II and 4 (0.3%) with DHF grade III. DHF was significantly associated with abdominal symptoms/signs and bleeding manifestations (p<0.001). A considerable variation in time of onset of the critical phase was noted (day 3, 11.9%; day 4-5, 63.1%; day 6, 16.2%; day >/=7, 8.7%). Significantly lower platelet and white blood cell counts and elevated transaminase levels were found in DHF than DF (p<0.001). Other complications included myocarditis (two patients) and mild renal impairment (three patients). None had neurological manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: We found abdominal symptoms/signs, low platelet and white blood cell counts and high transaminase to be associated with DHF. The onset of the critical phase was variable and difficult to predict. Compiling data from various regions would help to understand disease patterns, which in turn would help in formulating evidence-based management guidelines and the allocation of limited health care resources.","['Jayarajah, Umesh', 'de Silva, Pradeep K', 'Jayawardana, Priyankara', 'Dissanayake, Upul', 'Kulatunga, Aruna', 'Fernando, Harshini', 'Perera, Lakshika', 'Kannangara, Vibhavee', 'Udayangani, Champika', 'Peiris, Ranga', 'Faizer, Shuaib', 'Yasawardene, Pamodh', 'de Zoysa, Ishan', 'Seneviratne, Suranjith L']","['Jayarajah U', 'de Silva PK', 'Jayawardana P', 'Dissanayake U', 'Kulatunga A', 'Fernando H', 'Perera L', 'Kannangara V', 'Udayangani C', 'Peiris R', 'Faizer S', 'Yasawardene P', 'de Zoysa I', 'Seneviratne SL']",,"['Dengue Unit, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Dengue Research Group, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Dengue Unit, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Dengue Unit, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Medicine, Base Hospital, Panadura, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Medicine, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Medicine, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Dengue Research Group, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, 25 Kynsey Road, Colombo 00800, Sri Lanka.', 'Dengue Research Group, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, 25 Kynsey Road, Colombo 00800, Sri Lanka.', 'Dengue Research Group, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, 25 Kynsey Road, Colombo 00800, Sri Lanka.', 'Dengue Research Group, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, 25 Kynsey Road, Colombo 00800, Sri Lanka.', 'Dengue Research Group, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Dengue Research Group, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Dengue Research Group, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, 25 Kynsey Road, Colombo 00800, Sri Lanka.', 'Dengue Research Group, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, 25 Kynsey Road, Colombo 00800, Sri Lanka.', 'Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Royal Free Hospital and University College London, Pond Street, Hampstead, London, NW3 2QG, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,England,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,7506129,,IM,"['Adult', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*physiopathology/therapy/virology', 'Dengue Virus/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Evidence-Based Practice', 'Female', 'Hospitals/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Serologic Tests', 'Sri Lanka/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2018/05/05 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/05/05 06:00'],"['2017/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['4991831 [pii]', '10.1093/trstmh/try034 [doi]']",ppublish,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2018 Mar 1;112(3):144-153. doi: 10.1093/trstmh/try034.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current dengue control efforts have generally focused on vector control but have not shown major impact. School-aged children are especially vulnerable to infection, due to sustained human-vector-human transmission in the close proximity environments of schools. Infection in children has a higher rate of complications, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndromes, than infections in adults. There is an urgent need for integrated and complementary population-based strategies to protect vulnerable children. We hypothesize that insecticide-treated school uniforms will reduce the incidence of dengue in school-aged children. The hypothesis would need to be tested in a community based randomized trial. If proven to be true, insecticide-treated school uniforms would be a cost-effective and scalable community based strategy to reduce the burden of dengue in children.","['Wilder-Smith, A', 'Lover, A', 'Kittayapong, P', 'Burnham, G']","['Wilder-Smith A', 'Lover A', 'Kittayapong P', 'Burnham G']",,"['National University of Singapore, Department of Medicine, Singapore. epvws@pacific.net.sg']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110312,United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,,IM,"['Child', '*Clothing', 'Dengue/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', '*Schools', 'Thailand/epidemiology']",,2011/03/15 06:00,2011/09/16 06:00,['2011/03/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0306-9877(11)00088-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2011.02.037 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2011 Jun;76(6):861-2. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2011.02.037.

In 2008 and 2009, only imported cases were reported in RS, but from 2010 to 2013, reports of autochthonous infections increased significantly. This study analyzes and discusses laboratory, demographic, and clinical data regarding dengue cases in RS, from 2014 to 2016. This study analyzed 13,420 serum samples from notified patients with suspicion of dengue fever in RS from 2014 to 2016. Seasonality of positive cases, viral serotypes, and clinical and epidemiological aspects were analyzed. There was no difference in gender (P = .4); dengue fever occurred mainly in adults, with similar distribution among age groups. The number of dengue virus (DENV) cases increased from 89 cases in 2014 to 2518 in 2016. Dengue virus 1 was the most prevalent circulating serotype during this period (97.5% of cases). Dengue virus infections show peaks in March and April (late summer and early autumn), after periods of high temperatures and rainfall. In 2014, dengue cases were concentrated in the northwestern and eastern regions of RS, and in 2015 and 2016, the northern region also confirmed a high number of cases. With increase in DENV circulation in RS, a rise in the number of autochthonous infections was also observed, mainly in highly urbanized areas. This study revealed that circulation of DENV in RS increased significantly in 2015 and 2016, with a rise in the number of autochthonous infections and cocirculation with Chikungunya and Zika viruses, recently introduced into RS.","['Gregianini, Tatiana Schaffer', 'Tumioto-Giannini, Gabriela Luchiari', 'Favreto, Catia', 'Plentz, Luciana Ciarelli', 'Ikuta, Nilo', 'da Veiga, Ana B Gorini']","['Gregianini TS', 'Tumioto-Giannini GL', 'Favreto C', 'Plentz LC', 'Ikuta N', 'da Veiga ABG']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1462-5506'],"['Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica da Secretaria de Saude do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (LACEN/SES-RS), Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica da Secretaria de Saude do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (LACEN/SES-RS), Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Centro Estadual de Vigilancia em Saude da Secretaria de Saude do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (CEVS/SES-RS), Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Universidade Luterana do Brasil (ULBRA), Canoas, Brazil.', 'Universidade Luterana do Brasil (ULBRA), Canoas, Brazil.', 'PPG-Patologia, PPG-Biociencias, Universidade Federal de Ciencias da Saude de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20171206,England,Rev Med Virol,Reviews in medical virology,9112448,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/history/*virology', '*Dengue Virus/classification/genetics', 'Female', 'Geography', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Population Surveillance', 'Serogroup', 'Young Adult']",,2017/12/07 06:00,2018/10/26 06:00,['2017/12/07 06:00'],"['2017/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/rmv.1960 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Med Virol. 2018 Jan;28(1). doi: 10.1002/rmv.1960.

Studies on a large number of patients with dengue infection to assess associated cardiac involvement are rare. METHODS: We analyzed the incidence and spectrum of cardiac abnormalities in 320 patients with dengue fever admitted to our hospital located in an endemic area for dengue infection. All patients were evaluated following the WHO guidelines. Those confirmed to have dengue infection by serology had detailed clinical evaluation, 12‑lead electrocardiography (ECG), assay for cardiac markers (troponin T, CK-MB, NT Pro BNP) and 2-D echocardiography. RESULTS: Among the 320 patients selected for the study 112 (35%) had changes of cardiac involvement as detected by investigations. Changes in ECG were seen in all of them. Sinus bradycardia in spite of fever was the most common abnormality (n = 63;19.7%). Forty-two (13.1%) patients had left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%. Forty-eight patients (15%) had increased serum levels of troponin-T. Serum levels of CK-MB were elevated in 34 (10.6%) and serum levels of NT-pro BNP was increased in 19 (5.9%). Fourteen patients died and all of them had abnormalities in electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and serum markers. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that cardiac involvement in patients with dengue infection is not uncommon. We found that ECHO or ECG abnormalities or elevated serum levels of markers of cardiac injury are predictors of risk for adverse outcome. Absence of these abnormalities has a 100% negative predictive value.","['Shah, Chintan', 'Vijayaraghavan, Govindan', 'Kartha, Chandrasekharan C']","['Shah C', 'Vijayaraghavan G', 'Kartha CC']",,"['Department of Cardiology, Society for Continuing Medical Education & Research, Kerala Institute of Medical Sciences, Trivandrum 695029, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Cardiology, Society for Continuing Medical Education & Research, Kerala Institute of Medical Sciences, Trivandrum 695029, Kerala, India.

The pathogenesis of severe dengue results from a complex interaction between the virus, the host, and, at least in part, immune-mediated mechanisms. Vaccine development has been slowed by fears that immunisation might predispose individuals to the severe form of dengue infection. A pipeline of candidate vaccines now exists, including live attenuated, inactivated, chimeric, DNA, and viral-vector vaccines, some of which are at the stage of clinical testing.

As a consequence, the search for new anti-dengue agents from medicinal plants has assumed more urgency than in the past. Medicinal plants have been used widely to treat a variety of vector ailments such as malaria. The demand for plant-based medicines is growing as they are generally considered to be safer, non-toxic and less harmful than synthetic drugs. This article reviews potential anti-dengue activities from plants distributed around the world. Sixty-nine studies from 1997 to 2012 describe 31 different species from 24 families that are known for their anti-dengue activities. About ten phytochemicals have been isolated from 11 species, among which are compounds with the potential for development of dengue treatment. Crude extracts and essential oils obtained from 31 species showed a broad activity against Flavivirus. Current studies show that natural products represent a rich potential source of new anti-dengue compounds. Further ethnobotanical surveys and laboratory investigations are needed established the potential of identified species in contributing to dengue control.","['Abd Kadir, Siti Latifah', 'Yaakob, Harisun', 'Mohamed Zulkifli, Razauden']","['Abd Kadir SL', 'Yaakob H', 'Mohamed Zulkifli R']",,"['Department of Bioprocess Engineering, Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 81310, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia, slatifah2@live.utm.my.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130417,Japan,J Nat Med,Journal of natural medicines,101518405,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Dengue/*drug therapy/epidemiology/virology', 'Humans', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Plants, Medicinal/chemistry']",PMC3765846,2013/04/18 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2012/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['767 [pii]', '10.1007/s11418-013-0767-y [doi]']",ppublish,J Nat Med. 2013 Oct;67(4):677-89. doi: 10.1007/s11418-013-0767-y.

In-vitro findings suggest that coagulopathy and disturbances in fibrinolysis have a pivotal role in the pathophysiology. If disturbances in these processes are predictive of clinical outcome in this disease, there could be important consequences for both diagnosis and treatment. We have critically reviewed publications on this topic to assess whether there is an association between activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis and clinical outcome of dengue-virus infections. In general, the selected studies showed activation of both the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems in this infection. The activation was more pronounced in severe infections and in cases with a poor clinical outcome. However, the findings were not consistent, and owing to a lack of detailed information on characteristics of patients, disease, and study design, we could not ascertain whether inconsistencies were caused by differences in these characteristics, selection bias, or confounding factors. We conclude that an association between activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis and clinical outcome of dengue-virus infections is conceivable but has been inadequately assessed and that methodologically sound studies, complemented with complete and reliable reporting, are needed to show whether there is a true association.","['Mairuhu, A T A', 'Mac Gillavry, M R', 'Setiati, T E', 'Soemantri, A', 'ten Cate, H', 'Brandjes, D P M', 'van Gorp, E C M']","['Mairuhu AT', 'Mac Gillavry MR', 'Setiati TE', 'Soemantri A', 'ten Cate H', 'Brandjes DP', 'van Gorp EC']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Slotervaart Hospital, Amsterdam, Netherlands. atamairuhu@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Lancet Infect Dis,The Lancet.

Dengue control in Malaysia is currently based on reactive vector management within 24 h of a dengue case being reported. Preventive rather than reactive vector control approaches, with combined interventions, are expected to improve the cost-effectiveness of dengue control programs. The principal objective of this cluster randomized controlled trial is to quantify the effectiveness of a preventive integrated vector management (IVM) strategy on the incidence of dengue as compared to routine vector control efforts. METHODS: The trial is conducted in randomly allocated clusters of low- and medium-cost housing located in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya. The IVM approach combines: targeted outdoor residual spraying with K-Othrine Polyzone, deployment of mosquito traps as auto-dissemination devices, and community engagement activities. The trial includes 300 clusters randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio. The clusters receive either the preventive IVM in addition to the routine vector control activities or the routine vector control activities only. Epidemiological data from monthly confirmed dengue cases during the study period will be obtained from the Vector Borne Disease Sector, Malaysian Ministry of Health e-Dengue surveillance system. Entomological surveillance data will be collected in 12 clusters randomly selected from each arm. To measure the effectiveness of the IVM approach on dengue incidence, a negative binomial regression model will be used to compare the incidence between control and intervention clusters. To quantify the effect of the interventions on the main entomological outcome, ovitrap index, a modified ordinary least squares regression model using a robust standard error estimator will be used. DISCUSSION: Considering the ongoing expansion of dengue burden in Malaysia, setting up proactive control strategies is critical. Despite some limitations of the trial such as the use of passive surveillance to identify cases, the results will be informative for a better understanding of effectiveness of proactive IVM approach in the control of dengue.

The number of dengue cases was increased in recent years in Nepal. Chitwan is one of the risky areas of dengue. This aim of the study is to find out the prevalence of hospital admission among the dengue positive cases. METHODS: The descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among 323 serologically confirmed dengue fever positive patient admitted in Medicine Inpatients Department of Chitwan Medical College Teaching Hospital. Ethical approval was taken from the Institutional Review Committee (Reference number. 076/077-121 dated August 30, 2019). Data were collected from 1st September 2019 to 31st December 2019 using a structured interview schedule and record review. Convenience sampling was done. Data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 11. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated, with frequency and percentage. RESULTS: Among 1206 patient with dengue fever, 323 (26.78%) (24.29-29.27 at 95% confidence Interval) were admitted in the tertiary care hospital. Study findings revealed that out of 323 admitted patients with dengue fever, 182 (56.3%) patients were between 20-40 years of age and 179 (55.4%) were males. The highest number of patients were admitted in the months of September 192 (59.4%) and October 101 (31.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Admission rate among dengue positive cases are comparable to other studies of the similar settings. Dengue fever is common among community people especially in young adult and males. Hence, screening of dengue fever in febrile illness is necessary for the early diagnosis and prompt treatment.","['Poudyal, Sunita', 'Subba, Hem Kumari', 'Sharma, Kalpana']","['Poudyal S', 'Subba HK', 'Sharma K']",,"['School of Nursing, Chitwan Medical College, Bharatpur, Chitwan, Nepal.', 'School of Nursing, Chitwan Medical College, Bharatpur, Chitwan, Nepal.', 'School of Nursing, Chitwan Medical College, Bharatpur, Chitwan, Nepal.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211211,Nepal,JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc,JNMA; journal of the Nepal Medical Association,0045233,,IM,"['Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",PMC9200038,2022/02/25 06:00,2022/02/26 06:00,['2022/02/24 08:42'],"['2020/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/02/24 08:42 [entrez]', '2022/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31729/jnma.5307 [doi]'],epublish,JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc. 2021 Dec 11;59(244):1272-1276. doi: 10.31729/jnma.5307.,244,,['NOTNLM'],['dengue; fever; profile.'],['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated 84 suspected DHF patients, including 45 (53.6%) males and 39 (46.4%) females. The ages of the patients ranged from five-83 years and the median age was 29. According to the DHF/dengue shock syndrome classification, 53 (63.1%) patients were classified as having dengue fever and 31 (36.9%) as having DHF.

METHODS: This study was a prospective observational study of children diagnosed with dengue from July 2012 through February 2013 at a tertiary care hospital in Bangalore, Karnataka (South India). RESULTS: Eighty one children including 55(67.9 %) boys and 26(32.1 %) girls were diagnosed with dengue. Mean age of presentation was 8 y. Vomiting (60.5 %), pain abdomen (32 %), headache (30.9 %), myalgia (23.5 %) and bleeding manifestations (16 %) were the common presenting complaints. Facial puffiness (63 %), hepatomegaly (51.9 %), ascites (48.1 %), pleural effusion (39.5 %) and petechiae (14.8 %) were noted during examination. Dengue NS1 antigen, IgM, IgG were positive in 66.7 %, 29.6 % and 18.5 % of cases respectively. Investigations showed hemoconcentration in 72.8 %, leucopenia (34.5 %), thrombocytopenia (82.7 %), abnormal liver function test (LFT) (33.3 %).

Following an initial febrile period, a small proportion of infected patients develop a vasculopathy, with children at particular risk for severe vascular leakage and shock. Differentiation between dengue and other common childhood illnesses is difficult during the early febrile phase, and risk prediction for development of shock is poor. The presence of microalbuminuria is recognized as a useful early predictor for subsequent complications in a number of other disorders with vascular involvement. Significant proteinuria occurs in association with dengue shock syndrome and it is possible that early-phase microalbuminuria may be helpful both for diagnosis of dengue and for identification of patients likely to develop severe disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We measured formal urine albumin to creatinine ratios (UACRs) in daily samples obtained from a large cohort of children with suspected dengue recruited at two outpatient clinics in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Although UACRs were increased in the 465 confirmed dengue patients, with a significant time trend showing peak values around the critical period for dengue-associated plasma leakage, urine albumin excretion was also increased in the comparison group of 391 patients with other febrile illnesses (OFI). The dengue patients generally had higher UACRs than the OFI patients, but microalbuminuria, using the conventional cutoff of 30 mg albumin/g creatinine discriminated poorly between the two diagnostic groups in the early febrile phase. Secondly UACRs did not prove useful in predicting either development of warning signs for severe dengue or need for hospitalization. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Low-level albuminuria is common, even in relatively mild dengue infections, but is also present in many OFIs. Simple point-of-care UACR tests are unlikely to be useful for early diagnosis or risk prediction in dengue endemic areas.","['Hanh Tien, Nguyen Thi', 'Lam, Phung Khanh', 'Duyen, Huynh Thi Le', 'Ngoc, Tran Van', 'Ha, Phan Thi Thanh', 'Kieu, Nguyen Tan Thanh', 'Simmons, Cameron', 'Wolbers, Marcel', 'Wills, Bridget']","['Hanh Tien NT', 'Lam PK', 'Duyen HT', 'Ngoc TV', 'Ha PT', 'Kieu NT', 'Simmons C', 'Wolbers M', 'Wills B']",,"['Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Hospital for Tropical Diseases, District 5, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130122,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Albumins)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Albumins/*analysis', 'Albuminuria/*diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Creatinine/urine', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology/*urine', 'Dengue Virus/pathogenicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Vietnam/epidemiology']",PMC3551767,2013/01/26 06:00,2013/07/20 06:00,['2013/01/26 06:00'],"['2012/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-12-29274 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0054538 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(1):e54538. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0054538.

METHODS: It was a prospective cross-sectional study for five years from 2011-2016 in a tertiary care medical college hospital in Bangalore. All cases of fever of three to five days duration with symptoms like dengue were enrolled for the study. They were categorized into three groups as per the Revised WHO 2012 criteria. Laboratory parameters, serology, ultrasound abdomen and X-ray were done in almost all patients. Data was analysed by SPSS software, version 16, and different groups were compared with Chi square test. RESULTS: Five hundred sixty eight children were diagnosed to have dengue fever; 4.2% of the sample belonged to infancy. Majority were in the age group of 5-10 y (42.6%). Fever and flushing were present in majority of the children. Gastrointestinal bleed was more commonly seen in the severe dengue group. Dengue nonstructural protein antigen (NS1Ag) was positive in 78%, immunoglobulin M (IgM) in 15.8% and immunoglobulin G (IgG) in 14.6%. Children with IgG had more complications, though not statistically significant. Mortality was reported in 1.2%. Dengue serology helped to confirm the diagnosis, however did not help in patient management. CONCLUSIONS: There is a considerable overlap in the symptomatology of dengue with warning signs and severe dengue. More studies are required on the severity and type of response to treatment in infants and obese adoloscents with severe dengue.","['Ramabhatta, Sujatha', 'Palaniappan, Saravanan', 'Hanumantharayappa, Navya', 'Begum, Shaik Vajidunnisa']","['Ramabhatta S', 'Palaniappan S', 'Hanumantharayappa N', 'Begum SV']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7322-9920'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Shifaa Hospital, Bengaluru, Karnataka, 560052, India. sujatharamabhatta@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sapthagiri Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sapthagiri Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sapthagiri Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20170908,India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dengue/*classification/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Severe Dengue/classification/epidemiology', 'World Health Organization']",,2017/09/10 06:00,2018/08/07 06:00,['2017/09/10 06:00'],"['2016/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/09/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12098-017-2423-0 [pii]', '10.1007/s12098-017-2423-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2017 Dec;84(12):897-901. doi: 10.1007/s12098-017-2423-0.

Although dengue viruses are endemic throughout El Salvador, very little is known about their ecology and epidemiology. The principal methods to prevent and reduce dengue cases are through vector control and by adoption of a vaccine. In addition, understanding the environmental and socioeconomic factors associated with dengue could contribute to case reduction by targeting prevention efforts in dengue hotspots. This study investigated environmental and socioeconomic factors associated with dengue cases in El Salvador. Dengue cases were obtained from 2011 to 2013 for 262 municipalities. The mean incidence was determined for each municipality for the 3 year period. Negative binomial regression models evaluated the relationship between dengue cases and the environmental factors elevation, forest coverage, mean annual temperature, and cumulative precipitation. Twelve socioeconomic and infrastructure variables and their relationship with dengue were also investigated by using negative binomial regression. A total of 29,764 confirmed dengue cases were reported. The mean dengue incidence for 2011-2013 was 135/100,000. The highest number of dengue cases occurred in San Salvador and surrounding municipalities, as well as in two additional cities, Santa Ana and San Miguel; the highest incidence of dengue cases (per 100,000) occurred in cities in the west and at the center of the country. Significant environmental variables associated with dengue included temperature, precipitation, and non-forested area. The socioeconomic variables poverty rate, illiteracy rate, and school attendance, and the infrastructure variables percent of homes with sanitary service, municipal trash service, electricity, and cement brick flooring, as well as population density, were also significant predictors of dengue. Understanding these environmental and socioeconomic factors and their relationship with dengue will help design and implement timely prevention strategies and vector control to reduce dengue in El Salvador.","['Joyce, Andrea L', 'Alvarez, Francisco Samuel', 'Hernandez, Eunis']","['Joyce AL', 'Alvarez FS', 'Hernandez E']",,"['Department of Public Health, School of Social Sciences Humanities and Arts, University of California Merced, Merced, California, USA.', 'Fundacion Naturaleza El Salvador, Colonia Escalon, San Salvador, El Salvador.', 'Department of Public Health, School of Social Sciences Humanities and Arts, University of California Merced, Merced, California, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210614,United States,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)",100965525,,IM,"['*Aedes', 'Animals', '*Dengue/epidemiology/veterinary', 'El Salvador/epidemiology', 'Forests', 'Mosquito Vectors', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,2021/06/16 06:00,2022/01/27 06:00,['2021/06/15 17:13'],"['2021/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/06/15 17:13 [entrez]']",['10.1089/vbz.2020.2685 [doi]'],ppublish,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2021 Aug;21(8):602-613. doi: 10.1089/vbz.2020.2685.

The Health Belief Model was used as a framework to explore and understand dengue prevention behaviours. METHODS: A total of 14 focus group discussions were conducted with 84 Malaysian citizens of different socio-demographic backgrounds between 16(th) December, 2011 and 12(th) May, 2012. RESULTS: The study revealed that awareness about DF and prevention measures were high. The pathophysiology of dengue especially dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) were rarely known; as a result, it was seen as deadly by some but was also perceived as easily curable by others without a basis of understanding. Young adults and elderly participants had a low perception of susceptibility to DF. In general, the low perceived susceptibility emerged as two themes, namely a perceived natural ability to withstand infection and a low risk of being in contact with the dengue virus vector, Aedes spp. mosquitoes. The barriers to sustained self-prevention against dengue prevention that emerged in focus groups were: i) lack of self-efficacy, ii) lack of perceived benefit, iii) low perceived susceptibility, and iv) unsure perceived susceptibility. Low perceived benefit of continued dengue prevention practices was a result of lack of concerted action against dengue in their neighborhood. Traditional medical practices and home remedies were widely perceived and experienced as efficacious in treating DF. CONCLUSION: Behavioural change towards attaining sustainability in dengue preventive practices may be enhanced by fostering comprehensive knowledge of dengue and a change in health beliefs. Wide use of unconventional therapy for DF warrants the need to enlighten the public to limit their reliance on unproven alternative treatments.","['Wong, Li Ping', 'AbuBakar, Sazaly']","['Wong LP', 'AbuBakar S']",,"['Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. wonglp@ummc.edu.my']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130711,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious/*prevention & control', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Education', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Malaysia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Young Adult']",PMC3708882,2013/07/23 06:00,2014/02/08 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2012/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['PNTD-D-13-00011 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0002310 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2013 Jul 11;7(7):e2310. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002310.

DENV is maintained in nature in two transmission cycles: urban and sylvatic. The latter has only been recorded in Africa and Asia and involves nonhuman primates as natural hosts, although it has been suggested that other mammals may play a secondary role as potential reservoir host, including bats. The objective of this article is to review the current state of knowledge about DENV-positive bats in the Americas and to determine what ecological and human impact variables could favor DENV infection in bats. We performed a search of published studies on natural and experimental DENV infection in bats. From 1952 to 2019, 14 studies have been carried out (71.4% in the last decade) examining DENV infection in bats in seven countries of the Americas. DENV infection was examined in 1884 bats of 63 species and DENV was detected in 19 of these species. Clench's model estimated that more than 75 species could be carriers of DENV; therefore, considering that at least 350 species of bats are distributed in the Americas, to detect 95% of the DENV-bearing species, it would be necessary to examine about 10,206 bats of  approximately 287 species that have not been analyzed until 2019. The species with the highest number of positive cases were Molossus sinaloae and Artibeus jamaicensis. Species, colony size, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, human population size, and bat collection site (site inhabited by humans, vegetation cover, and caves) contributed to explain the variation in DENV detection in bats in the Americas. These results provide evidence on the exposure of bats to DENV in different geographic areas of the Americas and a bat sylvatic transmission cycle is very likely to be occurring, where bats may be either accidental hosts, dead-end hosts, or potential reservoir hosts for DENV.","['Hernandez-Aguilar, Itandehui', 'Lorenzo, Consuelo', 'Santos-Moreno, Antonio', 'Navarrete Gutierrez, Dario', 'Naranjo, Eduardo J']","['Hernandez-Aguilar I', 'Lorenzo C', 'Santos-Moreno A', 'Navarrete Gutierrez D', 'Naranjo EJ']",,"['Departamento de Conservacion de la Biodiversidad.

In this assay, the primers and the probe for amplifying DENV were designed in the conserved regions of the genome after aligned more than 300 nucleotide sequences of four dengue serotypes deposited in the GeneBank. To discriminate the antiviral activity from the cytotoxicity of compounds, a housekeeping gene of the Vero cells, beta-actin, was used to design the primers and the probe for the second set of PCR as an internal control, which is used to normalize the RNA levels of dengue-specific PCR due to the cellular toxicity of test compounds. For compound profiling, the duplex PCR is performed using LightCycler((R)) in a single tube to simultaneously amplify both the dengue target gene and the Vero cell housekeeping gene from the compound-treated Vero cell lysates. This assay was validated against a panel of reference compounds. The results show that the universal primers and probe in this duplex RT-PCR assay can efficiently amplify all four dengue serotypes and that the PCR efficiency for both the dengue target gene and the Vero cells beta-actin gene is 100%.","['Gong, Edwin Yunhao', 'Smets, Alexandra', 'Verheyen, Nick', 'Clynhens, Marleen', 'Gustin, Emmanuel', 'Lory, Pedro', 'Kraus, Guenter']","['Gong EY', 'Smets A', 'Verheyen N', 'Clynhens M', 'Gustin E', 'Lory P', 'Kraus G']",,"['Janssen Infectious Diseases-Diagnostics BVBA, Johnson & Johnson Corporation, Beerse, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,['0 (Antiviral Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Dengue/classification/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests/*methods', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Serotyping', 'Vero Cells']",,2013/07/04 06:00,2014/01/25 06:00,['2013/07/04 06:00'],"['2013/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-62703-484-5_16 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2013;1030:195-203. doi: 10.1007/978-1-62703-484-5_16.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently (1994), an important outbreak has been studied in Ceara State, where DEN-2 and DEN-1 viruses have been isolated. In Rio de Janeiro and Ceara (1990 and 1994, respectively), it is probably the succession of infections by DEN-1 and DEN-2 viruses which has caused many DHF/DSS cases. The urban vector has always been the mosquito Aedes aegypti, from which 4, 7 and 16 strains of DEN-4, DEN-1 and DEN-2 have been isolated, respectively. In Brazil, transovarial transmission of dengue viruses by this species has not yet been shown to occur in nature.","['Degallier, N', 'da Rosa, A P', 'Vasconcelos, P F', 'Figueiredo, L T', 'da Rosa, J F', 'Rodrigues, S G', 'da Rosa, E S']","['Degallier N', 'da Rosa AP', 'Vasconcelos PF', 'Figueiredo LT', 'da Rosa JF', 'Rodrigues SG', 'da Rosa ES']",,"[""Laboratoire d'epidemiologie des maladies a vecteurs, ORSTOM Centre de Montpellier BP 5045, France.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,France,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique (1990),9212564,,IM,"['Aedes', 'Animals', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/*transmission/virology', 'Dengue Virus/classification/isolation & purification', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Humans', '*Insect Vectors']",,1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 1996;89(2):128-35; discussion 136.,2,,,,,,,95,,La dengue et ses vecteurs au Bresil.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bacterial sepsis in dengue fever is not widely recognised. This is a retrospective cohort study of children who had sepsis coexisting along with Dengue fever. One hundred and twenty-four patients aged between three months and eighteen years admitted in two private hospitals in North India were studied. Thirteen children had concurrent sepsis (13/124, 10.4%). Children between 0 and five years (7/13, 53.8%, p = 0.019), having longer hospital stay (7/13, 53.8%, p = 0.00029), shock (10/13, 76.9%, p = 0.00001), and increased PCT (13/13, 100%, p < 0.001) were some indicators of sepsis in these patients. Blood cultures were positive in five children. It is a matter of speculation as to why these patients of dengue are more susceptible to sepsis. Increased vascular permeability may increase the chances of bacterial contamination. Antibiotics should not be used routinely in dengue fever. However, young children presenting with severe symptoms especially shock should be screened for sepsis, and appropriate antibiotics should be started early.","['Sunil, Taneja', 'Alexandra, Bansal', 'Tanu, Midha', 'Ali, Mansuri M', 'Neha, Agarwal', 'Navin, Burman']","['Sunil T', 'Alexandra B', 'Tanu M', 'Ali MM', 'Neha A', 'Navin B']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4412-8148', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2975-7088']","['Consultant and HOD, Department of Pediatrics, Madhuraj Hospital, Kanpur, India.', 'Resident, Department of Pediatrics, Madhuraj Hospital, Kanpur, India.', 'Professor of Community Medicine, GMC, Kannauj, India.', 'Resident, Department of Pediatrics, Madhuraj Hospital, Kanpur, India.', 'Lecturer, Department of Pediatrics, 30076GSVM Medical College, Kanpur.', 'Resident, Department of Pediatrics, Madhuraj Hospital, Kanpur, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210225,England,Trop Doct,Tropical doctor,1301706,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis/diagnosis/*epidemiology']",,2021/02/27 06:00,2023/02/25 06:00,['2021/02/26 05:37'],"['2021/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/02/26 05:37 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0049475521993608 [doi]'],ppublish,Trop Doct. 2021 Jul;51(3):371-375. doi: 10.1177/0049475521993608.

We evaluated the impact of a protocol adopted by the Coroner's Office Rocha Furtado (CO-RF) for the detection of unreported deaths from dengue in Brazil. We evaluated prospectively cases of deaths referred to the CO-RF with suspicion of dengue and those referred with other diagnosis in which the pathologists suspected dengue as the cause of death. Biological material was collected from all bodies autopsied, for which the suspected cause of death was dengue, between January 2011 and December 2012. Of the 214 bodies autopsied, 134 (62.6%) tested positive for dengue; of these cases, 121 were classified as dengue according to the World Health Organization's case definition (1997 or 2009, as appropriate). Thus, CO-RF detected 90 deaths from dengue, which were not suspected during disease progression. This CO-RF protocol, through a combined effort of the surveillance and laboratory teams, increased the detection of fatal dengue cases by 5-fold. This is the largest series of autopsies performed in cases of death related to dengue in the world to date.","['Cavalcanti, Luciano Pamplona de Goes', 'Braga, Deborah Nunes de Melo', 'da Silva, Livia Maria Alexandre', 'Aguiar, Marina Gondim', 'Castiglioni, Mariana', 'Silva-Junior, Jose Udevanier', 'Araujo, Fernanda Montenegro de Carvalho', 'Pereira, Renata Allana da Costa', 'Malta, Danielle Lima', 'Pompeu, Margarida Maria de Lima']","['Cavalcanti LP', 'Braga DN', 'da Silva LM', 'Aguiar MG', 'Castiglioni M', 'Silva-Junior JU', 'Araujo FM', 'Pereira RA', 'Malta DL', 'Pompeu MM']",,"['Department of Community Health, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil;

An increasing cause of acute fever in travellers, it threatens to emerge in temperate regions where competent mosquitoes (Aedes) are established. Dengue fever is characterized by its clinical polymorphism ranging from asymptomatic to severe forms, which are rare in travellers. Its definite diagnosis is based on virological tests selected according to the stage of the disease and the kinetics of the virus. Its treatment is only symptomatic. It is a notifiable disease in mainland France and is subject to a plan to combat its spread and to specific surveillance in the overseas departments.

METHODS: A simple mathematical model, the Richards model, was used to fit the weekly reported dengue case data by municipality, in order to quantify the transmissibility and temporal changes in the epidemic in each municipality via the basic reproduction number R0 . RESULTS: Model fits indicate either a 2-wave or 3-wave outbreak in all municipalities. Estimates for R0 varied greatly, from 1.97 (95% CI: 1.94, 2.01), for Arroyo Naranjo, to 61.06 (60.44, 61.68), for Boyeros, most likely due to heterogeneity in community structure, geographical locations and social networking. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the potential impact of climatological events on disease spread, further highlighting the need to be well prepared for potentially worsening disease spread in the aftermath of natural disasters such as hurricanes/typhoons.","['Hsieh, Ying-Hen', 'de Arazoza, Hector', 'Lounes, Rachid']","['Hsieh YH', 'de Arazoza H', 'Lounes R']",,"['Department of Public Health and Center for Infectious Disease Education and Research, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. hsieh@mail.cmu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130417,England,Trop Med Int Health,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,9610576,,IM,"['Cuba/epidemiology', '*Cyclonic Storms', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/transmission/virology', '*Dengue Virus', '*Epidemics', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Reproduction', 'Residence Characteristics']",,2013/04/18 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2013/04/18 06:00'],"['2013/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tmi.12105 [doi]'],ppublish,Trop Med Int Health. 2013 Jul;18(7):830-8. doi: 10.1111/tmi.12105.

One of these factors is the provision of health services, which is regulated by both demand and supply. Although an adequate provision can significantly improve health outcomes of a population, lopsided flow of patients to specific health centers can result in serious disparities and potentially delay the timeliness of a diagnosis. In this paper, utilization patterns during an epidemic of dengue fever in the city of Cali, Colombia for the year 2010 are investigated. Specifically, the objectives are to (1) identify health facilities that exhibit patterns of over- and underutilization, (2) determine where patients who are being diagnosed at a particular facility originate from, and (3) whether patients are traveling to their closest facility and hence (4) estimate how far patients are willing to travel to be diagnosed and treated for dengue fever. Analysis is further decomposed by age group and by gender, in an attempt to test whether utilization patterns drastically change according to these variables. Answers to these questions can help health authorities plan for future epidemics, for instance, by providing guidelines as to which facilities require more resources and by improving the organization of health prevention campaigns to direct population seeking health assistance to use facilities that are underutilized.","['Casas, Irene', 'Delmelle, Eric']","['Casas I', 'Delmelle E']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5117-2238'],"['Louisiana Tech University, Ruston, LA, 71272, USA.', 'University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, 28223, USA.

We evaluated whether the atypical lymphocyte count (ALC), generated from the Sysmex automated full blood count analyzer, is predictive of severe thrombocytopenia secondary to Dengue infection. METHODS: We prospectively collected data on patients admitted with DD between December 2017 and October 2018. ALC data were extracted from the Sysmex XS500i analyzer from day 1 to day 7 of admission. Clinical data were obtained from patients' medical records. RESULTS: We enrolled 256 patients with DD. A negative correlation between ALC on admission and platelet count on day 5 to day 7 (Spearmen's correlation; day 5:-0.485, day 6:-0.428 and day 7:-0.344) (p=0.001) was observed. Based on receiver operator characteristic curve analysis, we found that an ALC of >0.5x103/L had 90% sensitivity and 70% specificity for severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50x109/L) on day 5. The positive and negative predictive values were 74.4 and 91.2%, respectively (power 84.7). CONCLUSIONS: We propose that ALC on admission may be a novel negative predictive factor for severe thrombocytopenia on day 5 to day 7 of DD. Further studies are required to validate our findings and evaluate whether ALC is predictive of other complications of DD.","['Abeysuriya, Visula', 'Choong, Clarice Shi Hui', 'Thilakawardana, Basuru Uvindu', 'de Mel, Primesh', 'Shalindi, Malka', 'de Mel, Chandima', 'Chandrasena, Lal', 'Seneviratne, Suranjith L', 'Yip, Christina', 'Yap, Eng-Soo', 'de Mel, Sanjay']","['Abeysuriya V', 'Choong CSH', 'Thilakawardana BU', 'de Mel P', 'Shalindi M', 'de Mel C', 'Chandrasena L', 'Seneviratne SL', 'Yip C', 'Yap ES', 'de Mel S']",,"['Nawaloka Hospital Research and Education Foundation, Nawaloka Hospitals PLC, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Haematology- Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System Singapore.', 'Nawaloka Hospital Research and Education Foundation, Nawaloka Hospitals PLC, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Nawaloka Hospital Research and Education Foundation, Nawaloka Hospitals PLC, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Nawaloka Hospital Research and Education Foundation, Nawaloka Hospitals PLC, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Nawaloka Hospital Research and Education Foundation, Nawaloka Hospitals PLC, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Nawaloka Hospital Research and Education Foundation, Nawaloka Hospitals PLC, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Nawaloka Hospital Research and Education Foundation, Nawaloka Hospitals PLC, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Royal Free Hospital and University College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National University Health System Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology- Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System Singapore.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National University Health System Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology- Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System Singapore.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,7506129,,IM,"['*Dengue/complications/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes', 'Platelet Count', '*Severe Dengue', '*Thrombocytopenia/diagnosis/etiology']",,2020/01/12 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/01/12 06:00'],"['2019/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['5699687 [pii]', '10.1093/trstmh/trz128 [doi]']",ppublish,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2020 Jun 1;114(6):424-432. doi: 10.1093/trstmh/trz128.,6,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Since the first occurrence of dengue was confirmed in Guangdong, China in 1978, dengue outbreaks have been reported sequentially in different provinces in South China transmitted by peridomestic Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, diplaying Ae. aegypti, a fully domestic vector that transmits dengue worldwide. Rapid and uncontrolled urbanization is a characteristic change in developing countries, which impacts greatly on vector habitat, human lifestyle and transmission dynamics on dengue epidemics. In September 2010, an outbreak of dengue was detected in Dongguan, a city in Guangdong province characterized by its fast urbanization. An investigation was initiated to identify the cause, to describe the epidemical characteristics of the outbreak, and to implement control measures to stop the outbreak. This is the first report of dengue outbreak in Dongguan, even though dengue cases were documented before in this city. METHODS: Epidemiological data were obtained from local Center of Disease Control and prevention (CDC). Laboratory tests such as real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), the virus cDNA sequencing, and Enzyme-Linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were employed to identify the virus infection and molecular phylogenetic analysis was performed with MEGA5. The febrile cases were reported every day by the fever surveillance system. Vector control measures including insecticidal fogging and elimination of habitats of Ae. albopictus were used to control the dengue outbreak. RESULTS: The epidemiological studies results showed that this dengue outbreak was initiated by an imported case from Southeast Asia. The outbreak was characterized by 31 cases reported with an attack rate of 50.63 out of a population of 100,000. Ae. albopictus was the only vector species responsible for the outbreak. The virus cDNA sequencing analysis showed that the virus responsible for the outbreak was Dengue Virus serotype-1 (DENV-1). CONCLUSIONS: Several characterized points of urbanization contributed to this outbreak of dengue in Dongguan: the residents are highly concentrated; the residents' life habits helped to form the habitats of Ae. albopictus and contributed to the high Breteau Index; the self-constructed houses lacks of mosquito prevention facilities. This report has reaffirmed the importance of a surveillance system for infectious diseases control and aroused the awareness of an imported case causing the epidemic of an infectious disease in urbanized region.","['Peng, Hong-Juan', 'Lai, Hui-Bing', 'Zhang, Qiao-Li', 'Xu, Ba-Yi', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Liu, Wen-Hua', 'Zhao, Wei', 'Zhou, Yuan-Ping', 'Zhong, Xin-Guang', 'Jiang, Shu', 'Duan, Jin-Hua', 'Yan, Gui-Yun', 'He, Jian-Feng', 'Chen, Xiao-Guang']","['Peng HJ', 'Lai HB', 'Zhang QL', 'Xu BY', 'Zhang H', 'Liu WH', 'Zhao W', 'Zhou YP', 'Zhong XG', 'Jiang S', 'Duan JH', 'Yan GY', 'He JF', 'Chen XG']",,"['Key Laboratory of Prevention and Control for Emerging Infectious Diseases of Guangdong Higher Institutes, School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, Peoples Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120126,England,BMC Public Health,BMC public health,100968562,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'China/epidemiology', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/physiopathology/*transmission', '*Disease Outbreaks/prevention & control', 'Disease Vectors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mosquito Control', 'Population Surveillance/methods', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Urbanization', 'Young Adult']",PMC3311058,2012/01/27 06:00,2012/06/21 06:00,['2012/01/27 06:00'],"['2011/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2458-12-83 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2458-12-83 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Public Health. 2012 Jan 26;12:83. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-12-83.,,,,,,,['R01AI093202-01A1/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is no consensus in the literature on factors associated with severity of illness. The objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with the occurrence of severe dengue (SD) according to the criteria adopted in 2009 by the World Health Organization (WHO), during the 2019 epidemic. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 163 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed dengue were included in a multicenter prospective cohort study in Reunion Island between January and June 2019. Of these, 37 (23%) were classified as SD, which involves presentation dominated by at least one organ failure, and 126 (77%) classified as non-SD (of which 90 (71%) had warning signs). Confusion, dehydration, and relative hypovolemia were significantly associated with SD in bivariate analysis (p < 0.05). The factors associated with SD in multivariate analysis were a time from first symptom to hospital consultation over 2 days (OR: 2.46, CI: 1.42-4.27), a history of cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.75, 95%CI: 1.57-4.80) and being of Western European origin (OR: 17.60, CI: 4.15-74). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study confirms that SD is a frequent cause of hospitalization during dengue epidemics in Reunion Island. It suggests that cardiovascular disease, Western European origin, and delay in diagnosis and management are risk factors associated with SD fever, and that restoration of blood volume and correction of dehydration must be performed early to be effective.

The human burden approaches 400 million infections annually. Complex transmission dynamics pose challenges for predicting location, timing, and magnitude of risk; thus, models are needed to guide prevention strategies and policy development locally and globally. Weather regulates transmission-potential via its effects on vector dynamics. An important gap in understanding risk and roadblock in model development is an empirical perspective clarifying how weather impacts transmission in diverse ecological settings. We sought to determine if location, timing, and potential-intensity of transmission are systematically defined by weather. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a high-resolution empirical profile of the local weather-disease connection across Peru, a country with considerable ecological diversity. Applying 2-dimensional weather-space that pairs temperature versus humidity, we mapped local transmission-potential in weather-space by week during 1994-2012. A binary classification-tree was developed to test whether weather data could classify 1828 Peruvian districts as positive/negative for transmission and into ranks of transmission-potential with respect to observed disease. We show that transmission-potential is regulated by temperature-humidity coupling, enabling epidemics in a limited area of weather-space. Duration within a specific temperature range defines transmission-potential that is amplified exponentially in higher humidity. Dengue-positive districts were identified by mean temperature >22 degrees C for 7+ weeks and minimum temperature >14 degrees C for 33+ weeks annually with 95% sensitivity and specificity. In elevated-risk locations, seasonal peak-incidence occurred when mean temperature was 26-29 degrees C, coincident with humidity at its local maximum; highest incidence when humidity >80%. We profile transmission-potential in weather-space for temperature-humidity ranging 0-38 degrees C and 5-100% at 1 degrees C x 2% resolution. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Local duration in limited areas of temperature-humidity weather-space identifies potential locations, timing, and magnitude of transmission. The weather-space profile of transmission-potential provides needed data that define a systematic and highly-sensitive weather-disease connection, demonstrating separate but coupled roles of temperature and humidity. New insights regarding natural regulation of human-mosquito transmission across diverse ecological settings advance our understanding of risk locally and globally for dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases and support advances in public health policy/operations, providing an evidence-base for modeling, predicting risk, and surveillance-prevention planning.","['Campbell, Karen M', 'Haldeman, Kristin', 'Lehnig, Chris', 'Munayco, Cesar V', 'Halsey, Eric S', 'Laguna-Torres, V Alberto', 'Yagui, Martin', 'Morrison, Amy C', 'Lin, Chii-Dean', 'Scott, Thomas W']","['Campbell KM', 'Haldeman K', 'Lehnig C', 'Munayco CV', 'Halsey ES', 'Laguna-Torres VA', 'Yagui M', 'Morrison AC', 'Lin CD', 'Scott TW']",,"['Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University, San Diego, California, United States of America.', 'Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University, San Diego, California, United States of America.', 'Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University, San Diego, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine and Biometrics, Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'US Naval Medical Research Unit No.6, Lima, Peru.', 'Direccion General de Epidemiologia, Lima, Peru.', 'Direccion General de Epidemiologia, Lima, Peru.', 'Department of Entomology, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, San Diego State University, San Diego, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Entomology, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, United States of America; Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20150729,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Animals', 'Dengue/epidemiology/*transmission/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*physiology', 'Epidemics/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Peru/epidemiology', 'Time Factors', '*Weather']",PMC4519153,2015/07/30 06:00,2016/04/16 06:00,['2015/07/30 06:00'],"['1969/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['PNTD-D-15-00207 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0003957 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015 Jul 29;9(7):e0003957. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003957. eCollection 2015.,7,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,['PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015 Sep;9(9):e0004047.

It has 4 serotypes of epidemiological imporatnce. The classification denotes two clinical spectrums- dengue fever (DF) and dengue haemorragic fever (DHF). Most cases are stereotype and amenable to fluid resuscitation. However, unusual manifestations cause fatalities and often overlooked. This study describes 10 such dengue cases to fill the knowledge gaps. CASE PRESENTATION: All 10 patients presented to the Teaching Hospital, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka during mid-year epidemic of dengue in 2016. The mean age is 27 years (range 12-51 years) comprising 6 females and 4 males. The group had 7 DHF, 3 DF and 2 primary dengue infections who predominantly had severe bleeding into gut. Other potentially life threatening problems were acute severe hepatitis, severe septic shock, myocarditis, erratic rapid plasma leak, intracranial bleeding, diarrhoea and decompenstaed dengue shock due to 3rd space fluid leak. Blood transfusions and other empirical therapeutic methods were used apart from meticulous fluid management to suit issues of each patient. Bedside ultrasound scanning helped early detection of critical phase. All recovered fully. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue is an extremely challenging infection to treat in the globe today. Above unusual presentation and complications could be fatal, if not detected early where therapeutic window period is very short. Clinicians need awareness of these problems which are not uncommon, but underreported and often overlooked. The clinical management of each patient was described for the purpose sharing the experiences.","['Kularatne, S A M', 'Ralapanawa, Udaya', 'Dalugama, Chamara', 'Jayasinghe, Jayanika', 'Rupasinghe, Sawandika', 'Kumarihamy, Prabashini']","['Kularatne SAM', 'Ralapanawa U', 'Dalugama C', 'Jayasinghe J', 'Rupasinghe S', 'Kumarihamy P']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7416-7984'],"['Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. udayapralapanawa@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.', 'Teaching Hospital Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20181218,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Dengue/*complications/*diagnosis', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemics', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Severe Dengue/complications/diagnosis', 'Sri Lanka/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6299528,2018/12/20 06:00,2019/02/05 06:00,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-018-3596-5 [pii]', '3596 [pii]', '10.1186/s12879-018-3596-5 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2018 Dec 18;18(1):674. doi: 10.1186/s12879-018-3596-5.,1,,['NOTNLM'],"['DHF', 'Dengue', 'Dengue shock syndrome', 'Expanded dengue syndrome', 'Fulminant liver failure', 'Myocarditis', 'Septic shock', 'Sri Lanka']","['ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Not applicable.

Dengue is caused by infection with any of the four closely related serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-4) and usually manifests as a mild febrile illness, but may develop into fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. There are no specific antiviral therapies against dengue because understanding of DENV biology is limited. A tetravalent chimeric dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, has finally been licensed for use, but its efficacy was significantly lower against DENV-2 infections and in dengue-naive individuals. The identification of mechanisms underlying the interactions between DENV and immune responses will help to determine efficient therapeutic and preventive options. It has been well established how the innate immune system responds to DENV infection and how DENV overcomes innate antiviral defenses, however further progress in this field remains hampered by the absence of appropriate experimental dengue models. Herein, we review the available in vitro and in vivo approaches to study the innate immune responses to DENV.","['Kitab, Bouchra', 'Kohara, Michinori', 'Tsukiyama-Kohara, Kyoko']","['Kitab B', 'Kohara M', 'Tsukiyama-Kohara K']",,"['Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Kagoshima University, 1-21-24 Korimoto, Kagoshima, 890-0065, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, 156-8506, Japan.', 'Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Kagoshima University, 1-21-24 Korimoto, Kagoshima, 890-0065, Japan. kkohara@vet.kagshima-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180308,Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Dengue Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Dengue/drug therapy/*immunology/prevention & control/virology', 'Dengue Vaccines/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Dengue Virus/drug effects/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Mice', 'Primates', 'Severe Dengue/drug therapy/*immunology/prevention & control/virology']",,2018/03/10 06:00,2018/07/10 06:00,['2018/03/10 06:00'],"['2017/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/03/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00705-018-3784-z [pii]', '10.1007/s00705-018-3784-z [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Virol. 2018 Jul;163(7):1717-1726. doi: 10.1007/s00705-018-3784-z.

Although often found in tropical and semitropical areas, dengue is capable of being transmitted in temperate climates as well. Dengue is currently endemic to Mexico, most other Latin American countries, and parts of the Caribbean, and it has the potential to become reestablished as an endemic disease in the United States. In fact, sustained transmission of dengue has occurred in Florida within the past year. Conditions exist in the U.S. that could facilitate sustained dengue transmission, including environmental factors, competent mosquito vectors, limited vector and dengue surveillance, increased domestic outdoor daytime activities in warmer months, and low public awareness of the disease. If dengue were to be reestablished in the U.S., it could have significant medical, public health, and economic consequences for the country. The impact of dengue as a public health threat could be lessened through enhanced awareness and reporting of cases, increased support for vector surveillance and control programs, and a greater focus on vaccine development.","['Franco, Crystal', 'Hynes, Noreen A', 'Bouri, Nidhi', 'Henderson, D A']","['Franco C', 'Hynes NA', 'Bouri N', 'Henderson DA']",,"['Center for Biosecurity of UPMC, Baltimore, Maryland 21202, USA. cfranco@upmc-bisoecurity.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biosecur Bioterror,"Biosecurity and bioterrorism : biodefense strategy, practice, and science",101156085,,IM,"['Animals', 'Culicidae', '*Dengue/etiology/transmission', 'Population Surveillance', 'Public Health', 'Risk Factors', 'United States']",,2010/08/20 06:00,2011/01/11 06:00,['2010/08/20 06:00'],"['2010/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/bsp.2010.0032 [doi]'],ppublish,Biosecur Bioterror. 2010 Sep;8(3):273-6. doi: 10.1089/bsp.2010.0032.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dengue fever is associated with a range of neurological manifestations. The objective of the present study was to determine the incidence of neurological signs and their predictive factors using data from cases of dengue seen and followed in Cayenne Hospital during the Dengue 2 epidemic in 2013. METHODS: In 2013, a longitudinal study using data from all cases of dengue seen in Cayenne hospital was collected. Medical records used a standardized form to collect demographic information, clinical signs and biological results and the date at which they were present. The analysis used Cox proportional modeling to obtain adjusted Hazard ratios. RESULTS: A total of 1574 patients were included 221 of whom developed central nervous system signs. These signs were spontaneously resolutive. There were 9298person days of follow-up and the overall incidence rate for central nervous system signs was 2.37 per 100 person-days. The variables independently associated with central nervous system anomalies were headache, Adjusted Hazard ratio (AHR) = 1.9(95%CI = 1.4-2.6), bleeding AHR = 2 ((95%CI = 1.3-3.1), P = 0.001, abdominal pain AHR = 1.9 ((95%CI = 1.4-2.6), P<0.001, aches AHR = 2.1 ((95%CI = 1.5-2.9), P<0.001, and fatigue AHR = 1.5 ((95%CI = 1.3-1.7), P<0.001. DISCUSSION: Overall, the present study suggests that neurological signs of dengue are not exceptional even in patients without the most severe features of dengue. These manifestations were spontaneously resolutive. Here it was not possible to distinguish between encephalitis or encephalopathy. Further studies would require more in depth exploration of the patients.","['Djossou, Felix', 'Vesin, Guillaume', 'Bidaud, Bastien', 'Mosnier, Emilie', 'Simonnet, Christine', 'Matheus, Severine', 'Prince, Christelle', 'Balcaen, John', 'Donutil, Gerd', 'Egmann, Gerald', 'Okandze, Antoine', 'Malvy, Denis', 'Nacher, Mathieu']","['Djossou F', 'Vesin G', 'Bidaud B', 'Mosnier E', 'Simonnet C', 'Matheus S', 'Prince C', 'Balcaen J', 'Donutil G', 'Egmann G', 'Okandze A', 'Malvy D', 'Nacher M']",,"['Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana.', ""Equipe d'Accueil EA3593 Ecosystemes Amazoniens et Pathologie Tropicale, Universite de Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana."", 'Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana.', 'Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana.', 'Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana.', 'Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana.', 'Laboratoire de virologie, Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana.', 'Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana.', ""Service d'accueil des Urgences/Service d'aide medicale urgente, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana."", ""Service d'accueil des Urgences/Service d'aide medicale urgente, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana."", 'Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana.', 'Unite des Maladies Tropicales et du Voyageur, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', ""Equipe d'Accueil EA3593 Ecosystemes Amazoniens et Pathologie Tropicale, Universite de Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana."", ""Centre d'Investigation Clinique Antilles Guyane, INSERM 1424, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne, Cayenne, French Guiana.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160316,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Central Nervous System Diseases/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Dengue/complications/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'French Guiana/epidemiology', '*Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Prognosis']",PMC4794179,2016/03/18 06:00,2016/08/03 06:00,['2016/03/17 06:00'],"['2015/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-15-42149 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0150828 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Mar 16;11(3):e0150828. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0150828. eCollection 2016.,3,,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, presence of four serotypes further complicates the prognosis. To investigate the predictors of disease severity and elucidate the prognostic markers among four dengue serotypes, this study was conducted on 320 inpatients having acute febrile illness clinically suspected as DI, over a period of five years. Dengue serotypes were confirmed by multiplex reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. Eighty patients were positive for DI with presence of Den-1, Den-2, Den-3, and Den-4 in 8, 35, 27 and 10 patients, respectively. The severe clinical manifestations, abdominal pain and hepatomegaly, were comparatively higher in Den-2 patients. Liver aminotransferases levels were also higher in Den-2 patients (app. 5 fold). This study clearly indicates the hyperendemicity of all dengue serotypes. Nucleotide sequencing of Envelope region revealed that the presently emerged Den-3 belongs to type III, having high homology with genotype responsible for number of outbreaks in 1980s. The re-emergence of this deadly type can be suspected to cause more outbreaks in future and is a matter of great concern.","['Kumaria, Rajni']",['Kumaria R'],,"['Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, National University of Singapore, Singapore. rankumaria@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Braz J Infect Dis,The Brazilian journal of infectious diseases : an official publication of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases,9812937,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serotyping', 'Severe Dengue/diagnosis/epidemiology/virology']",,2010/06/22 06:00,2010/09/21 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['S1413-8670(10)70027-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Braz J Infect Dis. 2010 Mar-Apr;14(2):141-6.,2,,,,,['Braz J Infect Dis. 2011 Mar-Apr;15(2):184-5.

Multiple inflammatory and regulatory cytokines, decoy receptors and vascular permeability factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both diseases. The differential pattern and dynamic of these soluble factors, and the relationship with clinical severity between pediatric dengue and sepsis could offer new diagnosis and therapeutic strategies. METHODS: We evaluated the concentration levels of 11 soluble factors with proinflammatory, regulatory and vascular permeability involvement, in plasma from children with dengue or sepsis, both clinically ranging from mild to severe, in the early, late and convalescence phases of the disease. RESULTS: During early acute infection, children with sepsis exhibited specific higher concentration levels of IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and its soluble decoy receptor II (sVEGFR2) and lower concentration levels of IL-10 and the soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (sTNFR2), in comparison with children with severe dengue. In addition, the circulating amounts of soluble ST2, and VEGF/sVEGFR2 were widely associated with clinical and laboratory indicators of dengue severity, whereas secondary dengue virus infections were characterized by an enhanced cytokine response, relative to primary infections. In severe forms of dengue, or sepsis, the kinetics and the cytokines response during the late and convalescence phases of the disease also differentiate. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue virus infection and septic processes in children are characterized by cytokine responses of a specific magnitude, pattern and kinetics, which are implicated in the pathophysiology and clinical outcome of these diseases.","['Salgado, Doris M', 'Rivera, Gina M', 'Pinto, William A', 'Rodriguez, Jairo', 'Acosta, Gladys', 'Castaneda, Diana M', 'Vega, Rocio', 'Perdomo-Celis, Federico', 'Bosch, Irene', 'Narvaez, Carlos F']","['Salgado DM', 'Rivera GM', 'Pinto WA', 'Rodriguez J', 'Acosta G', 'Castaneda DM', 'Vega R', 'Perdomo-Celis F', 'Bosch I', 'Narvaez CF']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0129-5210'],"['From the Departamento de Pediatria, Universidad Surcolombiana, E.S.E.

An unexpected large outbreak of dengue fever was reported in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China, in 2013. This was the first autochthonous outbreak with a significant proportion of severe dengue cases in mainland China in a decade. According to the 2009 World Health Organization guidelines, half of the 136 laboratory confirmed cases during the epidemic were severe dengue. The clinical presentation included severe haemorrhage (such as massive vaginal and gastrointestinal bleeding), severe plasma leakage (such as pleural effusion, ascites, or hypoproteinaemia), and organ involvement (such as myocarditis and lung impairment); 21 cases eventually deteriorated to shock. During this outbreak, all severe cases occurred in adults, among whom about 43% had co-morbid conditions. Nucleic acid detection and virus isolation confirmed dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) to be the pathogenic agent of this outbreak. Phylogenetic analyses of envelope gene sequences showed that these DENV-3 isolates belonged to genotype II. This finding is of great importance to understand the circulation of DENV and predict the risk of severe disease in mainland China. Here, we provide a brief report of the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and aetiology of this dengue fever outbreak, and characterize DENV strains isolated from clinical specimens.","['Zhang, Fu-Chun', 'Zhao, Hui', 'Li, Li-Hua', 'Jiang, Tao', 'Hong, Wen-Xin', 'Wang, Jian', 'Zhao, Ling-Zhai', 'Yang, Hui-Qin', 'Ma, De-Hong', 'Bai, Chun-Hai', 'Shan, Xi-Yun', 'Deng, Yong-Qiang', 'Qin, Cheng-Feng']","['Zhang FC', 'Zhao H', 'Li LH', 'Jiang T', 'Hong WX', 'Wang J', 'Zhao LZ', 'Yang HQ', 'Ma DH', 'Bai CH', 'Shan XY', 'Deng YQ', 'Qin CF']",,"[""Guangzhou 8th People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture People's Hospital, Xishuangbanna, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangzhou 8th People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangzhou 8th People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangzhou 8th People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangzhou 8th People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China; Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture People's Hospital, Xishuangbanna, People's Republic of China."", ""Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture People's Hospital, Xishuangbanna, People's Republic of China."", ""Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture People's Hospital, Xishuangbanna, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, People's Republic of China.

The goal was to studyAedes aegyptipopulation behaviour and that of affected people to scientifically support the decision-making involved in surveillance and control programmes. METHODS: The proposed mathematical model involved eight differential equations having constant delays; each represented each population's variation either in humans or the mosquito vector. RESULTS: Two of the mathematical model's simulation scenarios are presented; they were solved by means of an algorithm implemented in MATLAB software. The data was obtained from the Colombian Statistics Department (DANE), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and from a review of the pertinent literature.

In Venezuela, dengue has emerged as one of the most important public health problems of urban areas with frequent epidemics since 2001. The long-term pattern of this disease has involved not only a general upward trend in cases but also a dramatic increase in the size and frequency of epidemic outbreaks. By assuming that climate variability has a relevant influence on these changes in time, we quantified the periodicity of dengue incidence in time-series of data from two northern regions of Venezuela. Disease cycles of 1 and 3-4 years (p < 0.05) were detected. We determined that dengue cycles corresponded with local climate and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variation at both seasonal and inter-annual scales (every 2-3 years). Dengue incidence peaks were more prevalent during the warmer and dryer years of El Nino confirming that ENSO is a regional climatic driver of such long-term periodicity through local changes in temperature and rainfall. Our findings support the evidence of the effect of climate on dengue dynamics and advocate the incorporation of climate information in the surveillance and prediction of this arboviral disease in Venezuela.","['Vincenti-Gonzalez, M F', 'Tami, A', 'Lizarazo, E F', 'Grillet, M E']","['Vincenti-Gonzalez MF', 'Tami A', 'Lizarazo EF', 'Grillet ME']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2922-6751'],"['Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. a.tami@umcg.nl.', 'Departamento de Parasitologia, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Carabobo, Valencia, Venezuela. a.tami@umcg.nl.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia de Vectores y Parasitos, Instituto de Zoologia y Ecologia Tropical, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela. maria.grillet@ciens.ucv.ve.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180410,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,IM,"['*Climate', 'Dengue/*epidemiology/transmission/virology', '*Disease Outbreaks', '*El Nino-Southern Oscillation', 'Geography, Medical', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Seasons', 'Spatio-Temporal Analysis', 'Venezuela/epidemiology']",PMC5893565,2018/04/11 06:00,2019/10/02 06:00,['2018/04/12 06:00'],"['2017/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-24003-z [pii]', '24003 [pii]', '10.1038/s41598-018-24003-z [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Apr 10;8(1):5727. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-24003-z.,1,,,,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We compared differences in specificity and sensitivity between the old and the new guidelines for diagnosing dengue and assessed the usefulness in predicting the clinical course of the disease. Also, we investigated whether hypertension, diabetes or allergies, ethnicity or high age influenced the course of disease. RESULTS: In our setting, the old classification, compared with the new, had a marginally higher sensitivity for diagnosing dengue. The new classification had a slightly higher specificity and was less rigid. Patients with dengue who had warning signs as postulated in the new classification were admitted more often than those who had no warning signs (RR, 8.09 [1.80-35.48]). We did not find ethnicity, age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus or allergies to be predictive of the clinical course. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of returned travellers, the new classification system did not differ in sensitivity and specificity from the old system to a clinically relevant degree. The guidelines did not improve identification of severe disease.","['Wieten, Rosanne W', 'Vlietstra, Wytze', 'Goorhuis, Abraham', 'van Vugt, Michele', 'Hodiamont, Caspar J', 'Leenstra, Tjalling', 'de Vries, Peter J', 'Janssen, Saskia', 'van Thiel, Pieter P', 'Stijnis, Kees', 'Grobusch, Martin P']","['Wieten RW', 'Vlietstra W', 'Goorhuis A', 'van Vugt M', 'Hodiamont CJ', 'Leenstra T', 'de Vries PJ', 'Janssen S', 'van Thiel PP', 'Stijnis K', 'Grobusch MP']",,"['Center for Tropical Medicine and Travel Medicine, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120612,England,Trop Med Int Health,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,9610576,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Comorbidity', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/ethnology/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Socioeconomic Factors', '*Travel', 'White People', '*World Health Organization']",,2012/06/13 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.03020.x [doi]'],ppublish,Trop Med Int Health. 2012 Aug;17(8):1023-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.03020.x.

Diagnosis of dengue encephalopathy is based on clinically diagnosed DHF according to the W.H.O. criteria (1980), with CNS manifestations consisting of abrupt onset of hyperpyrexia, non-transient alteration of consciousness, headache, vomiting--with or without seizures--and normal CSF. Many factors may be considered to be directly or indirectly associated with CNS signs and symptoms in DHF, the main pathology being leakage of plasma into serous spaces and abnormal hemostasis, leading to hypovolemic shock and hemorrhage in many organs of the body. Acute liver failure is considered to be one of the main factors causing brain pathology. One hundred fifty-two cases of dengue encephalopathy admitted during 3 periods at the Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta were studied retrospectively. The overall incidence was 152 out of 2,441 DHF cases, or 6.2%. The most pronounced symptoms were hyperpyrexia, alteration of consciousness and convulsions. Laboratory examination showed an unusually high increase of serum transaminases, hyponatremia, and hypoxia.

This study was aimed to assess the clinical usefulness of the two classifications during a large dengue epidemic. METHODOLOGY: Clinical data of dengue patients admitted to selected units at National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Panadura Base Hospital and Nawaloka Hospital Colombo between June and August 2017 were collected prospectively. Cases were classified using the 1997 and 2009 WHO DCCs. RESULTS: 1,878 patients [adult = 1,573 (83.8%)] were studied. Based on 1997-WHO-DCC-DF (Dengue Fever): 1,316 (70.1%), DHF (Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever) -1: 468 (24.9%), DHF-2: 86 (4.6%) and DHF-3: 8 (0.4%). Based on 2009-WHO-DCC-Dengue with warning signs (WS): 1647 (87.7%), Dengue without WS: 231 (12.3%) and severe dengue (SD): 41 (2.18%). A total of 1,088 (82.7%) DF and 559 (99.5%) DHF patients developed WS. Of those without WS, 228 (17.3%) were DF patients and 3 (0.5%) were DHF patients. Three (0.23%) DF and 38 (6.76%) DHF patients had SD. All SD patients had WS. The level of agreement between the two systems of classification was poor (Kappa = - 0.035, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The 2009-WHO-DCC was more useful than 1997-WHO-DCC in predicting dengue disease severity as few DF patients also had SD. Furthermore, the presence of WS identified patients with SD. However, the 2009-WHO-DCC may not suit the resource limited countries as WS are non-specific, and lack of diagnostic tests can result in case overload.","['Jayarajah, Umesh', 'Dissanayake, Upul', 'Abeysuriya, Visula', 'De Silva, Pradeep K', 'Jayawardena, Priyankara', 'Kulatunga, Aruna', 'Fernando, Harshini', 'Madarasinghe, Manohari', 'Hapugoda, Damayanthi', 'Perera, Lakshika', 'Kannangara, Vibhavee', 'Udayangani, Champika', 'Peiris, Ranga', 'Faizer, Shuaib', 'Yasawardene, Pamodh', 'De Mel, Sanjay', 'De Zoysa, Ishan', 'Seneviratne, Suranjith L']","['Jayarajah U', 'Dissanayake U', 'Abeysuriya V', 'De Silva PK', 'Jayawardena P', 'Kulatunga A', 'Fernando H', 'Madarasinghe M', 'Hapugoda D', 'Perera L', 'Kannangara V', 'Udayangani C', 'Peiris R', 'Faizer S', 'Yasawardene P', 'De Mel S', 'De Zoysa I', 'Seneviratne SL']",,"['Dengue Unit, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka. umeshe.jaya@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medicine, Base Hospital, Panadura, Sri Lanka. upulpushpa.ud@gmail.com.', 'Nawaloka Hospital, Colombo, Sri Lanka. visulasrilanka@hotmail.com.', 'Dengue Unit, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka. mpkdesilva@yahoo.com.', 'Dengue Unit, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka. priyankara.jayawardana@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medicine, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka. kulatunga.aruna@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medicine, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka. harshi.fernando39@gmail.com.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Base Hospital, Panadura, Sri Lanka. manoharimd@gmail.com.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Base Hospital, Panadura, Sri Lanka. damayanthihapugoda@gmail.com.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. piumaliperera1278@gmail.com.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. kannagarav@gmail.com.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. champikaudukala2@gmail.com.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. rangapieris90.rp@gmail.com.', 'Dengue Research Group, Colombo, Sri Lanka. shuaibfaizer@gmail.com.', 'Dengue Research Group, Colombo, Sri Lanka. pcyasawardene@gmail.com.', 'Nawaloka Hospital, Colombo, Sri Lanka. wspdm199@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. ishandz@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. suran200@yahoo.co.uk.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200731,Italy,J Infect Dev Ctries,Journal of infection in developing countries,101305410,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Dengue Virus/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sri Lanka/epidemiology', 'World Health Organization']",,2020/08/15 06:00,2021/08/25 06:00,['2020/08/15 06:00'],"['2020/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3855/jidc.12468 [doi]'],epublish,J Infect Dev Ctries. 2020 Jul 31;14(7):781-787. doi: 10.3855/jidc.12468.,7,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Umesh Jayarajah, Visula Abeysuriya, Pradeep K de Silva,', 'Priyankara Jayawardena, Aruna Kulatunga, Harshini Fernando, Manohari', 'Madarasinghe, Damayanthi Hapugoda, Lakshika Perera, Vibhavee Kannangara, Champika', 'Udayangani, Ranga Peiris, Shuaib Faizer, Pamodh Yasawardene, Sanjay de Mel, Ishan', 'de Zoysa, Suranjith L Seneviratne.']",['NOTNLM'],"['1997 WHO dengue case definitions', '2009 WHO dengue case definitions', 'Sri Lanka', 'dengue virus infections']",['No Conflict of Interest is declared'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, estimating the risk of severe outcomes using clinical presentation or laboratory test results for rapid patient triage remains a challenge. Here, we aimed to develop prognostic models for severe dengue using machine learning, according to demographic information and clinical laboratory data of patients with dengue. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Out of 1,581 patients in the National Cheng Kung University Hospital with suspected dengue infections and subjected to NS1 antigen, IgM and IgG, and qRT-PCR tests, 798 patients including 138 severe cases were enrolled in the study. The primary target outcome was severe dengue. Machine learning models were trained and tested using the patient dataset that included demographic information and qualitative laboratory test results collected on day 1 when they sought medical advice. To develop prognostic models, we applied various machine learning methods, including logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting machine, support vector classifier, and artificial neural network, and compared the performance of the methods. The artificial neural network showed the highest average discrimination area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.8324 +/- 0.0268) and balance accuracy (0.7523 +/- 0.0273). According to the model explainer that analyzed the contributions/co-contributions of the different factors, patient age and dengue NS1 antigenemia were the two most important risk factors associated with severe dengue. Additionally, co-existence of anti-dengue IgM and IgG in patients with dengue increased the probability of severe dengue. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We developed prognostic models for the prediction of dengue severity in patients, using machine learning. The discriminative ability of the artificial neural network exhibited good performance for severe dengue prognosis. This model could help clinicians obtain a rapid prognosis during dengue outbreaks.

Various theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of severe forms of dengue, involving among other factors, features related to the virus, such as the presence of more virulent strains and/or strains with increased replicative capacity. A crucial point at this time is the discovery of a new viral type, dengue 5, from nonhuman primates in Malaysia-Borneo, which could result in greater difficulties for control and vaccine production (currently in efficacy tests). Once the circulation of this viral type has been demonstrated in the human population, the high risk of infection will have extreme or controversial public health implications. Therefore, a worldwide program to combat dengue should include an urgent need to implement continuous vector elimination, community education and prevention and control of the disease. Only then, we will be aiming to reduce the morbidity and transmission risk of dengue, while new technological and effective alternatives come about.","['Valero, Nereida', 'Quiroz, Yasmir']","['Valero N', 'Quiroz Y']",,,['spa'],"['Editorial', 'English Abstract']",,Venezuela,Invest Clin,Investigacion clinica,0421531,,IM,"['Dengue/*prevention & control/*virology', 'Dengue Virus/*classification', 'Humans', '*Serotyping']",,2014/10/03 06:00,2015/01/15 06:00,['2014/10/03 06:00'],"['2014/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Invest Clin. 2014 Sep;55(3):203-5.,3,,,,,,,,,Se complica la lucha contra el dengue ante el surgimiento de un nuevo serotipo viral?,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have focused on circulating lipids as potential biomarkers of dengue severity; however, the results obtained so far lack the consistency to establish a definite relationship between the two. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated serum lipids as potential biomarkers of dengue severity by conducting a meta-analysis of the currently available clinical data. Nine studies that evaluated 1,953 patients were included in the review, many of which were cross-sectional (44.4%) and conducted in Asian countries (55.5%). These studies observed the presence of lipids in serum samples (77%) of patients in the acute phase of the disease (88.8%). Circulating total-cholesterol (P = .001) and LDL (P = .001) levels, but not HDL (P = .07), VLDL (P = .9) and triglyceride (P = .57) levels, were inversely and significantly correlated with dengue severity. Total cholesterol (P </= .001) and LDL (P = .001) were also useful in determining the risk of hypovolemic shock in patients with severe dengue. Subgroup analysis showed that factors, such as design (cross-sectional vs cohort), racial-ethnic differences (Asian vs Latin Americans), and age range (children vs adult) influenced the correlation and also contributed to the high level of heterogeneity in the studies. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that total-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels should be explored as routine laboratory markers for dengue severity, as they will help in employing an appropriate patient therapy, and thus optimize the use of available resources.","['Lima, William Gustavo', 'Souza, Nayara Alves', 'Fernandes, Simone Odilia Antunes', 'Cardoso, Valbert Nascimento', 'Godoi, Isabella Piassi']","['Lima WG', 'Souza NA', 'Fernandes SOA', 'Cardoso VN', 'Godoi IP']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8946-9363'],"['Laboratorio de Radioisotopos, Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Faculdade de farmacia, Campus Pampulha, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Escola de Enfermagem, Campus Centro-oeste Dona Lindu, Universidade Federal de Sao Joao Del-rei, Divinopolis, MG, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Radioisotopos, Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Faculdade de farmacia, Campus Pampulha, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Radioisotopos, Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Faculdade de farmacia, Campus Pampulha, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Saude e Estudos Biologicos, Universidade Federal do Sul e Sudeste do Para, Maraba, Para, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20190606,England,Rev Med Virol,Reviews in medical virology,9112448,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Lipids)']",IM,"['*Biomarkers', 'Dengue/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Lipids/*blood', 'Prognosis', 'Publication Bias', 'Severe Dengue/blood/diagnosis', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,2019/06/07 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/06/08 06:00'],"['2019/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/rmv.2056 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Med Virol. 2019 Sep;29(5):e2056. doi: 10.1002/rmv.2056.

METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data were prospectively collected from workers who were hospitalized with fever. We compared the frequency of disease manifestations in these patients with historical data from other cases of dengue admitted to the same centre. A serological survey was performed at the construction site one month after the onset of the outbreak. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were admitted from the affected construction site with confirmed acute dengue infection in March and April 2002. Fever, headache and rash were common and occurred at similar frequency in outbreak patients and historical controls. Gastrointestinal manifestations were significantly more common in the outbreak patients compared with controls (nausea 68%, diarrhea 41%, hyponatremia 47% and elevated urea 20%). Of the 274 studied in the serological survey, 27 had serological evidence of acute dengue, of whom 24 (89%) had experienced a febrile illness in the previous month. The virus was cultured and identified as Dengue-2. Few patients had a positive IgG for dengue indicating that this was likely a primary infection.

Among 7,528 confirmed or probable travel-associated U.S. dengue cases reported during 2010-2021, one in five (1,474, 20%) was reported in 2019. This is 168% higher than the annual average number of cases reported during 2010-2018 and 2020-2021 (approximately 550 per year) and 61% higher than the 913 cases reported in 2016, the second highest year on record. The number of cases as a fraction of air traffic volume to international destinations outside North America or Europe was also highest in 2019, with 41.9 cases per million trips, compared with 21.0 per million in other years during 2010-2021. This report compares the number and characteristics of travel-associated dengue cases reported to national surveillance in the United States in 2019 with cases reported during 2010-2018 and 2020-2021. Areas with conditions suitable for dengue transmission as well as the population at risk for dengue are expected to increase, placing U.S. travelers at higher risk for infection. Health care providers should be aware that dengue is a common cause of fever in the returning traveler and be familiar with its signs and symptoms, testing, and management. Dengue vaccines are not currently recommended for U.S. travelers; therefore, persons should review areas of dengue risk and follow guidance for preventing mosquito bites.","['Wong, Joshua M', 'Rivera, Aidsa', 'Volkman, Hannah R', 'Torres-Velasquez, Brenda', 'Rodriguez, Dania M', 'Paz-Bailey, Gabriela', 'Adams, Laura E']","['Wong JM', 'Rivera A', 'Volkman HR', 'Torres-Velasquez B', 'Rodriguez DM', 'Paz-Bailey G', 'Adams LE']",,"['Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC.', 'Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC.', 'Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC.', 'Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC.', 'Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC.', 'Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC.', 'Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20230728,United States,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,MMWR.

This retrospective study involved 357 laboratory-confirmed cases of dengue infection diagnosed at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia over a 4-year period from 2014 to 2017. The sensitivity of the new classification for identifying severe cases was limited (65%) but higher than the old one (30%). It had a higher sensitivity for identifying patients who needed advanced healthcare compared to the old one (72% versus 32%, respectively). We propose adding decompensation of chronic diseases and thrombocytopenia-related bleeding to the category of severe dengue in the new classification. This modification improves sensitivity from 72% to 98% for identifying patients who need advanced healthcare without altering specificity (97%). It also improves sensitivity in predicting severe outcomes from 32% to 88%. In conclusion, the new classification had a low sensitivity for identifying patients needing advanced care and for predicting morbidity and mortality.

Serological interactions between dengue virus and other flaviviruses could drive antibody dependent enhancement, which is associated with disease severity in dengue infections. This effect may influence disease severity in individuals subsequently affected by related flaviviruses, such as dengue. We compare the severity of dengue episodes between patients vaccinated and non-vaccinated against yellow fever. METHODS: We evaluated the severity of 11,448 lab-confirmed dengue cases reported in Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Brazil, in 7370 YF vaccinated patients compared to 4043 unvaccinated patients. We regressed dengue severity against YF vaccine status and a number of demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables as controls. We also evaluated the association between YF vaccination status and the clinical and laboratory symptoms of dengue patients. RESULTS: We did not find any evidence of increased risk for severe dengue in patients vaccinated against YF (odds ratio = 1.00; 95% confidence interval = 0.87-1.14). Most of the variables analyzed did not have a statistically significant association with YF vaccination status. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that YF vaccination in dengue-endemic areas increases the risk of severe dengue fever.","['Luppe, Marina Jolli', 'Verro, Alice Tobal', 'Barbosa, Alana S', 'Nogueira, Mauricio L', 'Undurraga, Eduardo A', 'da Silva, Natal S']","['Luppe MJ', 'Verro AT', 'Barbosa AS', 'Nogueira ML', 'Undurraga EA', 'da Silva NS']",,"['Faculdade de Medicina, Uniao das Faculdades dos Grandes Lagos, Rua Dr. Eduardo Nielsem, 960 Jardim Novo Aeroporto, 15030-070, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Faculdade de Medicina, Uniao das Faculdades dos Grandes Lagos, Rua Dr. Eduardo Nielsem, 960 Jardim Novo Aeroporto, 15030-070, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Laboratorio de Modelagens Matematica e Estatistica em Medicina, Faculdade de Medicina, Uniao das Faculdades dos Grandes Lagos, Rua Dr. Eduardo Nielsem, 960 Jardim Novo Aeroporto, 15030-070, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Faculdade de Medicina, Uniao das Faculdades dos Grandes Lagos, Rua Dr. Eduardo Nielsem, 960 Jardim Novo Aeroporto, 15030-070, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Pesquisa em Virologia, Faculdade de Medicina de Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Av.

We were able to identify differences related to: formal assessment of problem, formation of groups of actors, and quantitative information provided by performance indicators. These limitations identified in IMS-dengue Colombia 2006-2010 were overcome in a new version of the strategy (IMS-dengue Colombia 2012-2021). We were able to document an epidemiological impact of implementation of IMS-dengue Colombia 2006-2010. Additionally, a gradual increase was observed in incidence rates of dengue cases that could be related to the strengthening of surveillance system of IMS- dengue Peru.","['Castro-Orozco, Raimundo', 'Alvis-Guzman, Nelson', 'Gomez-Arias, Ruben']","['Castro-Orozco R', 'Alvis-Guzman N', 'Gomez-Arias R']",,"['Universidad de San Buenaventura, Cartagena de Indias, Colombia.', 'Universidad de San Buenaventura, Cartagena de Indias, Colombia.', 'Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia.']",['spa'],['Journal Article'],,Peru,Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica,Revista peruana de medicina experimental y salud publica,101227566,,IM,"['Colombia/epidemiology', 'Dengue/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Peru']",,2016/01/07 06:00,2017/09/29 06:00,['2016/01/07 06:00'],"['2015/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['S1726-46342015000400025 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica. 2015 Oct;32(4):801-7.,4,,,,,,,,,Diferencias y similitudes entre las estrategias de gestion integrada para la prevencion y control del dengue en Colombia y Peru.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
