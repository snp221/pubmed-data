In this review, the underlying mechanism of action of paeonol in cardiovascular disease has been elucidated. Recent studies have revealed that paeonol treatment improved endothelium injury, demoted inflammation, ameliorated oxidative stress, suppressed vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, and repressed platelet activation. Paeonol has been reported to effectively protect the cardiovascular system either employed alone or in combination with other traditional medicines, thus, signifying it could be a hypothetically alternative or complementary atherosclerosis treatment.

Numerous studies show that ROS production is closely linked to the cell death process and promotes the occurrence and development of the cardiovascular diseases.

Cancer treatment has been associated with cardiovascular complications, among others cardiotoxicity of mediastinal radiation and certain chemotherapeutics. Identification of patients at high risk, prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases are emerging fields in cancer patients. Close interdisciplinary work between oncologists and cardiologists is pertinent for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and complications in cancer patients. Diagnostics and treatment applied to the individual case should be based on the available evidence in terms of patient-centered management. Further clinical research focused on the pathogenesis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases in cancer patients is warranted to pave the way to guidelines for this nonhomogeneous patient group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene therapy is emerging as a potential strategy for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, such as peripheral arterial disease, ischemic heart disease, restenosis after angioplasty, vascular bypass graft occlusion and transplant-associated coronary artery disease. Since the initial experiments more than one decade ago, remarkable progress has been made in the field of gene transfer and human clinical trials are underway. In here we give an overview of available gene transfer strategies describing several delivery routes and currently used vectors in animal studies and clinical trials. Hereby we want to focus on new approaches including the potential combination of gene therapy with cell therapy and tissue engineering, gene silencing and recently developed techniques for targeting genes to the vascular wall and the myocardium.",,,,,,,,,208,,,,,,,,,,,

Age-related modifications of the cardiovascular system are preserved by antiaging lifestyle interventions such as physical activity and caloric restriction. Accordingly, physical activity and low body mass index reduce mortality in older men with cardiovascular diseases. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the protective effect of lifestyle interventions against cardiovascular diseases in the elderly, including a reduction of vulnerability (i.e., the age-related reduction of endogenous mechanisms protective against pathologic insults). The age-related reduction of ischemic preconditioning, the most powerful endogenous protective mechanism against myocardial ischemia, is restored by both physical activity and caloric restriction. Thus, older persons can implement lifestyle practices that minimize their risk of death from cardiovascular diseases.",,,,,,,,,54,,,,,,,,,,,

As an emerging discipline, it has changed our conceptual thinking of cardiovascular development, disease etiology, and pathophysiology. Although molecular cardiology is still at a very early stage, it has opened a promising avenue for understanding and controlling cardiovascular disease. With the rapid development and application of molecular biological techniques, scientists and clinicians are closer to curing heart diseases that were thought to be incurable 20 yr ago. There clearly is a need for a more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases to promote the advancement of cell and gene therapy for heart diseases.

In pathophysiologic conditions RAAS also contributes to the development of atherosclerosis and its various manifestations, both directly and indirectly through the actions on other systems. RAAS mainly acts as a promoter of atherosclerosis by its action on vessels, and by promoting the development of hypertension, insulin resistance and diabetes, obesity, vascular and systemic inflammation. As RAAS plays a key role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, RAAS genes have been extensively studied as candidate genes for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Several polymorphisms of its genes have been found to be in relationship with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. In this review we will discuss these issues and present the most recent advances about this topic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2023 Aug 14.,12,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Observational studies have demonstrated that serum branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with the risk of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and their risk factors. However, the causal effect is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of genetically determined BCAA levels on CVDs and their risk factors using Mendelian randomization (MR). METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed univariable and multivariable MR analyses using summary-level data from multiple GWASs and the FinnGen consortium to investigate the association between BCAA levels and the risk of CVDs (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage) and their risk factors (atrial fibrillation, hypertension, heart failure, and valvular heart disease). We used the random-effects IVW approach as the primary statistical method and incorporated MR estimates from different data sources using the fixed-effects model. We found genetically determined total and individual BCAA levels and a high risk of hypertension. However, there is no evidence of a causal relationship between BCAA levels and 3 cardiovascular diseases and other their risk factors. The odds of hypertension increased per 1-SD increase in BCAA levels (OR = 1.02 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04; P = 0.005), valine (OR = 1.02 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03; P<0.0001), leucine (OR = 1.02 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04; P＜0.01), and isoleucine (OR = 1.02 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03; P < 0.0001). This result was also significant in the multivariable MR. CONCLUSIONS: This MR study suggests that total and individual BCAA levels could be associated with a high risk of hypertension.",,,['Declaration of competing interest The authors declared no conflict of interest.'],['NOTNLM'],"['Branched-chain amino acids', 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'Isoleucine', 'Leucine', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Valine']",,,['Copyright (c) 2023 The Author(s).

Recent progress in biochemical examinations for cardiovascular diseases includes measurement of troponin T, heart type fatty acid-binding protein, and LDL-cholesterol. Recent progress in genetic examinations includes analysis of mitochondrial DNA, obesity-related genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms. A safe and convenient system of collecting, transporting, and storing blood and other biological specimens, and the subsequent purification of genomic DNA from the stored specimens is available. Therefore, busy doctors and staff of clinical laboratory can plan subsequent DNA examinations without causing concern and pain. A recently reported human mutation of heterotrimeric G protein beta 3 subunit produces a gain-of-function G protein signaling abnormality. A common polymorphic base substitution, C825T, in the GNB3 gene is associated with an aberrantly spliced transcript lacking 123 nucleotides.

RECENT FINDINGS: There is emerging optimism that epigenetic mechanisms can provide the missing link to connect (epi)genomes with the cause of complex diseases. Environmental factors like intrauterine conditions during fetal development appear to preprogram humans for complex diseases. The purpose of this review is to summarize the newest results about the inheritable epigenetic features of cardiovascular diseases. Also, the recently discovered role of small RNAs in epigenetic gene regulation is discussed. SUMMARY: Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation will likely become major determinants in the pathogenesis of complex diseases and may offer new opportunities for the treatment of these diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, research on CVD and work during the last half of the 20th century is discussed. Second, the theories dominating the last 20 years are presented. Third, cardiovascular and occupational epidemiology are compared, and it is stressed that occupational epidemiology should avoid the individualistic bias of mainstream cardiovascular epidemiology. Finally, future challenges are discussed, and improvements are recommended concerning the use of intermediate end points, intervention research, theories about chemical and physical risk factors, the use of a unifying model for society, stress, and health, and the application of integrated prevention. It is concluded that research on CVD and work can play an important part in the development of integrated prevention strategies for the next century.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This guide recommends the SCORE model for risk evaluation. The aim is to prevent premature mortality and morbidity due to CVD by means of dealing with its related risk factors in clinical practice. The guide focuses on primary prevention and emphasizes the role of the nurses and primary care doctors in promoting a healthy life style, based on increasing physical activity, changing dietary habits, and not smoking. The therapeutic goal is to achieve a Blood Pressure < 140/90 mmHg, but in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or definite CVD, the objective is < 130/80 mmHg. Serum cholesterol should be < 200 mg/dl and cLDL < 130 mg/dl, although in patients with CVD or diabetes, the objective is < 100 mg/dl (80 mg/dl if feasible in very high-risk patients). Patients with type 2 diabetes and those with metabolic syndrome must lose weight and increase their physical activity, and drugs must be administered whenever applicable, with the objective guided by body mass index and waist circumference. In diabetic type 2 patients, the objective is glycated haemoglobin < 7%. Allowing people to know the guides and developing implementation programs, identifying barriers and seeking solutions for them, are priorities for the CEIPC in order to put the recommendations into practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,['Comite Espanol Interdisciplinario para la Prevencion Cardiovascular'],Guia Europea de Prevencion Cardiovascular en la Practica Clinica.

The treatment to be first considered for cardiac tamponade is percardiocentesis and tube pericardiotomy. It is important to improve cardiac function by prompt drainage after diagnosis with cardiac ultrasonography. To avoid recurrence of cardiac tamponade, pericardial fenestration and instillation of anticancer agents into the pericardium are sometimes added.

Its implementation in clinical practice raises numerous questions related to its estimation, practical use and consequences for the health system. This new approach to cardiovascular diseases does not aim to cure a complaint but to try to avoid its appearance by means of restricting measures. This will modify the relationships between physician and patient and will imply major modifications of our treatment habits.

AIM: To get an idea about the relationship between inflammation in the blood vessels, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular consequences based on the study of the role of biomarkers of inflammation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: the literature on the estimation of risk development of cardiovascular diseases based on the study of the role of biomarkers of vascular inflammation; bibliographic, a systematic approach. RESULTS: Algorithm stratification of cardiovascular risk includes a review of the traditional risk factors for the purpose of preventive therapy. A large number of cases of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke) occurs in bessimptomnom patients with normal lipid. The use of additional risk factors for development of cerebral and cardiac disorders will allow to foresee the consequences and to prevent mortality from cardiovascular disease. Study of the role of inflammation in development of cardiovascular diseases allows the use of SB and PL-capital EF, Cyrilliccapital EL, Cyrilliccapital A, Cyrillic2 as an important additional cardiovascular markers, independent of traditional risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The use of biomarkers LP-capital EF, Cyrilliccapital EL, Cyrilliccapital A, Cyrillic2 and SB specific to vascular inflammation, allows to establish the relationship between endovascular inflammation, atherosclerosis development and progression of cardiovascular diseases and to prevent cerebral and cardiac disorders in patients with traditional risk factor .",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['biomarkers', 'cardiovascular disease', 'cerebrovascular disease', 'the instability of the plaque', 'inflammation in the blood vessels']",,['0 (Biomarkers)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence, both at tissue level and in the circulation, of increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines suggests that immune activation might be a relevant mechanism contributing to cardiac as well as peripheral manifestations of the disease. Traditional cardiovascular drugs have little influence on the cytokine network. Results from randomized, placebo controlled anti-TNF studies suggest lack of effect of such therapy, but the concept of immune modulation is still intensively studied.

Many of these entities are associated with serious morbidity and mortality resulting from cardiac impairment, ischemic complications, or organ dysfunction, particularly of the kidneys, lung, and nervous system. The systemic nature of these conditions, coupled with vague symptoms and nonspecific initial physical findings, makes the differential diagnosis complicated. Research has identified specific mediators and primary origins in some conditions, with infections often being responsible. Immunosuppressive therapy, despite the potential complications, has improved the prognosis of some of the more serious immunologic cardiovascular diseases. Improvement in the treatment of immunologic cardiovascular diseases awaits identification of additional causes, improved definition of host factors that predispose an individual to develop these conditions, and better understanding of the immune dysregulation responsible for the progression of disease. The potential pathophysiologic role of immunologic mechanisms in common disorders such as congestive heart failure and atherosclerosis is intriguing and offers the possibility of novel therapies in these prevalent conditions.",,,,,,,,,58,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To identify important modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and appropriate interventions. DISCUSSION: The three most important modifiable risk factors are hypertension, cigarette smoking, and dyslipidemia. Systolic hypertension poses a greater risk than diastolic, but the prognostic significance of diastolic blood pressure may have been underestimated. When a smoker quits, the cardiovascular risk soon approaches that of the nonsmoker. Cardiovascular risk increases progressively with elevations of the serum total cholesterol level above 200 mg/dL. Recently identified risk factors include hyperinsulinemia and left ventricular hypertrophy. CONCLUSION: Each patient deserves an evaluation of cardiovascular risk followed by education about and therapy for those risk factors that can be changed. When more than one risk factor is present, as is often the case, the increase in risk may be synergistic rather than additive.",,,,,,,,,44,,,,,,,,,,,

The microbiota itself, and the dysbiosis of the gut flora, are correlated to the onset and progress of diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis. Herbal medicine (HM) plays a role in modulating gut microbiota and is widely used in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, and hyperlipidemia. In this review, we focus on the relationship between the microbiota-metabolism-immunity (MMI) axis and CVD (including its risk factors) and the beneficial effects of HM to regulate this crosstalk.

MP circulate in human plasma and also accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions. A growing body of evidence has highlighted their involvement in inflammation, angiogenesis, coagulation, and the regulation of vascular tone. MP may therefore contribute to the initiation and development of atherosclerosis and its complications. Plasma MP originate from platelets, leukocytes, erythrocytes, and endothelial cells, and their levels increase in patients with cardiovascular diseases; specific cardiovascular medications also affect plasma MP levels.

The highest rates that were reported in the mid sixties in Finland occurred in 1990/91 occurred in central and eastern Europe. The reasons for such different development of cardiovascular mortality have not been explained yet. The epidemy of cardiovascular diseases in post-socialist countries may be only partially associated with high prevalence of the three classical risk factors (hypercholesterolemia, smoking, hypertension). Presumably other, yet unrecognized risk factors have potentiated the classical ones (psychosocial stress, specific nutritional deficiencies). A decrease in mortality from cardiovascular diseases can be attributed to improvements in care of patients with cardiovascular diseases, mainly with coronary heart disease including AMI, with favourable effects on survival and to a decline in risk factors prevalence or to a combination of both. Similar detailed information for Slovakia is lacking. Therefore it is difficult to predict the future incidence of cardiovascular diseases and AMI in Slovakia. The authors in the review article focused on some epidemiological and preventive aspects of cardiovascular diseases and their implementation at present. In order to achieve a reversal of the unfavourable trend of cardiovascular mortality it is insufficient only to answer the basic questions, as e.g., what was the reason for such differing trends in disease rates and mortality from cardiovascular diseases in our country (and in post-socialist countries of central and eastern Europe) and e.g. in Finland or in the U.S.A., where cardiovascular mortality decreased almost by half. For the appropriate formulation of prevention measures with a focus on cardiovascular diseases, detailed analysis of the current specific situation in our country is also necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Poznamky k epidemiologii a prevencii kardiovaskularnych chorob po roku 1989.,,,,,,

Hypertension (38.1%) was the second most common cause of heart disease. It affects mostly young people and 77% of the cases are of essential type. The incidences of atherosclerotic and congenital heart disease have not changed but that of syphilitic heart disease and cardiomyopathy have markedly decreased in the last 20 years. The incidences of rheumatic and hypertensive heart diseases have shown a significant increase.

Improvements in life expectancy at birth lead to predictable shifts in the cause-of-death structure over time. The stage at which cardiovascular diseases may be considered to be 'actively emerging' corresponds to a life expectancy level between 50 and 60 years and, at this level, cardiovascular disease mortality accounts for 15-25% of all deaths. The average life expectancy at birth in developing countries for the year 2000 is projected to be 60 years or more and it may be expected that by that time cardiovascular diseases would be actively emerging or established in virtually every country. In many developing countries today, life-style pattern that is associated with high rates of coronary heart disease is not yet widespread and it is therefore logical that a strategy of prevention should include efforts to inhibit the entrenchment and spread of unhealthy life-styles in the community (i.e., primordial prevention). At the country level, cardiovascular disease prevention and control cannot be considered in isolation and must be related to prevailing national health priorities and competing claims from other sectors of development. In poorer countries where life expectancy is below 50 years primordial prevention activities are likely to be restricted--perhaps to smoking and hypertension control. In middle-income countries a broader based approach to primordial prevention is feasible and is more likely to be acceptable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondly, the circadian pattern of myocardial infarction is well known to feature a prominent increase in the morning hours. Taken together, these factors may provide an opportunity to reduce deaths caused by cardiovascular disease. Findings indicate that, in many cases, plaque disruption and thrombus formation are triggered by the activities of the patient. It is postulated that onset occurs when a 'vulnerable' atherosclerotic plaque becomes disrupted and occlusive thrombus formation occurs. The occurrence of a myocardial infarction in the morning hours could result from the synchronization of a number of potential triggers. The importance of the recognition of the circadian variation of acute onset of myocardial infarction is that pharmacologic protection can be directed at the early waking hours. It would seem reasonable to propose that long-acting anti-ischemic agents would have an advantage over short-acting agents in providing protection against the morning occurrence of myocardial infarction. A future goal would be to design therapeutic regimens that would have the ability to sever the linkage between a potential triggering activity and the development of myocardial infarction.",,,,,,,,,13,,,,,,,,,,,

The released products of mast cells include histamine, proteases, as well as a variety of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, which act on the surrounding microenvironment thereby shaping the immune responses triggered in various diseased states. Mast cells have also been detected in the arterial wall and are implicated in the onset and progression of numerous cardiovascular diseases. Notably, modulation of distinct mast cell actions using genetic and pharmacological approaches highlights the crucial role of this cell type in cardiovascular syndromes. The acquired evidence renders mast cells and their mediators as potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in a broad spectrum of pathophysiological conditions related to cardiovascular diseases.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aneurysm', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Diabetes', 'Mast cells', 'Myocardial infarction', 'Obesity', 'Restenosis']",,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

High throughput analyses, termed ""omics"", are a promising avenue of research. These recently developed technical fields have revolutionized biological and medical research in a very short time.

To reduce this social and economic burden there is urgency to find effective therapeutic targets. Several studies have linked the dysfunction of the Sympathetic Nervous System and beta-adrenergic receptor signaling with the pathogenesis of age-related cardiovascular diseases. Therapeutic treatments that restore their functions have been shown to be effective in subjects with cardiovascular comorbidities. In fact, lifestyle interventions (such as exercise training and diet) as well as pharmacologic treatments (e.g. beta-blockers or moxonidine) and mini-invasive interventions (renal sympathetic denervation) have beneficial effects on age-related cardiovascular diseases. In the current ""Medicine in focus"" article we will discuss the pathogenic role of the Sympathetic Nervous System in age-related cardiovascular diseases as well as current and new therapeutic approaches.",,PMC6383565,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adrenergic nervous system', 'Aging', 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'beta-Adrenergic signaling']",['P01 HL091799/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This has been named evolutionary medicine. When individuals with a genetic program for retention of sodium and calories (insulin resistance) encounter the stress and unwholesome lifestyle of modern society, cardiovascular disease may soon develop, potential consequences being myocardial infarction or stroke. Focusing on historical changes in climate, social circumstances and food availability in the Nordic countries, factors which very much defined living conditions for our ancestors, we discuss cardiovascular disease from the point of view of evolutionary medicine. A better understanding of this perspective will hopefully increase the likelihood of success in preventive efforts such as lifestyle intervention.",,,,,,,,,35,,,,,Evolutionsbiologiska ron kan oka forstaelsen av hjart--karlsjukdom.

Besides small noncoding RNAs (eg, microRNAs), >200-nucleotide long transcripts, namely long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), can interfere with gene expressions and signaling pathways at various stages. In the cardiovascular system, studies have detected and characterized the expression of lncRNAs under normal physiological condition and in disease states. Several lncRNAs are regulated during acute myocardial infarction (eg, Novlnc6) and heart failure (eg, Mhrt), whereas others control hypertrophy, mitochondrial function and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. In the vascular system, the endothelial-expressed lncRNAs (eg, MALAT1 and Tie-1-AS) can regulate vessel growth and function, whereas the smooth-muscle-expressed lncRNA smooth muscle and endothelial cell-enriched migration/differentiation-associated long noncoding RNA was recently shown to control the contractile phenotype of smooth muscle cells. This review article summarizes the data on lncRNA expressions in mouse and human and highlights identified cardiovascular lncRNAs that might play a role in cardiovascular diseases. Although our understanding of lncRNAs is still in its infancy, these examples may provide helpful insights how lncRNAs interfere with cardiovascular diseases.",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA, long noncoding', 'angiogenesis effect', 'atherosclerosis', 'heart failure', 'hypertrophy']",,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']","['(c) 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The great promise of mRNA therapeutics was highlighted by the speed at which the vaccines were created, tested, and proven to be relatively safe and highly effective. There are a wide variety of mRNA therapeutics now under development, and dozens of these are in clinical trials. These therapeutics are generating a major paradigm shift in medical therapy, including the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Most of the cardiovascular mRNA therapies are still in preclinical development, although a phase 2a trial of mRNA therapy for myocardial ischemia has been completed with promising results.(1) The application of mRNA therapies to cardiovascular diseases is virtually limitless, and ongoing work includes mRNA therapies for myocardial ischemia, heart failure, arrhythmias, hypercholesterolemia, and arterial occlusive diseases. In addition, mRNA may be used to enhance cell therapies. In the future, mRNA therapies for cardiovascular disease are destined to supplant some of our current biologics and pharmacotherapies and will be used to treat previously untreatable cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, mRNA therapies can be personalized, and they can be rapidly generated in current Good Manufacturing Practice facilities with a modest footprint, facilitating the rise of hospital-based regional centers of RNA therapeutics.","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0033-9138', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2535-7973']",PMC9733127,"['Dr. Cooke is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board for Humann, the founder of', 'Cooke Consulting, and has a sponsored research agreement with VGXI Inc.

Structural and functional alterations of vessels accumulate throughout life, culminating in increased risk of developing CVD. The growing elderly population worldwide highlights the need to understand how aging promotes CVD in order to develop new strategies to confront this challenge. This review provides examples of some major unresolved clinical problems encountered in daily cardiovascular practice as we care for elderly patients. Next, the authors summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms implicated in cardiovascular aging, and the potential for targeting novel pathways implicated in endothelial dysfunction, mitochondrial oxidative stress, chromatin remodeling, and genomic instability.

Possible causes of the decline in the coronary heart disease mortality rate include the development of the concept of acute coronary care, new drugs, sophisticated surgical techniques such as coronary artery bypass, noninvasive diagnostic methods for earlier disease detection, and the identification of specific cardiovascular risk factors. The decrease has been temporarily related to increased risk factor awareness and modification (cigarette smoking cessation, hypertension control, diet change and reduction in cholesterol). Thus, both primary prevention through lifestyle changes and improved treatment regimens have played a role in the decline. Recent studies showing the benefit of cholesterol reduction emphasize the potential for even greater decreases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Observational studies suggested a bidirectional association between cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders and its components. However, the causal associations between them remained unclear. This study aims to investigate the causal relationship between metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. METHODS: A two-sample MR analysis based on publicly available genome-wide association studies were used to infer the causality. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms with potential pleiotropy were excluded by MR-PRESSO. The effect estimates were constructed using the random-effects inverse-variance-weighted method as the primary estimate. Furthermore, MR-Egger and weighted median were also performed to detect heterogeneity and pleiotropy. RESULTS: Genetically predicted metabolic disorders increased the risk for coronary heart disease (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.55-2.03, p < 0.001), myocardial infarction (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.52-2.03, p < 0.001), heart failure (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.14-1.39, p < 0.001), hypertension (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.02, p = 0.002), and stroke (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08-1.32, p < 0.001). The concordance of the results of various complementary sensitivity MR methods reinforces the causal relationship further. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of a causal relationship between metabolic disorders and increased risk of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, hypertension, and stroke. Special attention should be paid to improving metabolic disorders to reduce the development of cardiovascular diseases.",,PMC10617200,"['The authors declare no competing interests.

We also elaborate on the molecular regulators and the molecular cascades along with their specific genetic aspects involved in modulating circadian rhythms, with specific reference to cardiovascular health and cardiovascular diseases. Along with this, we also presented the latest pharmacogenomic and metabolomics markers involved in chronobiological control of the cardiovascular system along with their possible utility in cardiovascular disease diagnosis and therapeutics.

Possibilities to achieve this both in the curative and the preventive field are restricted mainly due to the insufficient knowledge of their etiopathogenesis. Although the cause is not known, the discovery to risk factors provides a sound evidence for prevention. Attempts to reverse elevated risk factor levels are all directed towards a more healthy way of life. Group oriented prevention is one of the most frequently applied approaches to test the hypothesis of preventability. While it offers many advantages, the delayed timing of the intervention and the restricted coverage limits the possibility of inference from its results. The community approach implies acting on the whole population by changing their behaviour towards a more healthy way of life. Apart from the beneficial ""side effects"" on other chronic diseases, their outcome in the pilot areas may be inferred to the total population.

Epub 2012 Sep 27.,5,"Cardiovascular primary prevention and regeneration programs are the contemporary frontiers in functional metabolic vascular medicine. This novel science perspective harnesses our inherent ability to modulate the interface between specialized gene receptors and bioavailable nutrients in what is labeled as the nutrient-gene interaction. By mimicking a natural process through the conveyance of highly absorbable receptor specific nutrients, it is feasible to accelerate cell repair and optimize mitochondrial function, thereby achieving cardiovascular cure. We performed a comprehensive review of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Review databases for articles relating to cardiovascular regenerative medicine, nutrigenomics and primary prevention, with the aim of harmonizing their roles within contemporary clinical practice. We searched in particular for large-scale randomized controlled trials on contemporary cardiovascular pharmacotherapies and their specific adverse effects on metabolic pathways which feature prominently in cardiovascular regenerative programs, such as nitric oxide and glucose metabolism. Scientific research on 'cardiovascular-free' centenarians delineated that low sugar and low insulin are consistent findings. As we age, our insulin level increases. Those who can decelerate the rapidity of this process are prompting their cardiovascular rejuvenation. It is beginning to dawn on some clinicians that contemporary treatments are not only failing to impact on our most prevalent diseases, but they may be causing more damage than good. Primary prevention programs are crucial elements for a better outcome. Cardiovascular primary prevention and regeneration programs have enhanced clinical efficacy and quality of life and complement our conventional endovascular practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall each of the two interventions would be expected to avert about one million deaths per year throughout Asia in 2020. These benefits would be approximately additive. About half a million deaths might be averted annually by each intervention in China alone, with about four-fifths of this benefit due to averted stroke. The relative benefits of these two strategies are similar to estimates made for US and UK populations.

Increasing evidence has shown that the electromagnetic field (EMF) influences many biological processes, which has attracted much attention for its potential therapeutic and diagnostic modalities in multiple diseases, such as musculoskeletal disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Nonionizing EMF has been studied as a therapeutic or diagnostic tool in CVDs. In this review, we summarize the current literature ranging from in vitro to clinical studies focusing on the therapeutic potential (external EMF) and diagnostic potential (internal EMF generated from the heart) of EMF in CVDs. First, we provided an overview of the therapeutic potential of EMF and associated mechanisms in the context of CVDs, including cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, atherosclerosis, and hypertension. Furthermore, we investigated the diagnostic and predictive value of magnetocardiography in CVDs. Finally, we discussed the critical steps necessary to translate this promising approach into clinical practice.","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1600-5570', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1237-1696', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0004-7127', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7453-0387', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7352-0563']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['cardiovascular diseases', 'electromagnetic fields', 'magnetic field therapy', 'magnetocardiography']",,,['(c) 2023 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

As for the biological functions, the GA plays a major role in protein biosynthesis, post-translational modification, and sorting protein from ER to plasma membrane and other destinations. Structural changes and functional disorder of the GA is associated with various diseases. Moreover, increasing evidence revealed that swelling, poor development, and other morphological alterations of the GA are linked to cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure (HF), arrhythmia, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, dysfunction of the GA is also related to cardiovascular diseases since the GA is extremely responsible for transport, glycosylation, biosynthesis, and subcellular distribution of cardiovascular proteins. This review gives a brief overview of the intricate relationship between the GA and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, we provide a further prospective that the GA may provide diagnosis reference for cardiovascular diseases, and changes in the ultrastructure and morphology of the GA such as swelling, poor development, and fragmentation may serve as a reliable index for cardiovascular diseases.",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2787-3018'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['arrhythmia', 'cardiac hypertrophy', 'dilated cardiomyopathy', 'swelling', 'the Golgi apparatus']",,['0 (Proteins)'],"['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypertension (HT) is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease. The impact of psychosocial factors, personality traits, genetic-behavioral interactions, sodium sensitivity, obesity, insulin metabolism, and psychophysiology on HT status is discussed. An understanding of pathophysiologic processes is needed to provide a better basis for risk factor reduction and other aspects of treatment. The study of myocardial ischemia appears to provide an important link between the development of coronary artery disease and the occurrence of CHD. Further studies are needed to assess the clinical significance of stress-induced myocardial ischemia as well as whether mental stress is predictive of future CHD. Associations have been made between behavioral risk factors and CHD, but the exact nature of the relationship remains to be clarified. Hostility has been identified as an important aspect of coronary-prone behavior, but considerable research will have to be completed before a comprehensive understanding of coronary-prone behavior and the manner in which it has an impact on disease can be fully understood.",,,,,,,,,150,,,,,,,,,,,

Focusing on examples drawn from four cardiovascular diseases - coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease - we argue that ethnicity, culture and context matter in determining the risk factors for disease as well as the comparative effectiveness of medications and other interventions, particularly diet and lifestyle interventions. CONCLUSION: We believe that a host of cohort studies and randomized control trials currently being conducted or planned in low- and middle-income countries, focusing on previously understudied race/ethnic groups, have the potential to increase knowledge about the cause(s) and management of cardiovascular diseases across the world.",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3172-834X'],PMC6979081,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],['NOTNLM'],"['Cardiovascular disorders', 'Low- and middle-income countries', 'Race/ethnicity']","['K24 DK085446/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007357/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early accurate diagnosis and new preventive and treatment strategies are among the potential benefits of genetic understanding. Many genes and mutations have been discovered that contribute to rare Mendelian forms of cardiovascular disease. However, there has been little tangible success in defining specific mutations that explain the more common forms of cardiovascular disease. Of the numerous genes tested, inconsistent results are a recurring theme. METHODS: This review addresses broader issues that touch on the clinical and epidemiological context in which the genetics of cardiovascular disease might develop. How do genes and environment interact in cardiovascular disease? What characteristics of a marker might make it useful? How will genetic understanding be used? What is the place of physiology in molecular biology? Is the future of genetics in patient management or public health? RESULTS: It is concluded that individuals and communities are unlikely to accept widespread DNA screening, and less likely to tolerate genetic manipulation. Genetic complexity will make the identification of specific mutations an expensive and potentially thankless task. CONCLUSIONS: Genetics may reveal new pathophysiological mechanisms against which simple, safe and effective public health measures can bring benefit to the greatest number.",,,,,,,,,25,,,,,,,,,,,
