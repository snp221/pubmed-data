This review examines the scientific evidences on the impact of climate change on human infectious diseases. It identifies research progress and gaps on how human society may respond to, adapt to, and prepare for the related changes. Based on a survey of related publications between 1990 and 2015, the terms used for literature selection reflect three aspects--the components of infectious diseases, climate variables, and selected infectious diseases. Humans' vulnerability to the potential health impacts by climate change is evident in literature. As an active agent, human beings may control the related health effects that may be effectively controlled through adopting proactive measures, including better understanding of the climate change patterns and of the compound disease-specific health effects, and effective allocation of technologies and resources to promote healthy lifestyles and public awareness. The following adaptation measures are recommended: 1) to go beyond empirical observations of the association between climate change and infectious diseases and develop more scientific explanations, 2) to improve the prediction of spatial-temporal process of climate change and the associated shifts in infectious diseases at various spatial and temporal scales, and 3) to establish locally effective early warning systems for the health effects of predicated climate change.",['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

Many other infectious diseases including puerperal fever, relapsing fever, malaria, syphilis, meningitis, tetanus and gangrene caused thousands of deaths. This review of preventive measures, public health interventions and changes in behavior that reduced the risk of severe infections puts the response to recent epidemic challenges in historical perspective. Two new respiratory viruses have recently caused pandemics: an H1N1 influenza virus genetically related to pig viruses, and a bat-derived coronavirus causing COVID-19. Studies of infectious diseases emerging in human populations in recent decades indicate that the majority were zoonotic, and many of the causal pathogens had a wildlife origin. As hunter-gatherers, humans contracted pathogens from other species, and then from domesticated animals and rodents when they began to live in settled communities based on agriculture. In the modern world of large inter-connected urban populations and rapid transport, the risk of global transmission of new infectious diseases is high. Past and recent experience indicates that surveillance, prevention and control of infectious diseases are critical for global health.

Until a decade and half ago, IDs were the major cause of both morbidity and mortality accounting 70% for both. However, as a result of various preventive measures implemented by both the state and non-state actors, the overall IDs have shown a changing (declining) trend. The most impressive decline has been seen in the intestinal helminth infection. Though the overall burden of IDs is decreasing, several newer infectious diseases (emerging infections) namely, dengue fever, scrub typhus, influenza (H5N1 and H1N1), and others are posing a great public health problem. On the other hand, though sporadic, outbreaks of endemic diseases together with HIV-TB coinfection and infection with drug resistance microbes during recent years have constituted a serious public health as well as medical problem. On the contrary, with the decline of IDs, noninfectious diseases (noncommunicable disease, NCD) namely, diabetes, cancer (and cancer therapy), and others are on the rise particularly in urban areas. Hence, currently Nepal is trapped in ""double burden"" of diseases. Risk of opportunistic infection has increased in immunocompromised person with NCD.

In 1996 an article in this journal predicted a crisis in infectious diseases, which subsequently unfolded with a paucity of new drugs, increases in antimicrobial resistance, and underdevelopment in both immunotherapy and diagnostics. This article argues that the root cause of the current-day problems lies in the enormous success of the mid-20th century antibiotic revolution. The availability of low-toxicity broad-spectrum drugs fostered a culture of empiricism and widespread use, which in turn stunted the development of both the specialty and rapid diagnostics while promoting increases in resistance. Two decades later, there are promising signs that widespread recognition of these problems is leading to fundamental changes in the approach to the therapy of infectious diseases.

Notably, 5 notifiable infectious diseases have been almost eradicated, and the incidence of 18 additional notifiable infectious diseases has been significantly reduced. Unexpectedly, the incidence of over 10 notifiable infectious diseases, including HIV, brucellosis, syphilis, and dengue fever, has been increasing. Nevertheless, frequent infectious disease outbreaks/events have been reported almost every year, and imported infectious diseases have increased since 2015. New pathogens and over 100 new genotypes or serotypes of known pathogens have been identified. Some infectious diseases seem to be exacerbated by various factors, including rapid urbanization, large numbers of migrant workers, changes in climate, ecology, and policies, such as returning farmland to forests.

In order to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and develop effective diagnostic tools, therapeutic agents, and preventive vaccines, a suitable animal model which can represent the characteristics of infectious is required. The Syrian hamster immune responses to infectious pathogens are similar to humans and as such, this model is advantageous for studying pathogenesis of infection including post-bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens, along with assessing the efficacy and interactions of medications and vaccines for those pathogens. This review summarizes the current status of Syrian hamster models and their use for understanding the underlying mechanisms of pathogen infection, in addition to their use as a drug discovery platform and provides a strong rationale for the selection of Syrian hamster as animal models in biomedical research.

Developing nations, with the least resources to respond, bear the greatest burden of this threat. However, with the potential to spread rapidly and ubiquitously, infectious diseases present a significant risk to the health and development of all nations. No country or population is immune, and geographic and political barriers offer little protection. Many factors facilitate the spread of infectious diseases, including globalization of travel and trade, weakening of national and international public health infrastructure, deterioration of socioeconomic conditions, and heightened political and civil strife in some developing nations. These conditions render populations more vulnerable to infections and provide an environment conducive to the transmission of infectious diseases. Compounding these risk factors is the emergence of another threat: antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial drugs are rapidly losing their effectiveness because of their misuse.

The potential impact of mobility, travel, population growth, trade and globalization on infectious disease dynamics against the background of a changing climate, land use, air quality and urbanization on individual, population, ecosystem and planetary health were addressed. Speakers at the conference were encouraged to put forth their talks into stand-alone manuscripts, which resulted in a unique collection of 13 articles, now brought together into a thematic issue of Acta Tropica.

Among 10 categories of IDTEs, foodborne and waterborne IDTEs were the most common, vaccine-preventable IDTEs caused the highest number of cases, and airborne IDTEs caused the most deaths. Observed drivers for each IDTE were sorted into three main groups: globalization and environmental drivers contributed to 61% of all IDTEs, public health system drivers contributed to 21%, and social and demographic drivers to 18%. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that four of the top five drivers for observed IDTEs were in the globalization and environment group. In the observational study, the globalization and environment group was related to all IDTE categories, but only to five of eight categories in the foresight study.

These include what factors commonly facilitate transmission of pathogens to novel host species, what drives variation in immune investment among host species, and more generally what drives global patterns of parasite diversity and distribution? Here we consider how the perspectives and tools of macroecology, a field that investigates patterns and processes at broad spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales, are expanding scientific understanding of global infectious disease ecology. In particular, emerging approaches are providing new insights about scaling properties across all living taxa, and new strategies for mapping pathogen biodiversity and infection risk. Ultimately, macroecology is establishing a framework to more accurately predict global patterns of infectious disease distribution and emergence.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.'],"['Stephens, Patrick R', 'Altizer, Sonia', 'Smith, Katherine F', 'Alonso Aguirre, A', 'Brown, James H', 'Budischak, Sarah A', 'Byers, James E', 'Dallas, Tad A', 'Jonathan Davies, T', 'Drake, John M', 'Ezenwa, Vanessa O', 'Farrell, Maxwell J', 'Gittleman, John L', 'Han, Barbara A', 'Huang, Shan', 'Hutchinson, Rebecca A', 'Johnson, Pieter', 'Nunn, Charles L', 'Onstad, David', 'Park, Andrew', 'Vazquez-Prokopec, Gonzalo M', 'Schmidt, John P', 'Poulin, Robert']","['Stephens PR', 'Altizer S', 'Smith KF', 'Alonso Aguirre A', 'Brown JH', 'Budischak SA', 'Byers JE', 'Dallas TA', 'Jonathan Davies T', 'Drake JM', 'Ezenwa VO', 'Farrell MJ', 'Gittleman JL', 'Han BA', 'Huang S', 'Hutchinson RA', 'Johnson P', 'Nunn CL', 'Onstad D', 'Park A', 'Vazquez-Prokopec GM', 'Schmidt JP', 'Poulin R']","['Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 30602, USA.', 'Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 30602, USA.', 'Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Brown University, Providence, RI, 0291, USA.', 'Department of Environmental Science and Policy, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, 22030, USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA.', 'Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 30602, USA.', 'Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 30602, USA.', 'Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 30602, USA.', 'Department of Biology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, H3A 0G4, Canada.', 'Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 30602, USA.', 'Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 30602, USA.', 'Department of Biology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, H3A 0G4, Canada.', 'Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 30602, USA.', 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Millbrook, New York, 12545, USA.', 'Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (BiK-F), Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung, Senckenberganlage 25, 60325, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, 97331, USA.', 'Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, 80309, USA.', 'Biological Sciences, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, USA.', 'ITD Data Analysis and Modelling, DuPont Agricultural Biotechnology, Experimental Station E353/317, Wilmington, DE, 19803, USA.', 'Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 30602, USA.', 'Department of Environmental Sciences, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA.', 'Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 30602, USA.', 'Department of Zoology, University of Otago, Dunedin, 9054, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20160628,England,Ecol Lett,Ecology letters,101121949,IM,"['Biodiversity', '*Communicable Diseases/epidemiology/etiology/transmission/veterinary', 'Ecology/methods', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Biodiversity', 'conservation', 'disease ecology', 'infectious diseases', 'macroecology', 'pathogens']",2016/06/30 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2016/06/30 06:00'],"['2016/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ele.12644 [doi]'],ppublish,Ecol Lett. 2016 Sep;19(9):1159-71. doi: 10.1111/ele.12644.

Renal transplant recipients (RTRs) benefit from a longer life expectancy, with a better quality of life. Despite, recent accomplishments in the field of kidney transplantation, both short- and long-term, surgical and medical complications still exist. Among these complications, cardiovascular disease, carcinogenesis and infections are the most important. Infectious diseases constitute the most common complications after renal transplantation and the second most common cause of death among RTRs with a functioning graft. Theoretically, all infectious pathogens could cause disease in immunocompromised RTRs, yet among these, one could identify more important ones, such as the Enterobacteriaceae, causing urinary tract infections; pneumonia due to Pneumocystis jirovecii; Candida species which cause invasive fungal infections; herpes viruses; hepatitis viruses and parasites. Early diagnosis and effective treatment are key elements in salvaging both the allograft and the patient. However, clinical manifestations and diagnosis of such infectious diseases are not easily identified due to the altered state of immune response of the RTR. Thus, apart from possessing a deep knowledge of the etiology and the treatment options in each case, transplant physicians should also always remain alert when dealing with RTRs.","['Copyright (c) 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Anastasopoulos, Nikolaos-Andreas', 'Duni, Anila', 'Peschos, Dimitrios', 'Agnantis, Niki', 'Dounousi, Evangelia']","['Anastasopoulos NA', 'Duni A', 'Peschos D', 'Agnantis N', 'Dounousi E']","['Department of Surgery, Medical School, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.', 'Department of Nephrology, University Hospital of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Physiology, Medical School, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, Medical School, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.', 'Department of Nephrology, University Hospital of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece evangeldou@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,"['Central Nervous System Infections/diagnosis/etiology', 'Communicable Diseases/*diagnosis/*etiology/microbiology/parasitology/virology', 'Cross Infection', 'Gastroenteritis/diagnosis/etiology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications/therapy', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/diagnosis/etiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Kidney transplantation', 'classification', 'etiology', 'immunosuppression', 'infectious diseases', 'review']",2015/07/02 06:00,2016/04/07 06:00,['2015/07/02 06:00'],"['2015/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['29/4/415 [pii]'],ppublish,In Vivo. 2015 Jul-Aug;29(4):415-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying mechanisms of sex differences in infectious diseases are manifold, including differences in exposure to common pathogens, genetic factors that modulate immune responses against pathogens and hormonal factors that may alter susceptibility or disease progression, and responsiveness to treatment. On one hand, these mechanisms lead to higher innate and adaptive immune responses in females, which result in faster clearance of acute infections and higher antibody responses to several vaccines, on the other hand this contributes to an increased susceptibility to chronic inflammatory diseases. In this review we summarize the underlying causes of sex differences in prevalence, clinical course of disease and treatment outcome of infectious diseases.

They are capable of sensing organisms ranging from protozoa to bacteria, fungi or viruses upon detection of the pathogen as well as recognizing endogenous ligands, and triggering transduction pathways. Following activation of the innate immune system, strong inflammatory signals are generated inducing inflammation and activation of the adaptive immune response. However, the deregulation of TLRs signaling pathways may be conducive to the pathogenesis of many infectious diseases. Therefore, innate and adaptive immunity are not simply sequential and complementary mechanisms of resistance to pathogen, they regulate each other through cellular contacts and the secretion of soluble mediators. Herein, we summarize recent findings on TLRs signaling in infectious diseases and how pathogens have developed strategies to evade these pathways.

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: Infectious diseases occur as the result of interactions between hosts and microorganisms. There is an increasing acceptance that the evolution of host and parasite is important in the development of infectious diseases. However, such views have made little impact in nursing, and the use of evolutionary interventions remains controversial. METHOD: The Medline database was searched from 1966 to present using the terms pathogen$, virulen$, evolution, bacteria, and all combinations of these. Additionally reference lists of text books and papers were hand searched for relevant papers. Papers were selected from a variety of disciplines, including infectious diseases, microbiology, evolutionary biology, and ecology. Recurrent themes from these papers were identified and a model of evolutionary nursing constructed. RESULTS: Microorganisms are plentiful, ubiquitous, and rapidly evolving by comparison with humans and other animals. As a result of this, attempts to 'outwit' them have been, and are, doomed to failure. However, through careful management of public and personal health, a balance encouraging co-existence may be possible. A number of specific interventions is proposed. CONCLUSIONS: There are a number of key interventions that may reduce the virulence of microorganisms. With an increasing world population, antibiotic resistance and international travel, such an approach may be one way of reducing the morbidity associated with infectious diseases.",,"['Purssell, Edward']",['Purssell E'],"[""King's College London, Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery, London, UK. edward.purssell@kcl.ac.uk <edward.purssell@kcl.ac.uk>""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,J Adv Nurs,Journal of advanced nursing,7609811,IM,"['Biological Evolution', 'Communicable Disease Control', 'Communicable Diseases/microbiology/*nursing/transmission', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Virulence']",,,,2005/01/12 09:00,2005/05/20 09:00,['2005/01/12 09:00'],"['2005/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['JAN3276 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2648.2004.03276.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Adv Nurs. 2005 Jan;49(2):164-72. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2004.03276.x.,,,,,,38,,,,,,,,,,,

An emerging and unifying theme in the pathogenesis of these diverse public health threats is changes in the microbial communities that inhabit multiple body sites. Although there is great promise in exploring the role of these microbial communities in chronic disease pathogenesis, the shorter timeframe of most infectious disease pathogenesis may allow early translation of our basic scientific understanding of microbial ecology and host-microbiota-pathogen interactions. Likely translation avenues include development of preventive strategies, diagnostics, and therapeutics. For example, as basic research related to microbial pathogenesis continues to progress, Clostridioides difficile infection is already being addressed clinically through at least 2 of these 3 avenues: targeted antibiotic stewardship and treatment of recurrent disease through fecal microbiota transplantation.","['Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of', 'America 2021.']","['Ranallo, Ryan T', 'McDonald, L Clifford', 'Halpin, Alison Laufer', 'Hiltke, Thomas', 'Young, Vincent B']","['Ranallo RT', 'McDonald LC', 'Halpin AL', 'Hiltke T', 'Young VB']","['Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', 'Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', 'Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, The University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],['Introductory Journal Article'],,United States,J Infect Dis,The Journal of infectious diseases,0413675,IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Communicable Diseases/diagnosis/immunology/*microbiology/therapy', '*Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Fecal Microbiota Transplantation', 'Homeostasis', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immunity', '*Microbiota/drug effects']",PMC8206797,['NOTNLM'],"['Microbiota', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'host', 'infectious disease', 'pathogen']",2021/03/06 06:00,2021/10/02 06:00,['2021/03/05 17:08'],"['2021/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2021/03/05 17:08 [entrez]']","['6154668 [pii]', 'jiab020 [pii]', '10.1093/infdis/jiab020 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect Dis. 2021 Jun 16;223(12 Suppl 2):S187-S193. doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiab020.,,,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],,,,"['U01 AI124255/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CK000481/CK/NCEZID CDC HHS/United States', 'U54 CK000607/CK/NCEZID CDC HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

With the occurrence of AIDS and the discovery of new pathogens the come-back of infectious diseases was noted, 15 to 20 years later, and the concept of emerging infections was defined. An emerging infection is the appearance of a new infection or the increase of its incidence if not new. It also includes infections for which the incidence could increase because of favorable conditions. Several scenarios can be proposed: 1) the appearance of a new infection (AIDS or SARS); 2) the appearance of a known infection where it did not exist previously (West Nile virus infection in the USA); 3) an infection that existed but that was not diagnosed or could not be linked precisely to a particular infectious agent (hepatitis C before the discovery of the hepatitis C virus; 4) a known infection that increases its usual incidence (outbreaks...); 5) infectious diseases for which current conditions may facilitate transmission (decrease of immunization coverage...). The deliberate release of a biological agent is one of the possible scenarios of emergence.

However, throughout the history of transfusion medicine, many infectious diseases arose or were recognised, bringing up an impact on the blood supply, as the difficulties in diagnosing new diseases, the decrease in blood donors, the challenges for the medical team, the risks for the receptor and the related costs. This study aims to review historically the principal infectious diseases transmitted through the blood that circulated worldwide in the 20th and 21st centuries, considering the impact on the blood banks. Despite the current blood bank control of transfusion risks and the hemovigilance improvements, transmitted and emerging infections can still compromise the blood bank supply, as we have witnessed during the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It appears possible that common viral and bacterial infections can increase the susceptibility to stroke by promoting atherosclerosis, inflammation, and local thrombosis. Stroke commonly leads to disruption of protective mechanisms against infection and induces a cascade of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive reactions, which greatly increases the risk of infection. The social and economic costs of post-stroke infections and their impact on stroke morbidity and outcome are dramatic. Understanding the pathophysiologic links between stroke and infection is therefore of paramount importance, and effective preventive strategies to reduce the risk of infection are needed.

They have pioneered disease prevention from the Crusades to the World Wars and continue to do so today. Predeployment vaccinations and chemoprophylaxis are effective in preventing communicable disease, as is reliable vector destruction and bite prevention, especially in the era of multidrug resistant organisms. These measures are unlikely to be fully possible in disasters, but reactive vaccination and efforts to reduce exposure to communicable disease should be a priority. Communicable diseases can be challenging to diagnose-the UK Defence Medical Services have become familiar with tools such as multiplex PCR and mass spectrometry. These have the potential to accurately identify organisms and sensitivity patterns in austere environments. Management of communicable diseases depends on accurate diagnosis and has a largely well-established evidence base but can be limited by a lack of resources and skills in an austere setting, therefore telemedicine can assist diagnosis and treatment of infections by projecting specialist skill. Systems such as EpiNATO2 are useful in monitoring diseases and identifying trends in order to establish control measures. Many of these tools and techniques are effective in austere environments and offer learning opportunities for those providing care in similar settings. Further research is ongoing into diagnostic tools as well as remote management.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. No commercial re-use. See rights and', 'permissions.

In a population attacked by an infectious agent, individuals can be conveniently divided into three categories: totally resistant organisms which contain no susceptible structures and are not affected; mildly susceptible organisms in which a few foci appear and in which the infection runs a benign course; organisms in which the number of constitutionally susceptible structures is high and the infectious process develops in a severe form.

This conference brought together distinguished thought leaders in animal health, veterinary diagnostics, epidemiology and disease surveillance, and agricultural economics. The conference's primary objective was to review the lessons learned from past experiences in dealing with high-consequence animal infectious diseases to inform an action plan to prepare for future epizootics and panzootics. Invited speakers and panel members comprised world-leading experts in animal infectious diseases from federal state agencies, academia, professional societies, and the private sector. The conference concluded that the biosecurity of livestock operations is critical for minimizing the devastating impact of emerging animal infectious diseases. The panel also highlighted the need to develop and benchmark cutting-edge diagnostics for rapidly detecting pathogens in clinical samples and the environment. Developing next-generation pathogen agnostic diagnostics will help detect variants of known pathogens and unknown novel pathogens. The conference also highlighted the importance of the One Health approach in dealing with emerging animal and human infectious diseases.

The most common travel-related illnesses appear to be gastrointestinal, dermatologic, respiratory, and systemic febrile syndromes. The pretravel medical consultation includes immunizations, malaria chemoprophylaxis, self-treatment for traveler's diarrhea, and advice on the prevention of a myriad of other infectious causes including dengue, chikungunya, rickettsiosis, leptospirosis, schistosomiasis, and strongyloidiasis. Travel to locations experiencing outbreaks such as Ebola virus disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and chikungunya call for specific alerts on preventive strategies. After travel, evaluation of an ill traveler must explore details of exposure, including destinations visited; activities; ingestion of contaminated food or drinks; contact with vectors, animals, fresh water, or blood and body fluids; and other potential exposures. Knowledge of the geographic distribution of infectious diseases is important in generating the differential diagnoses and testing accordingly. Empiric treatment is sometimes necessary when suspicion of a certain diagnosis is strong and confirmatory tests are delayed or lacking, particularly for infections that are rapidly progressive (for example, malaria) or for which timing of testing is prolonged (such as leptospirosis).",,"['Chen, Lin H', 'Blair, Barbra M']","['Chen LH', 'Blair BM']","['Mount Auburn Hospital, Cambridge, MA 02138.', 'Mount Auburn Hospital, Cambridge, MA 02138.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Microbiol Spectr,Microbiology spectrum,101634614,IM,"['Communicable Disease Control', 'Communicable Diseases/*epidemiology/microbiology/transmission/virology', 'Humans', 'Risk', 'Travel/*statistics & numerical data']",,,,2015/09/10 06:00,2016/04/15 06:00,['2015/09/10 06:00'],"['2015/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1128/microbiolspec.IOL5-0005-2015 [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Spectr. 2015 Aug;3(4). doi: 10.1128/microbiolspec.IOL5-0005-2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The surveillance of infectious diseases has recently assumed greater importance in most African countries, both because of the emergence of infectious diseases and because strains of pathogens that cause tuberculosis, malaria, cholera, dysentery, and pneumonia have developed resistance to common and inexpensive antimicrobial drugs. However, data on the pathogen-specific causes of infectious diseases are limited. Developing research in infectious and tropical diseases in Africa is urgently needed to better describe the distribution of pathogen-borne diseases and to know which pathogens actually cause fever. This research is critical for guiding treatment and policies in Africa. More effective diagnostics are also needed for these diseases, which often are misdiagnosed or diagnosed too late.

The multiagent description leads to the study of the evolution over time of a system of kinetic equations for the wealth densities of susceptible, infectious, and recovered individuals, whose proportions are driven by a classical compartmental model in epidemiology. Explicit calculations show that the spread of the disease seriously affects the distribution of wealth, which, unlike the situation in the absence of epidemics, can converge toward a stationary state with a bimodal form. Furthermore, simulations confirm the ability of the model to describe different phenomenon characteristics of economic trends in situations compromised by the rapid spread of an epidemic, such as the unequal impact on the various wealth classes and the risk of a shrinking middle class.",,"['Dimarco, Giacomo', 'Pareschi, Lorenzo', 'Toscani, Giuseppe', 'Zanella, Mattia']","['Dimarco G', 'Pareschi L', 'Toscani G', 'Zanella M']","['Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Ferrara, Via N.

Taiwan is a country which is going through the process of becoming ""developed"" from being ""developing"". If we compare five leading causes of death in 1952 and in 1993, three were infectious diseases in 1952 and there was none in 1993. And yet today, infectious diseases remain a major problem in this country as well in every country in the world, whether developing or developed. Some of the problems Taiwan faces are old problems with old faces. They have never been adequately solved because the societal and environmental sanitary infrastructure does not ensure proper sewage disposal, safe potable water and freedom from dangerous vectors. Examples are the diarrheal diseases, parasitic diseases, scrub typhus and Japanese encephalitis. Some of the Taiwan's problems are caused by old agents which present a new face. Mortality from tuberculosis took a dramatic and gratifying plunge in the last fifty years. Yet tuberculosis is ever present and a constant public health threat. Dengue has become a problem again because of a world breakdown in the control of the mosquito, Aedes egypti, and it is partly contributed to by increased urbanization and world travel. The problem of antibiotic resistant bacteria causing hospital acquired and community acquired infections is probably the most serious ""new"" problem. The most important cause is excessive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics in the community and in hospitals. We propose the establishment of ""Bacterial Infections Reference Laboratory"" at the National Health Research Institutes to be a national facility to study the epidemiology and control of antibiotic resistance. All infectious diseases require a rigorous system of surveillance, and precise etiological diagnosis before they can be treated or prevented. This should be kept clearly in mind when one considers the changing role of the infectious disease physician in Taiwan in the face of unsolved disease problems and a new health care system.

The remarkable diversity of human infectious diseases that have been modeled in the macaque includes global, childhood, and tropical diseases as well as newly emergent, sexually transmitted, oncogenic, degenerative neurologic, potential bioterrorism, and miscellaneous other diseases. Historically, macaques played a major role in establishing the etiology of yellow fever, polio, and prion diseases. With rare exceptions (Chagas disease, bartonellosis), all of the infectious diseases in this review are of Old World origin. Perhaps most surprising is the large number of tropical (16), newly emergent (7), and bioterrorism diseases (9) that have been modeled in macaques. Many of these human diseases (e.g., AIDS, hepatitis E, bartonellosis) are a consequence of zoonotic infection. However, infectious agents of certain diseases, including measles and tuberculosis, can sometimes go both ways, and thus several human pathogens are threats to nonhuman primates including macaques. Through experimental studies in macaques, researchers have gained insight into pathogenic mechanisms and novel treatment and vaccine approaches for many human infectious diseases, most notably acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Other infectious agents for which macaques have been a uniquely valuable resource for biomedical research, and particularly vaccinology, include influenza virus, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, arenaviruses, hepatitis E virus, papillomavirus, smallpox virus, Mycobacteria, Bacillus anthracis, Helicobacter pylori, Yersinia pestis, and Plasmodium species.

Quantitative genetic analyses of binary disease status, however, indicate low heritability for most diseases, which restricts the rate of genetic reduction in disease prevalence. Moreover, the common liability threshold model suggests that eradication of an infectious disease via genetic selection is impossible because the observed-scale heritability goes to zero when the prevalence approaches zero. From infectious disease epidemiology, however, we know that eradication of infectious diseases is possible, both in theory and practice, because of positive feedback mechanisms leading to the phenomenon known as herd immunity. The common quantitative genetic models, however, ignore these feedback mechanisms. Here, we integrate quantitative genetic analysis of binary disease status with epidemiological models of transmission, aiming to identify the potential response to selection for reducing the prevalence of endemic infectious diseases. The results show that typical heritability values of binary disease status correspond to a very substantial genetic variation in disease susceptibility among individuals. Moreover, our results show that eradication of infectious diseases by genetic selection is possible in principle. These findings strongly disagree with predictions based on common quantitative genetic models, which ignore the positive feedback effects that occur when reducing the transmission of infectious diseases. Those feedback effects are a specific kind of Indirect Genetic Effects; they contribute substantially to the response to selection and the development of herd immunity (i.e., an effective reproduction ratio less than one).","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

The dramatic expansion of cities around the world creates new conditions for the spread, surveillance, and control of infectious diseases. In particular, urban growth generates pronounced spatial heterogeneity within cities, which can modulate the effect of climate factors at local spatial scales in large urban environments. Importantly, the interaction between environmental forcing and socioeconomic heterogeneity at local scales remains an open area in infectious disease dynamics, especially for urban landscapes of the developing world. A quantitative and conceptual framework on urban health with a focus on infectious diseases would benefit from integrating aspects of climate forcing, population density, and level of wealth.

Travellers visiting friends and relatives (VFR) have a particularly high risk of acquiring certain infections during travel. Chinese VFR travellers account for a substantial proportion of all travel in Western countries with high migrant populations. METHODS: A literature review was undertaken regarding major infectious disease risks for VFR travellers visiting China. This included an examination of the previous pandemics arising in China, the likelihood of future outbreaks in China from H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses, the potential role of travellers in disease transmission, and the special risks for VFR travellers. RESULTS: China has been the origin of several influenza pandemics in past few decades, and the origin of several emerging infectious diseases with pandemic potential, including SARS. Travel to and from China has the potential for global spread of emergent infectious diseases, as seen in the SARS outbreak in 2003. For VFR travellers, the risk of other infectious diseases may also be greater in China compared to their countries of migration, including hepatitis A and B, dengue fever, typhoid, and other diseases. CONCLUSIONS: VFR travel to China may be associated with increased risk of acquiring a range of infectious diseases, and also poses a potential risk for importation of future pandemics to other countries. Chinese VFR travellers need to be cognisant of these risks and health professionals should consider educational interventions to minimise these risks.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It can integrate clinical observation with microbiology and immunology to incorporate the role of the host response into the outcome of microbial pathogenesis. Although the role that microbial factors may play in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases is well recognized, the DRF brings the indispensable role of the host response to the fore. For example, inflammation may induce microbial control, but it can also produce host damage. On the other hand, insufficient inflammation may fail to induce sufficient microbial control. Each scenario may lead to the diagnosis of an infectious disease. Given the central role that the host response plays in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, new strategies for treatment need to consider the nature of the host response as well as microbial factors.",,"['Pirofski, Liise-Anne', 'Casadevall, Arturo']","['Pirofski LA', 'Casadevall A']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Infect Dis,The Journal of infectious diseases,0413675,IM,"['Allergy and Immunology', 'Communicable Diseases/*etiology/immunology/microbiology/pathology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Microbiology', '*Physicians', '*Research Personnel']",PMC6093430,,,2018/08/21 06:00,2019/09/17 06:00,['2018/08/21 06:00'],"['2018/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['5073083 [pii]', 'jiy083 [pii]', '10.1093/infdis/jiy083 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect Dis. 2018 Aug 14;218(suppl_1):S7-S11. doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiy083.,,,,,,,"['R01 AI123654/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI097096/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL059842/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG045044/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI033774/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI060354/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI033142/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI052733/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Since 2016, the German Society for Infectious Diseases (DGI) has constantly designed new items in this regard. Here we report the most recent recommendations. METHODS: The recommendations of the DGI are part of the ""Klug entscheiden"" initiative of the German Society of Internal Medicine (DGIM). Topics for the new items were suggested by members of the DGI, checked for scientific evidence and consented within the DGI and the DGIM before publication. RESULTS: The new recommendations are: (1) individuals with immune-suppression, advanced liver cirrhosis or renal insufficiency should receive a dual pneumococcal vaccination. (2) In case of positive blood cultures with Candida spp. thorough diagnostics and treatment should be initiated. (3) In case of suspected meningitis, adult patients should receive dexamethasone and antibiotics immediately after venipuncture for blood cultures and before potential imaging. (4) In case of suspected meningitis a CT scan before lumbar puncture should not be ordered-except for symptoms indicating high CSF pressure or focal brain pathology or in cases of severe immune-suppression. (5) In patients with suspected severe infections, a minimum of two pairs of blood cultures should be drawn using separate venipunctures prior to antibiotic therapy-regardless of body temperature. There is no need of a minimum time interval in between the blood draws. CONCLUSION: Applying these new Choosing Wisely((R)) recommendations will increase patient safety and the value of health care.",,"['Draenert, Rika', 'Jung, Norma']","['Draenert R', 'Jung N']","['LMU Klinikum, Stabsstelle Antibiotic Stewardship, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany. rika.draenert@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200310,Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,IM,"['Communicable Diseases/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', '*Delivery of Health Care', 'Germany', 'Humans', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', '*Societies, Medical']",PMC7256090,['NOTNLM'],"['Blood cultures', 'Choosing Wisely', 'Infectious diseases', 'Meningitis', 'Vaccination']",2020/03/12 06:00,2020/10/07 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2020/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s15010-020-01400-z [pii]', '1400 [pii]', '10.1007/s15010-020-01400-z [doi]']",ppublish,Infection. 2020 Jun;48(3):317-321. doi: 10.1007/s15010-020-01400-z.

This study aimed to explore the capacity of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) in China to deal with infectious diseases now and in the future. METHODS: A survey was conducted in 2015 among 973 public health professionals at CDCs in Beijing and four provinces, to assess their capacity to deal with emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. RESULTS: Although most professionals were confident with the current capacity of CDCs to cope with outbreaks, nearly all indicated more funding was required to meet future challenges. Responses indicated that Yunnan Province faced more challenges than Anhui, Henan and Liaoning Provinces in being completely prepared and able to deal with outbreaks. Participants aged 20-39 years were more likely than those aged 40 and over to believe strategies such as interdisciplinary and international collaborations for disease surveillance and control, would assist capacity building. CONCLUSION: The capacity of China's CDCs to deal with infectious diseases was excellent. However, findings suggest it is imperative to increase the number of skilled CDC staff, financial support, and strengthen county level staff training and health education programs.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Many of the ethical issues raised by infectious diseases are related to these diseases' powerful ability to engender fear in individuals and panic in populations. We address the association of some infectious diseases with high morbidity and mortality rates, the sense that infectious diseases are caused by invasion or attack on humans by foreign micro-organisms, the acute onset and rapid course of many infectious diseases, and, in particular, the communicability of infectious diseases. The individual fear and community panic associated with infectious diseases often leads to rapid, emotionally driven decision making about public health policies needed to protect the community that may be in conflict with current bioethical principles regarding the care of individual patients. The discussion includes recent examples where dialogue between public health practitioners and medical-ethicists has helped resolve ethical issues that require us to consider the infected patient as both a victim with individual needs and rights and as a potential vector of disease that is of concern to the community.",,"['Smith, Charles B', 'Battin, Margaret P', 'Jacobson, Jay A', 'Francis, Leslie P', 'Botkin, Jeffrey R', 'Asplund, Emily P', 'Domek, Gretchen J', 'Hawkins, Beverly']","['Smith CB', 'Battin MP', 'Jacobson JA', 'Francis LP', 'Botkin JR', 'Asplund EP', 'Domek GJ', 'Hawkins B']","['Division of Medical Ethics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112 USA. battin@utah.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Dev World Bioeth,Developing world bioethics,101120122,,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Anti-Infective Agents/economics/therapeutic use', 'Attitude', 'Biological Warfare', 'Communicable Disease Control', '*Communicable Diseases/mortality/therapy/transmission', 'Developing Countries', '*Health Policy', 'Humans', 'Public Health/*ethics', 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Tuberculosis']",,['KIE'],['Health Care and Public Health'],2004/04/17 05:00,2004/09/01 05:00,['2004/04/17 05:00'],"['2004/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['DEWB64 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-8731.2004.00064.x [doi]']",ppublish,Dev World Bioeth. 2004 May;4(1):1-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-8731.2004.00064.x.,,,['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)'],,,,,,,,,['KIE: 115290'],,,"['KIE: 32 fn.', 'KIE: KIE Bib: public health']",,

Establishing surveillance and control programmes for EIDs requires substantial and long-term commitment of resources that are limited in nature. This contrasts with the unquantifiable number of possible zoonotic and non-zoonotic infectious diseases that may emerge, even when the focus is restricted to diseases involving livestock. Such diseases may emerge from many combinations of, and changes in, host species, production systems, environments/habitats and pathogen types. Given these multiple elements, risk prioritisation frameworks should be used more widely to support decision-making and resource allocation for surveillance. In this paper, the authors use recent examples of EID events in livestock to review surveillance approaches for the early detection of EIDs, and highlight the need for surveillance programmes to be informed and prioritised by regularly updated risk assessment frameworks. They conclude by discussing some unmet needs in risk assessment practices for EIDs, and the need for improved coordination in global infectious disease surveillance.",,"['Drewe, J A', 'Snary, E L', 'Crotta, M', 'Alarcon, P', 'Guitian, J']","['Drewe JA', 'Snary EL', 'Crotta M', 'Alarcon P', 'Guitian J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,France,Rev Sci Tech,Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),8712301,IM,"['Animals', '*Communicable Diseases, Emerging/diagnosis/prevention & control/veterinary', 'Livestock', 'Risk Assessment', 'Ecosystem']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Control', 'Early detection', 'Emerging infectious disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Hazard', 'Livestock', 'Maladie emergente', 'Prevention', 'Production systems', 'Risk assessment']",2023/05/26 13:09,2023/05/29 06:42,['2023/05/26 06:03'],"['2023/05/29 06:42 [medline]', '2023/05/26 13:09 [pubmed]', '2023/05/26 06:03 [entrez]']",['10.20506/rst.42.3355 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Sci Tech. 2023 May;42:120-127. doi: 10.20506/rst.42.3355.,,,,,,,,,Surveillance and risk assessment for early detection of emerging infectious diseases in livestock.,,,,,,,,

The recent proliferation of such diseases has raised major social and economic concerns. Therefore, early detection of emerging infectious diseases is essential. Subjects from five medical institutions in Beijing, China, which met the spatial-specific requirements, were analyzed. A quality control process was used to select 37,422 medical records of infectious diseases and 56,133 cases of non-infectious diseases. An emerging infectious disease detection model (EIDDM), a two-layer model that divides the problem into two sub-problems, i.e., whether a case is an infectious disease, and if so, whether it is a known infectious disease, was proposed. The first layer model adopts the binary classification model TextCNN-Attention. The second layer is a multi-classification model of LightGBM based on the one-vs-rest strategy. Based on the experimental results, a threshold of 0.5 is selected. The model results were compared with those of other models such as XGBoost and Random Forest using the following evaluation indicators: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The prediction performance of the first-layer TextCNN is better than that of other comparison models. Its average specificity for non-infectious diseases is 97.57%, with an average negative predictive value of 82.63%, indicating a low risk of misdiagnosing non-infectious diseases as infectious (i.e., a low false positive rate). Its average positive predictive value for eight selected infectious diseases is 95.07%, demonstrating the model's ability to avoid misdiagnoses. The overall average accuracy of the model is 86.11%. The average prediction accuracy of the second-layer LightGBM model for emerging infectious diseases reaches 90.44%. Furthermore, the response time of a single online reasoning using the LightGBM model is approximately 27 ms, which makes it suitable for analyzing clinical records in real time. Using the Knox method, we found that all the infectious diseases were within 2000 m in our case, and a clustering feature of spatiotemporal interactions (P < 0.05) was observed as well. Performance testing and model comparison results indicated that the EIDDM is fast and accurate and can be used to monitor the onset/outbreak of emerging infectious diseases in real-world hospitals.",['(c) 2023.

This paper outlines modifications made to Omran's original model and stages of transition, and suggests that without a focus on aetiology and morbidity, these have been basically descriptive rather than explanatory, and potentially misleading because infections have been confirmed as causes of various chronic diseases. Common infections and related immune responses or inflammatory processes contribute to the multifactorial aetiology of morbid conditions that together make a substantial contribution to overall mortality, and infectious causation is suspected for many others because of strong evidence of association. Investigation into possible infectious causes of conditions frequently recorded as the underlying cause of death can be integrated into a framework for comparative research on patterns of disease and mortality in support of public health and prevention. A theory of epidemiological transition aimed at understanding changes in disease patterns can encompass the role in different conditions and chronic diseases of infections contracted over the life course, and their contribution to disability, morbidity and mortality relative to other causes and determinants.",,"['Mercer, A J']",['Mercer AJ'],"['Independent Researcher,38 Wren Walk, Eynesbury, St Neots, Cambridgeshire PE19 2GE,UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180320,England,Epidemiol Infect,Epidemiology and infection,8703737,IM,"['Communicable Diseases/*epidemiology/*mortality/transmission', '*Disease Transmission, Infectious', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological']",PMC9134371,['NOTNLM'],"['Aetiology', 'chronic disease', 'epidemiological transition', 'infectious disease', 'mortality']",2018/03/21 06:00,2019/01/04 06:00,['2018/03/21 06:00'],"['2018/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/03/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0950268818000572 [pii]', '00057 [pii]', '10.1017/S0950268818000572 [doi]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Infect. 2018 Apr;146(6):680-687. doi: 10.1017/S0950268818000572.

Levels of genetic variation in susceptibility associated with 40 human infectious diseases were assessed by a survey of studies on both pedigree-based quantitative variation, as well as studies on different classes of marker alleles. These estimates were correlated with pathogen traits, epidemiological characteristics, and effectiveness of the human immune response. The strongest predictors of levels of genetic variation in susceptibility were disease characteristics negatively associated with immune effectiveness. High levels of genetic variation were associated with diseases with long infectious periods and for which vaccine development attempts have been unsuccessful. These findings are consistent with predictions based on theoretical models incorporating fitness costs associated with the different types of resistance mechanisms.

Genomic sequencing has revealed the much-awaited blueprint of most pathogens. Screening blood for the nucleic acids of infectious agents has blunted the spread of pathogens by transfusion, the field of antiviral therapeutics has exploded and technologies for the development of novel and safer vaccines have become available.

Analysis of the Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON) database quantitatively illustrates that the globalization of human infectious agents depends significantly on the range of hosts used. Infectious agents specific to humans are broadly and uniformly distributed, whereas zoonotic infectious agents are far more localized in their geographical distribution. Moreover, these patterns vary depending on transmission mode and infectious agent taxonomy. This dichotomy is unlikely to persist if certain aspects of globalization (for example, exotic species introductions) continue unabated. This raises a serious concern for public health and leaves nations with the task of determining the infectious agents that have the greatest potential to establish within their borders.

This article outlines the changes in the mortality patterns that were observed in the country and in its states during the decade of the 1980s. We used data from the Ministry of Health Mortality Information System, classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision. Our analysis showed important changes in mortality patterns in Brazil. Mortality from infectious diseases decreased by 41% among men and by 44% among women. While these types of changes were especially noticeable in the states of the North and Northeast, these states still have the highest mortality rates in the country. The changes particularly affected the extreme limits of the age continuum, most especially children under 1 year of age. Within the group of infectious and parasitic diseases, we also assessed the mortality due to intestinal infectious diseases, tuberculosis, and septicemia. We found that in the 1980s there was a major decrease in the rates of mortality due to intestinal infectious diseases and to tuberculosis. However, there was an increase in the risk of death from septicemia during the decade. In conclusion, we find that the rate of mortality caused by infectious and parasitic diseases remains high in Brazil.

The greatest risk of invasive disease is in the young, the malnourished and HIV-infected individuals. In many regions in Africa these vulnerable groups and the wider general population are under constant immune pressure from a range of environmental factors, under-nutrition and multiple concurrent infections from birth through to adulthood. Intermittent microbial exposure during childhood is required for the generation of naturally acquired immunity capable of protection against a range of infectious diseases in adult life. However, in the context of a resource-poor setting, the heavy burden of malarial, diarrhoeal and respiratory infections in childhood may subvert or suppress immune responses rather than protect, resulting in sub-optimal immunity. This review will explore how poor maternal health, HIV exposure, socio-economic and seasonal factors conspire to weaken childhood immune defences to disease and discuss the hypothesis that recurrent infections may drive immune dysregulation, leading to relative immune senescence and premature immunological aging.",['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Bradley's agents included microscopic organisms, revealed by the studies of Robert Hooke and Antony van Leeuwenhoek. His theory derived from his experimental studies of plants and their diseases and from microscopic observation of animalcules in different naturally occurring and artificial environments. He concluded that there was a microscopic world of ""insects"" that lived and reproduced under the appropriate conditions, and that infectious diseases of plants were caused by such ""insects.""

Various pathogen detection techniques have been introduced; however, most techniques are time-consuming and lack multiple-target detection specificity. Although multiple-target detection techniques can distinguish emerging infectious pathogens from related pathogens, direct amplification methods have not been widely examined. Here, we present a novel arch-shaped multiple-target sensor capable of rapid pathogen identification using direct amplification in clinical samples. In this study, an arch-shaped amplification containing primer sequences was designed to rapidly amplify multiple targets. Further, the sensing platform allowed for sensitive and specific detection of human coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Zika virus, and Ebola virus down to several copies. This platform also simultaneously distinguished between Middle East respiratory syndrome and human coronavirus in clinical specimens within 20 min. This arch-shaped multiple-target sensing assay can provide rapid, sensitive, and accurate diagnoses of emerging infectious diseases in clinical applications.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this second part, the stress is placed on the reemergence of diphtheria and of serious streptococcal infections, on bartonelloses, Chlamydia infections, fungal infections, while malaria and cholera are still prevalent in several areas. The increasing resistance of too many pathogens to antimicrobial agents is a major source of concern, directly related to the challenge of nosocomial infections. An infectious cause has been demonstrated (or strongly suspected) for various diseases and the scope of infectiology keeps widening, while the threat of bioterrorism cannot be neglected. The causes of the emergence or reemergence of infectious diseases are multiple and diverse, often in direct relation with human activities (population migrations, changes in husbandry or farming practices, worldwide exchanges of goods and foods, inadequate uses of antibiotics) but also with climatic variations in several areas. The challenge represented by this unexpected comeback of infections to the forefront of human and animal pathology can only be met with a significant improvement of hygienic practices, cessation of certain dangerous behaviors and also, of course, with the development of novel antimicrobial molecules (acting on original targets) as well as of a whole series of new specific vaccines.",,"['Werner, G H']",['Werner GH'],"[""Membre Associe Libre de l'Academie nationale de Pharmacie.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,France,Ann Pharm Fr,Annales pharmaceutiques francaises,2985176R,IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bioterrorism', '*Communicable Disease Control', '*Communicable Diseases/drug therapy/microbiology/virology', 'Humans']",,,,2001/07/27 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['MDOI-APF-07-2001-59-4-0003-4509-101019-ART6 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Pharm Fr. 2001 Jul;59(4):246-77.,,,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],,,199,,,"Les defis mondiaux des maladies infectieuses ""nouvelles"" ou resurgentes en ce debut de XXIe siecle.

It is likely that an emerging infectious disease (EID) rarely occurs as the result of only one driver; rather, a network of sub-drivers (factors that can influence a driver) are likely to provide conditions that allow a pathogen to (re-)emerge and become established. Data on sub-drivers have therefore been used by modellers to identify hotspots where EIDs may next occur, or to estimate which sub-drivers have the greatest influence on the likelihood of their occurrence. To minimise error and bias when modelling how sub-drivers interact, and thus aid in predicting the likelihood of infectious disease emergence, researchers need good-quality data to describe these sub-drivers. This study assesses the quality of the available data on sub-drivers of West Nile virus against various criteria as a case study. The data were found to be of varying quality with regard to fulfilling the criteria. The characteristic with the lowest score was completeness, i.e. where sufficient data are available to fulfil all the requirements for the model. This is an important characteristic as an incomplete data set could lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn from modelling studies. Thus, the availability of good-quality data is essential to reduce uncertainty when estimating the likelihood of where EID outbreaks may occur and identifying the points on the risk pathway where preventive measures may be taken.",,"['Horigan, V', 'Kelly, L', 'Papa, A', 'Koopmans, M P G', 'Sikkema, R S', 'Koren, L G H', 'Snary, E L']","['Horigan V', 'Kelly L', 'Papa A', 'Koopmans MPG', 'Sikkema RS', 'Koren LGH', 'Snary EL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,France,Rev Sci Tech,Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),8712301,IM,"['Animals', '*Communicable Diseases, Emerging/prevention & control/veterinary', '*Communicable Diseases/epidemiology/veterinary', 'Disease Outbreaks/prevention & control']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Data quality', 'Drivers', 'Emerging infectious disease', 'Modellinge', 'Predicting disease outbreaks', 'Prevention', 'West Nile virus']",2023/05/26 13:09,2023/05/29 06:42,['2023/05/26 06:03'],"['2023/05/29 06:42 [medline]', '2023/05/26 13:09 [pubmed]', '2023/05/26 06:03 [entrez]']",['10.20506/rst.42.3352 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Sci Tech. 2023 May;42:90-102. doi: 10.20506/rst.42.3352.,,,,,,,,,Assessing the quality of data for drivers of disease emergence.,,,,,,,,

The course of disease, immediate and long-term consequences depend on the mode of entry. If the infection comes via oropharynx, airway, gastrointestinal tract or via skin, the immune system provides adequate immune response. This leads to typical symptoms, cyclical clinic progression and usually to the recovery with the formation of full sterile immunity. In case of parenteral way of infection, which includes perinatal way, there is no full mode of entry, the disease takes chronic course involving visceral organs because of different mechanisms of affinity and new tropic organ involving. For the full sanogenesis germ or its mediators should persist in the primary focus of infection. It is suggested, that HIV, HCV, hepatitis B virus, tetanus, rabies and other infectious diseases with inner organs involvement, as well as all slow infections, should be treated as infectious diseases with the parental way of infection, proceeding with affinity changings, which lead to the appearance of new tropic sites in visceral organs.

Significant progress has been achieved in the development of delivery systems for protective heterologous protein antigens and in veterinary vaccinology. A landmark of infectious diseases research is the chemical synthesis of genomes, a major new field of research referred to as ""synthetic biology"", that to date has resulted in the chemical synthesis of the poliovirus and of phage phiX174 genomes and their expression as infectious viruses. On the molecular level the evolution of pathogens and mechanisms of genome flexibility, which account for several pathogenic properties of infectious agents, have received increased attention.

Of these, 46/138 (33.3%) cetaceans were diagnosed with anthropogenic pathological categories (i.e. the cause of death was anthropogenic). These included fishing interaction (bycatch) (19 individuals), 'atypical' mass stranding events linked to naval exercises (13), ship collisions (8) and other anthropogenic-related pathology (6). 'Natural' (i.e. non-anthropogenic) causes of death accounted for another 82/138 (59.4%) cases, including infectious and non-infectious diseases (63), neonatal pathology (8), intra- and interspecific interactions (6) and mass strandings (5). The cause(s) of death could not be determined in 10/138 (7.3%) necropsied animals. The most common causes of death were ship collisions in 6/9 (66.6%) Physeteridae, 'atypical' mass stranding linked to naval exercises in 13/27 (48.1%) Ziphiidae, and 'natural' infectious and non-infectious diseases in 55/90 (61.1%) Delphinidae. Interaction with fishing activities was established as cause of death in 15/90 (16.7%) Delphinidae. These data show that a range of anthropogenic and natural single and mass mortality events occur in multiple cetacean species stranded in the Canary Islands.",,"['Arbelo, Manuel', 'Los Monteros, Antonio Espinosa de', 'Herraez, Pedro', 'Andrada, Marisa', 'Sierra, Eva', 'Rodriguez, Francisco', 'Jepson, Paul D', 'Fernandez, Antonio']","['Arbelo M', 'Los Monteros AE', 'Herraez P', 'Andrada M', 'Sierra E', 'Rodriguez F', 'Jepson PD', 'Fernandez A']","['Institute of Animal Health, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain. marbelo@dmor.ulpgc.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Dis Aquat Organ,Diseases of aquatic organisms,8807037,IM,"['Animals', '*Cetacea', 'Communicable Diseases/epidemiology/mortality/pathology/*veterinary', 'Human Activities', 'Ships', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Time Factors', 'Wounds and Injuries/epidemiology/mortality/*veterinary']",,,,2013/04/04 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3354/dao02558 [doi]'],ppublish,Dis Aquat Organ. 2013 Mar 26;103(2):87-99. doi: 10.3354/dao02558.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

II.

We highlight four ways in which population-genetic models provide benefits beyond those provided by most invasion analyses: (i) they can make predictions about the rate of pathogen evolution; (ii) they explicitly draw out the mechanistic way in which the epidemiological dynamics feed into evolutionary change, and thereby provide new insights into pathogen evolution; (iii) they can make predictions about the evolutionary consequences of non-equilibrium epidemiological dynamics; (iv) they can readily incorporate the effects of multiple host dynamics, and thereby account for phenomena such as immunological history and/or host co-evolution.",,"['Day, Troy', 'Gandon, Sylvain']","['Day T', 'Gandon S']","[""Department of Mathematics, Jeffery Hall, Queen's University, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada. tday@mast.queensu.ca""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Ecol Lett,Ecology letters,101121949,IM,"['Biological Evolution', 'Communicable Diseases/*epidemiology/*genetics/transmission', 'Genetics, Population', 'Humans', '*Models, Genetic']",,,,2007/09/12 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/09/12 09:00'],"['2007/09/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['ELE1091 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01091.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ecol Lett. 2007 Oct;10(10):876-88. doi: 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01091.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Descriptive statistical parameters and multivariate methods were used to analyze data. RESULTS: Diseases that have an enteric mode of transmission predominate in summer, independent of the type of agent (viral or bacterial) or presence of carriers. Diseases with a respiratory mode of transmission have two different patterns. Those without carriers (measles and whooping cough) predominate in spring and those with carriers (scarlet fever, diphtheria and meningitis) have a winter predominance.

Pathogen exposure is thought to arise through an increase in the number of interactions between humans and their natural environment, changes in demography and mobility, or through genetic variation in the infectious agents which may alter virulence or ability to infect new host species. The study of new diseases (which are often revealed by unusually severe symptoms or atypical epidemiological patterns) applies the most effort to the research of new pathogens. Here, using examples, we discuss alternative but non-exclusive mechanisms that may either reveal the presence of long-term circulating pathogens or explain changes in their nosologic properties in relation to their pattern of circulation and infection conditions.

Equally problematic is the struggle against salmonellosis associated with the mechanized mass production and distribution of foodstuffs as well as the forms of infectious hospitalism, especially hepatitis B, which are favoured by the technical advances in the medical field. Venereal diseases prove highly resistant because the human patterns of sexual behaviour are difficult to influence. Thus the infectious diseases caused by deficient hygiene have virtually disappeared in our country, while those diseases survive or occur which are capable of profiting from the sociological changes and the technical progress of civilisation.

Equine practitioners must be able to interpret the use, limitations, and results of molecular diagnostic techniques, as they are increasingly integrated into routine microbiology laboratory protocols. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the best-known and most successfully implemented diagnostic molecular technology to date. It can detect slow-growing, difficult-to-cultivate, or uncultivatable microorganisms and can be used in situations in which clinical microbiology diagnostic procedures are inadequate, time-consuming, difficult, expensive, or hazardous to laboratory staff. Inherent technical limitations of PCR are present, but they are reduced in laboratories that use standardized protocols, conduct rigid validation protocols, and adhere to appropriate quality-control procedures. Improvements in PCR, especially probe-based real-time PCR, have broadened its diagnostic capabilities in clinical infectious diseases to complement and even surpass traditional methods in some situations. Furthermore, real-time PCR is capable of quantitation, allowing discrimination of clinically relevant infections characterized by pathogen replication and high pathogen loads from chronic latent infections. Automation of all components of PCR is now possible, which will decrease the risk of generating false-positive results due to contamination.

This article reviews the most relevant viral, bacterial and protozoal diseases and their cutaneous manifestations. Many of the diseases discussed have overlapping presentations or may mimic more common noninfectious disease processes. The purpose of the article is to reinforce knowledge of common and uncommon infectious diseases, help practitioners identify possible infectious dermatoses, create a comprehensive and prioritized differential list, and provide guidance for the diagnosis of these diseases. A working knowledge of these clinical syndromes is important if what is thought to be a case of a common disease does not respond to conventional management. AUDIENCE: This review is aimed at veterinarians who treat cats and especially those with an interest in feline dermatology. Tables are included to allow the reader to formulate a concise list of differential diagnoses for clinically similar presentations. The diagnostic approach to a case of ulcerative facial dermatitis is reviewed in a Case Notes quiz. Evidence base: This article includes up-to-date information regarding dermatologic manifestations of less commonly encountered feline cutaneous infectious diseases.

The proposed systematic review will evaluate the current evidence regarding the effect of telemedicine infectious diseases consultation on a range of clinical outcomes, including mortality, hospital readmission, antimicrobial use, and cost. METHOD/DESIGN: Standard systematic review methodology will be used, with searches of Ovid MEDLINE 1946-, https://embase.com/ 1947-, Scopus 1823-, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and https://clinicaltrials.gov/ 1997-. There will be no restriction on language or year of publication. The primary outcome will be 30-day all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes will include readmission within 30 days after discharge from an initial hospitalization with an infection, patient compliance/adherence, patient satisfaction, cost or cost effectiveness, length of hospital stay, antimicrobial use, and antimicrobial stewardship. Bias will be assessed using standard Cochrane methodologies. Data will be grouped by outcome and narratively synthesized. Meta-analysis will be performed for outcomes with clinical or methodological homogeneity. The systematic review and meta-analysis will be registered through PROSPERO. Pre-planned subgroup analyses will be detailed. DISCUSSION: A number of studies have documented the feasibility of telemedicine for infectious diseases, but a synthesis of clinical outcomes data with telemedicine infectious diseases consultation has not been performed. This systematic review will analyze many clinical outcomes of telemedicine infectious diseases consultation. The findings of this study will add to established literature about feasibility of telemedicine consultation by synthesizing the evidence for clinical effectiveness.

An estimated 3 to 4 million animals are cared for or placed in homes each year, and most shelters promote public health and support responsible pet ownership. It is, nonetheless, inevitable that shelters are prime examples of anthropogenic biological instability: even well-run shelters often house transient, displaced, and mixed populations of animals. Many of these animals have received minimal to no prior health care, and some have a history of scavenging or predation to survive. Overcrowding and poor shelter conditions further magnify these inherent risks to create individual, intraspecies, and interspecies stress and provide an environment conducive to exposure to numerous potentially collaborative pathogens. All of these factors can contribute to the evolution and emergence of new pathogens or to alterations in virulence of endemic pathogens. While it is not possible to effectively anticipate the timing or the pathogen type in emergence events, their sites of origin are less enigmatic, and pathologists and diagnosticians who work with sheltered animal populations have recognized several such events in the past decade. This article first considers the contribution of the shelter environment to canine and feline disease. This is followed by summaries of recent research on the pathogenesis of common shelter pathogens, as well as research that has led to the discovery of novel or emerging diseases and the methods that are used for their diagnosis and discovery. For the infectious agents that commonly affect sheltered dogs and cats, including canine distemper virus, canine influenza virus, Streptococcus spp, parvoviruses, feline herpesvirus, feline caliciviruses, and feline infectious peritonitis virus, we present familiar as well as newly recognized lesions associated with infection. Preliminary studies on recently discovered viruses like canine circovirus, canine bocavirus, and feline norovirus indicate that these pathogens can cause or contribute to canine and feline disease.",,"['Pesavento, P A', 'Murphy, B G']","['Pesavento PA', 'Murphy BG']","['School of Veterinary Medicine, UC Davis, Vet Med: PMI, 4206 VM3A, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616, USA.

Infectious disease curricula should include training in HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases. There is a need for a core curriculum in infection control. Infection control should have a basis in both medical microbiology and infectious diseases, and should become a specialty dealing with healthcare hygiene in hospitals, in outpatient clinics and also in institutions for the elderly. In the UK, a specialty training in infection is offered and includes internal medicine, clinical infectious diseases and medical microbiology for a total of 9 years. The UEMS should be contacted about the creation of a single specialty of infection, allowing for various degrees of sub-specialisation in infectious diseases or medical microbiology. It is unlikely that a European board examination validating the training of specialists will become a reality soon. Meanwhile, national systems should be created, documenting the content of the training and evaluating the quality of the training institutions. A medical specialist has a constant need for further education. This is generally a national matter, with requirements varying throughout Europe. It should be possible to accumulate continuing medical education/continuing professional development merits on a European level as well as on a national one.

These industrial agricultural operations have the potential of housing thousands of animals in a relatively small area. Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs) event can be considered as a shift in the pathogen-host-environment interplay characteristics described by Engering et al. (2013). These changes in the host-environment and the disease ecology are key to creating novel transmission patterns and selection of novel pathogens with a modification of genetic traits. With the development of CAFOs throughout the world, the need for training of animal caretakers to observe, identify, treat, vaccinate and cull if necessary is important to safeguard public health. The best defense against another pandemic of Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs) is the constant monitoring of the livestock and handlers of CAFOs and the live animal markets.

Reports of infectious disease outbreaks among competitive athletes and recent publicity regarding infectious disease concerns in sports underscore the need to better characterize the occurrence of these problems. DATA SOURCES: To identify reports of infectious diseases in sports, we performed a comprehensive search of the medical literature (MEDLINE) and newspaper databases in two on-line services (NEXIS and DIALOG PAPERS). STUDY SELECTION: Articles selected from the literature review included those describing cases or outbreaks of disease in which exposure to an infectious agent was likely to have occurred during training for competitive sports or during actual competition. Articles from the newspaper review included reports of outbreaks, exposures, or preventive measures that directly or indirectly involved teams or spectators. DATA SYNTHESIS: The literature review identified 38 reports of infectious disease outbreaks or other instances of transmission through person-to-person (24 reports), common-source (nine reports), or airborne (five reports) routes; the newspaper search identified 28 reports. Infectious agents included predominantly viruses but also a variety of fungi and gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that strategies to prevent transmission of infectious diseases in sports must recognize risks at three levels: the individual athlete, the team, and spectators or others who may become exposed to infectious diseases as a result of sports-related activities. Team physicians and others who are responsible for the health of athletes should be especially familiar with the features of infectious diseases that occur in sports and measures for the prevention of these problems.",,"['Goodman, R A', 'Thacker, S B', 'Solomon, S L', 'Osterholm, M T', 'Hughes, J M']","['Goodman RA', 'Thacker SB', 'Solomon SL', 'Osterholm MT', 'Hughes JM']","['Epidemiology Program Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga 30333.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,IM,"['Communicable Disease Control', 'Communicable Diseases/*epidemiology/microbiology/transmission', 'Data Collection', '*Disease Outbreaks/prevention & control/statistics & numerical data', 'HIV Infections/transmission', 'Humans', 'Information Systems', 'MEDLINE', 'Newspapers as Topic', '*Sports/statistics & numerical data', 'United States']",,,,1994/03/16 00:00,1994/03/16 00:01,['1994/03/16 00:00'],"['1994/03/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/16 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,JAMA. 1994 Mar 16;271(11):862-7.,,,,,['JAMA. 1994 Aug 10;272(6):436.

However, as the practice of pathology has become subspecialized, there is not enough infectious disease specimen volume to have a pathologist dedicated full time to this crosscutting subspecialty. So, what are the myths and realities of a practicing infectious disease pathologist in the hospital setting? Infectious disease clinicians tend to consult pathologists when there are questions regarding terminology used in pathology reports; when there is the need to perform additional studies on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues; and when there is an interest in seeing biopsies or resections obtained from patients and in obtaining photographs for presentations. Pathologists consult infectious disease pathologists when there is a need to review diverse inflammatory reactions; for identification of fungi, parasites, or unknown structures; to define the need to use special stains and other techniques in order to identify organisms in tissues that have been formalin fixed; and to help with terminology to be used in reports. This review explores in more detail why and how these consultations occur.","['(c) The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the', 'Infectious Diseases Society of America.

The importance of strengthening global public health surveillance to provide early warning has been the primary recommendation of expert groups for at least the past 2 decades. However, despite improvements in the past decade, public health surveillance capabilities remain limited and fragmented, with uneven global coverage. Recent initiatives provide hope of addressing this issue, and new technological and conceptual advances could, for the first time, place capability for global surveillance within reach. Such advances include the revised International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) and the use of new data sources and methods to improve global coverage, sensitivity, and timeliness, which show promise for providing capabilities to extend and complement the existing infrastructure. One example is syndromic surveillance, using nontraditional and often automated data sources. Over the past 20 years, other initiatives, including ProMED-mail, GPHIN, and HealthMap, have demonstrated new mechanisms for acquiring surveillance data. In 2009 the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) began the Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) program, which includes the PREDICT project, to build global capacity for surveillance of novel infections that have pandemic potential (originating in wildlife and at the animal-human interface) and to develop a framework for risk assessment. Improved understanding of factors driving infectious disease emergence and new technological capabilities in modeling, diagnostics and pathogen identification, and communications, such as using the increasing global coverage of cellphones for public health surveillance, can further enhance global surveillance.",,"['Morse, Stephen S']",['Morse SS'],"['USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats-PREDICT Program, Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY 10032, USA. ssm20@columbia.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Biosecur Bioterror,"Biosecurity and bioterrorism : biodefense strategy, practice, and science",101156085,IM,"['Communicable Disease Control/*methods', 'Communicable Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Communicable Diseases, Emerging/diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Disease Notification', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Pandemics', 'Population Surveillance/*methods', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,2012/03/30 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2012/03/30 06:00'],"['2012/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/bsp.2011.0088 [doi]'],ppublish,Biosecur Bioterror. 2012 Mar;10(1):6-16. doi: 10.1089/bsp.2011.0088.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rise in antimicrobial-resistant organisms, incurable chronic infections, and an increasing demand for rapid accurate diagnostics have prompted researchers to experiment with new approaches. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) is a naturally occurring adaptive immune system in bacteria that has been developed as a tool for performing genomic alterations in any genome of interest, including humans and microbes. Accordingly, several studies have been conducted to investigate how the technology can be utilized in infectious diseases to improve diagnostics, disrupt antimicrobial resistance, and cure chronic infections. This review provides an overview of the CRISPR-Cas system and how it has been applied in studies on infectious diseases. The review also investigates the current challenges of the technology and the improvements that are needed for the platform to be adopted for clinical use in patients.","['(c) The Author(s) 2022.

Individuals with lower socio-economic status suffer disproportionally from adverse health outcomes. While this is widely accepted for chronic diseases, a literature review covering the years 1999-2010 reveals that infectious diseases are also distributed unevenly throughout society, with vulnerable groups bearing a disproportionate burden. This burden is not restricted to a few 'signature infections of social determinants' such as tuberculosis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, but also a wide array of other infectious diseases. Tremendous advances in public health over the last century have reduced the absolute magnitude of inequalities but relative differences remain. In order to explore the underlying reasons for such persistent inequalities in Europe, I examined interventions targeting social determinants of infectious diseases: interventions on social determinants tend to focus on chronic diseases rather than infectious diseases, and interventions for these mainly focus on HIV/AIDS or other sexually transmitted infections. Thus, there seems to be a need to intervene on inequalities in infectious diseases but ideally with a comprehensive public health approach. Three intervention strategies are discussed: population-at-risk, population, and vulnerable population approaches.

As the global burden of antimicrobial resistance continues to rise, the judicious use of antimicrobials is of utmost importance. Syndromic panels are now being recognized in some clinical practice guidelines as a 'game-changer' in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. These syndromic panels, if implemented thoughtfully and interpreted carefully, have the potential to improve patient outcomes through improved clinical decision making, optimized laboratory workflow, and enhanced antimicrobial stewardship. This paper reviews the potential benefits of and considerations regarding various infectious diseases syndromic panels, and highlights how to maximize impact through collaboration between clinical microbiology laboratory and antimicrobial stewardship programmes.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

There is a growing need for resources that effectively integrate, analyze, deliver and visualize these data, both to improve our understanding of infectious diseases and to facilitate the development of strategies for disease control and prevention. RESULTS: We have developed Disease View, an online host-pathogen resource that enables infectious disease-centric access, analysis and visualization of host-pathogen interactions. In this resource, we associate infectious diseases with corresponding pathogens, provide information on pathogens, pathogen virulence genes and the genetic and chemical evidences for the human genes that are associated with the diseases. We also deliver the relationships between pathogens, genes and diseases in an interactive graph and provide the geolocation reports of associated diseases around the globe in real time. Unlike many other resources, we have applied an iterative, user-centered design process to the entire resource development, including data acquisition, analysis and visualization.

However the recent explosion of genetic data has revealed the rapid rate of evolution that many populations of infectious agents undergo and has underscored the need to consider both evolutionary and ecological processes on the same time scale. Mathematical epidemiology has applied dynamical models to study infectious epidemics, but these models have tended not to exploit--or take into account--evolutionary changes and their effect on the ecological processes and population dynamics of the infectious agent. On the other hand, statistical phylogenetics has increasingly been applied to the study of infectious agents. This approach is based on phylogenetics, molecular clocks, genealogy-based population genetics and phylogeography. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo and related computational tools have been the primary source of advances in these statistical phylogenetic approaches. Recently the first tentative steps have been taken to reconcile these two theoretical approaches. We survey the Bayesian phylogenetic approach to epidemic modeling of infection diseases and describe the contrasts it provides to mathematical epidemiology as well as emphasize the significance of the future unification of these two fields.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Modeling studies predict that changes in climate that accompany global warming will alter the transmission risk of many vector-borne infectious diseases in different parts of the world. Global warming will also raise sea levels, which will lead to an increase in saline and brackish water bodies in coastal areas. The potential impact of rising sea levels, as opposed to climate change, on the prevalence of vector-borne infectious diseases has hitherto been unrecognised. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Mosquito species possessing salinity-tolerant larvae and pupae, and capable of transmitting arboviruses and parasites are found in many parts of the world. An expansion of brackish and saline water bodies in coastal areas, associated with rising sea levels, can increase densities of salinity-tolerant vector mosquitoes and lead to the adaptation of freshwater vectors to breed in brackish and saline waters. The breeding of non-mosquito vectors may also be influenced by salinity changes in coastal habitats. Higher vector densities can increase transmission of vector-borne infectious diseases in coastal localities, which can then spread to other areas. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: The demonstration of increases in vector populations and disease prevalence that is related to an expansion of brackish/saline water bodies in coastal areas will provide the necessary supportive evidence. However the implementation of specific vector and disease control measures to counter the threat will confound the expected findings. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Rising sea levels can act synergistically with climate change and then interact in a complex manner with other environmental and socio-economic factors to generate a greater potential for the transmission of vector-borne infectious diseases. The resulting health impacts are likely to be particularly significant in resource-poor countries in the tropics and semi-tropics. Some measures to meet this threat are outlined.",,"['Ramasamy, Ranjan', 'Surendran, Sinnathamby N']","['Ramasamy R', 'Surendran SN']","['PAPSRB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Gadong, Brunei Darussalam. ranjan.ramasamy@ubd.edu.bn']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110118,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,IM,"['Animals', 'Climate Change', 'Communicable Diseases/epidemiology/parasitology/*transmission/virology', '*Ecosystem', 'Fresh Water/parasitology', 'Humans', 'Insect Vectors/parasitology/*physiology/virology', '*Salt Tolerance', 'Seawater/parasitology']",PMC3035583,,,2011/01/19 06:00,2011/05/04 06:00,['2011/01/19 06:00'],"['2010/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2334-11-18 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2334-11-18 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2011 Jan 18;11:18. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-11-18.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, a rapid and cost-effective pathogen screening method with broad coverage is required for prevention and control of infectious diseases. The availability of a large number of microbial genome sequences generated by conventional Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing has enabled the development of a high-throughput high-density microarray platform for rapid large-scale screening of vertebrate pathogens. METHODS: An easy operating pathogen microarray (EOPM) was designed to detect almost all known pathogens and related species based on their genomic sequences. For effective identification of pathogens from EOPM data, a statistical enrichment algorithm has been proposed, and further implemented in a user-friendly web-based interface. RESULTS: Using multiple probes designed to specifically detect a microbial genus or species, EOPM can correctly identify known pathogens at the species or genus level in blinded testing. Despite a lower sensitivity than PCR, EOPM is sufficiently sensitive to detect the predominant pathogens causing clinical symptoms. During application in two recent clinical infectious disease outbreaks in China, EOPM successfully identified the responsible pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: EOPM is an effective surveillance platform for infectious diseases, and can play an important role in infectious disease control.",,"['Huang, Weiwei', 'Yang, Yinhui', 'Zhang, Xinlei', 'Zhao, Changan', 'Yin, Aihua', 'Zhang, Xiaozhuang', 'He, Zhengxin', 'Jiang, Yongqiang', 'Zhang, Liang']","['Huang W', 'Yang Y', 'Zhang X', 'Zhao C', 'Yin A', 'Zhang X', 'He Z', 'Jiang Y', 'Zhang L']","['BioChain (Beijing) Science & Technology Inc,, No,7A, Yongchang North Rd, Business Development Area, Beijing 100176, China. jiangyq710327@sina.com.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130920,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,IM,"['Animals', 'Bacteria/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'China', 'Communicable Diseases/*diagnosis/microbiology/parasitology/virology', 'Fungi/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Microarray Analysis/instrumentation/*methods', 'Parasites/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Vertebrates', 'Viruses/genetics/*isolation & purification']",PMC3848773,,,2013/09/24 06:00,2014/06/24 06:00,['2013/09/24 06:00'],"['2012/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2334-13-437 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2334-13-437 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2013 Sep 20;13:437. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-13-437.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this note, we use simple models to show that in some circumstances, predation can actually increase the equilibrial prevalence of infection in a host, where prevalence is defined as the fraction of host population that is infected. Our results show that there is no complete generalization possible about how shifts in predation pressure translate into shifts in infection levels, without some understanding of host population regulation and the role of acquired immunity. Our results further highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics of nonregulatory pathogens in reservoir host populations and the understudied effects of demographic costs incurred by individuals that survive infection and develop acquired immunity.",,"['Holt, Robert D', 'Roy, Manojit']","['Holt RD', 'Roy M']","['Department of Zoology, University of Florida, P.O.

Much effort has been made to search for external mechanisms. Multiple strains of an infectious agent were usually observed and coinfections were frequent; further, empirical evidence indicates the simultaneous transmission of coinfections. To explore intrinsic mechanisms for epidemic cycling, in this study we consider a multistrain Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible epidemic model by including coinfections and simultaneous transmission. We show that coinfections and their simultaneous transmission widen the parameter range for coexistence and coinfections become popular when strains enhance each other and the immunity wanes quickly. However, the total prevalence is nearly independent of these characteristics and approximated by that of one-strain model. With sufficient simultaneous transmission and antigenic diversity, cyclical epidemics can be generated even when strains interfere with each other by reducing infectivity. This indicates that strain interactions within coinfections and cross-immunity during subsequent infection provide a possible intrinsic mechanism for epidemic cycling.",,"['Zhang, Xu-Sheng', 'Cao, Ke-Fei']","['Zhang XS', 'Cao KF']","['Department of Statistics, Modelling and Economics, Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, Public Health England, 61 Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5EQ, UK ; Medical Research Council Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, UK.', 'Centre for Nonlinear Complex Systems, Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan 650091, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140622,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,"['Antigenic Variation/immunology', 'Coinfection/*epidemiology', 'Communicable Diseases/*epidemiology/pathology/transmission', 'Humans', 'Models, Immunological', '*Models, Theoretical']",PMC4090573,,,2014/07/22 06:00,2015/03/13 06:00,['2014/07/22 06:00'],"['2014/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/375862 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2014;2014:375862. doi: 10.1155/2014/375862.

METHODS: A Pubmed, MEDLINE (Ovid), EBSCO Host (Global Health) and Google Scholar search was performed for both peer, non-peer reviewed articles and reports relevant to migrant health in Singapore, published between 1 January 1989 and 1 September 2016. Additional studies were identified from citations within searched articles. We also reviewed published data and policy documents from the Ministries of Health and Manpower, Singapore. RESULTS: A significant proportion of malaria, enteric fevers, hepatitis A and E and tuberculosis diagnosed in Singapore involve migrant workers. From the 1990-2000 through 2009-11, while malaria and hepatitis A cases have decreased and remain sporadic, enteric fevers and tuberculosis cases have increased, possibly due to greater influx of migrant workers. Hepatitis E numbers remain low but migrant workers account for half of diagnosed cases. In an interplay of immune naivete, work and living conditions, migrants in the construction industry are at higher risk of arboviral infections such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya. Infections such as chikungunya were likely introduced into Singapore by travellers including migrant workers from the Indian subcontinent but autochthonous transmission continued due to the presence of competent mosquito vectors. There is less data regarding sexual health, networks and infections amongst migrant workers, an area which merits further attention. CONCLUSIONS: Migrant workers appear to be at higher risk than Singaporeans for specific infectious diseases, probably due to a complex interplay of several factors, including higher disease prevalence in their countries of origin, socio-economic factors, their living conditions in Singapore and financial, language and cultural barriers to healthcare access. Receiving countries need improved surveillance, expansion of preventive measures and decreased barriers to healthcare access for migrant workers.","['(c) International Society of Travel Medicine, 2017.

The aetiology of these diseases is often unclear. The application of basic microbiological techniques in the Primary Care clinic could improve the diagnosis and patient management. The purpose of this study is to introduce basic techniques and rapid diagnostics in the management of patients attending a Primary Care clinic. METHODS: The analysis of patient samples by microbiological stains or rapid tests. RESULTS: In the study of 249 samples analysed on patients in the clinic, an aetiological diagnosis of the infection was made in 23% of the cases. A microbiology result that helped in the treatment was obtained in 72% of the patients. CONCLUSION: The application of basic microbiological techniques may improve diagnosis and therefore the management of patients visiting the Primary Care clinic. The characteristics of the population served (mostly immigrant, low socio-economic level, difficulty in monitoring patients) suggest that this project could be very useful in that kind of population. It would require larger studies to assess the application on a larger scale and cost-effectiveness of these measures",,"['Regata Cuesta, C']",['Regata Cuesta C'],,['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Spain,Semergen,Semergen,9610769,IM,"['Communicable Diseases/*diagnosis/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Emigrants and Immigrants', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microbiological Techniques/*methods', 'Primary Health Care/*methods', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,2012/03/01 00:00,2012/03/01 00:01,['2014/06/05 06:00'],"['2014/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Semergen. 2012 Mar;38(2):72-8.,,,,,,,,,Estudio de las enfermedades infecciosas en un cupo de atencion primaria de mayoria inmigrante: aplicacion de tecnicas microbiologicas en la consulta de primaria.,,,,,,,,

GeoSentinel, an epidemiological surveillance system for reporting imported infectious diseases, has only two participating facilities in Japan. Although the number of infectious diseases is reported by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, there is no detailed clinical information about these cases. Therefore, we established J-RIDA (Japan Registry for Infectious Diseases from Abroad) to clarify the status of imported infectious diseases in Japan and provide detailed information. METHODS: J-RIDA was started as a registry of imported infectious diseases. Case registration began in October 2017. Between October 2017 and September 2019, 15 medical institutions participated in this clinical study. The registry collected information about the patient's age, sex, nationality, chief complaint, consultation date, date of onset, whether visit was made to a travel clinic before travel, blood test results (if samples were collected), travel history, and final diagnosis. RESULTS: Of the 3046 cases included in this study, 46.7% to Southeast Asia, 13.0% to Africa, 13.7% to East Asia, 11.5% to South Asia, 7.5% to Europe, 3.8% to Central and South America, 4.6% to North America, 3.9% to Oceania, and 2.8% to Central and west Asia. More than 85% of chief complaints were fever and general symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory symptoms, or dermatologic problems. The most common diseases were travelers' diarrhea, animal bite, upper respiratory infection, influenza, and dengue fever. CONCLUSIONS: We summarized two-year cases registered in Japan's imported infectious disease registry. These results will significantly contribute to the epidemiology in Japan.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association', 'for Infectious Diseases.

A number of these regions are associated with response to infection and immunity, with a suggestion that derived Neanderthal alleles found in modern Europeans and East Asians may be associated with autoimmunity. As such Neanderthal genomes are an independent line of evidence of which infectious diseases Neanderthals were genetically adapted to. Sympathetically, human genome adaptive introgression is an independent line of evidence of which infectious diseases were important for AMH coming in to Eurasia and interacting with Neanderthals. The Neanderthals and Denisovans present interesting cases of hominin hunter-gatherers adapted to a Eurasian rather than African infectious disease package. Independent sources of DNA-based evidence allow a re-evaluation of the first epidemiologic transition and how infectious disease affected Pleistocene hominins. By combining skeletal, archaeological and genetic evidence from modern humans and extinct Eurasian hominins, we question whether the first epidemiologic transition in Eurasia featured a new package of infectious diseases or a change in the impact of existing pathogens. Coupled with pathogen genomics, this approach supports the view that many infectious diseases are pre-Neolithic, and the list continues to expand. The transfer of pathogens between hominin populations, including the expansion of pathogens from Africa, may also have played a role in the extinction of the Neanderthals and offers an important mechanism to understand hominin-hominin interactions well back beyond the current limits for aDNA extraction from fossils alone.

Further, our analysis shows that transport-related infection intensifies the disease spread if infectious diseases break out to cause an endemic situation in each region, in the sense that both the absolute and relative size of patients increase.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 158 patients with migraine and 79 patients with tension headache were examined. Diagnostics of chronic and recurrent infectious diseases were carried out by the appropriate specialists according to the current standards. Immunologic studies included evaluation of cellular, humoral, innate immunity, cytokine status parameters. RESULTS: Spread of chronic and recurrent infectious diseases, that were considered as clinical manifestations of secondary immunodeficiency, in patients with primary headache exceeded the spread in the population of the region. In the patients with a combination of cephalgia and infectious pathology a tendency of leucopenia, lymphocyte subpopulation composition disorders, neutrophil functional activity, IgG level decrease, cytokine system imbalance were characteristic. In chronic primary headache course rate of occurrence of infectious diseases and intensity of immune status disorders were higher than in episodic course of these cephalgias.

These views are also inherently unable to account for the ability of some microbes to cause disease in certain, but not other hosts, because they are grounded in singular, either microbe-or host-centric views. The damage-response framework is an integrated theory of microbial pathogenesis that puts forth the view that microbial pathogenesis reflects the outcome of an interaction between a host and a microbe, with each entity contributing to the nature of the outcome, which in turn depends on the amount of host damage that results from the host-microbe interaction. This view is able to accommodate new information and explain why infection with the same microbe can have different outcomes in different hosts.

These diseases may lead within a short period of time to great personal and property losses, especially in regions where sanitation is poor. Thus, rapid diagnoses are vital for the prevention and therapeutic intervention of human infectious diseases. Several conventional methods are often used to diagnose infectious diseases, e.g. methods based on cultures or morphology, or biochemical tests based on metabonomics. Although traditional methods are considered gold standards and are used most frequently, they are laborious, time consuming, and tedious and cannot meet the demand for rapid diagnoses. Disease diagnosis using capillary electrophoresis methods has the advantages of high efficiency, high throughput, and high speed, and coupled with the different nucleic acid detection strategies overcomes the drawbacks of traditional identification methods, precluding many types of false positive and negative results. Therefore, this review focuses on the application of capillary electrophoresis based on nucleic detection to the diagnosis of human infectious diseases, and offers an introduction to the limitations, advantages, and future developments of this approach.",,"['Lian, Dong-Sheng', 'Zhao, Shu-Jin']","['Lian DS', 'Zhao SJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,IM,"['Bacteria/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Communicable Diseases/*diagnosis/*microbiology', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Humans']",,,,2015/09/10 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2015/09/10 06:00'],"['2015/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['/j/cclm.ahead-of-print/cclm-2015-0096/cclm-2015-0096.xml [pii]', '10.1515/cclm-2015-0096 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2016 May;54(5):707-38. doi: 10.1515/cclm-2015-0096.,,,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infectious diseases are the second most common cause of death in HCT recipients, surpassed only by progression of underlying disease. Many infectious diseases are difficult to diagnose and treat, and may only be first identified by autopsy. However, autopsy rates are decreasing despite their value. The clinical and autopsy records of adult HCT recipients at our center who underwent autopsy between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2017 were reviewed. Discrepancies between premortem clinical diagnoses and postmortem autopsy diagnoses were evaluated. Of 185 patients who underwent autopsy, 35 patients (18.8%) had a total of 41 missed infections. Five patients (2.7%) had >1 missed infection. Of the 41 missed infections, 18 (43.9%) were viral, 16 (39.0%) were fungal, 5 (12.2%) were bacterial, and 2 (4.9%) were parasitic. According to the Goldman criteria, 31 discrepancies (75.6%) were class I, 5 (12.2%) were class II, 1 (2.4%) was class III, and 4 (9.8%) were class IV. Autopsies of HCT recipients frequently identify clinically significant infectious diseases that were not suspected premortem. Had these infections been suspected, a change in management might have improved patient survival in many of these cases.

Pathogens continue to evolve, emerge and re-emerge and infectious diseases that were once common become less so or their global distribution changes. A question remains as to whether scientific endeavours can adapt. Here, we identified papers on infectious diseases published in the four highest ranking, health-related journals over the 118 years from 1900. Focussing on outbreak-related and burden of disease-related metrics over the two time periods, 1990 to 2017 and 1900 to 2017, our analyses suggest that there is little underrepresentation of important infectious diseases among top ranked journals.

The recent noticeable decrease in the morbidity of measles in the Russian Federation suggests that the disease may be the third infection, after smallpox and poliomyelitis, to be eradicated in Russia. The high incidence of tick-borne viral encephalitis is a result of not only the insufficient coverage of the population with vaccination, but also the reduction in the scope of antitick treatments and the use of ineffective and environmentally unstable agents for barrier ground treatments.

The requisite measures to optimize the prevention of infectious diseases are to improve the methodology of epidemiological surveillance of infectious and parasitic diseases, to perfect an epidemiological surveillance system during the epidemic spread of infections, to assess an epidemiological risk, to make a microbiological monitoring of the major pathogens of infectious diseases, and to elaborate and perfect the strategy and tactics of nonspecific prevention of extremely dangerous infectious diseases.",,"['Onishchenko, G G']",['Onishchenko GG'],,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Gig Sanit,Gigiena i sanitariia,0412700,IM,"['Communicable Diseases/epidemiology/*immunology/transmission', 'Health Services Administration', 'Humans', 'Population Surveillance/*methods', 'Russia', 'Vaccination/*trends']",,,,2008/03/28 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gig Sanit. 2008 Jan-Feb;(1):4-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to other human diseases such as cancer, studies on VOC analysis in cases of infectious diseases are limited. Here, we have described results of studies which have used some of the appropriate technologies to evaluate VOC biomarkers and biomarker profiles associated with infections. The publications reviewed include important infections of the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and nasal cavity. The results highlight the use of VOC biomarker profiles resulting from certain infectious diseases in discriminating between infected and healthy subjects. Infection-related VOC profiles measured in exhaled breath as well as from headspaces of feces or urine samples are a source of information with respect to disease detection. The volatiles emitted in clinical matrices may on the one hand represent metabolites of the infecting pathogen or on the other hand reflect pathogen-induced host responses or, indeed, a combination of both. Because exhaled-breath samples are easy to collect and online instruments are commercially available, VOC analysis in exhaled breath appears to be a promising tool for noninvasive detection and monitoring of infectious diseases.",,"['Sethi, Shneh', 'Nanda, Ranjan', 'Chakraborty, Trinad']","['Sethi S', 'Nanda R', 'Chakraborty T']","['Institute for Medical Microbiology, German Center for Infection Research DZIF, Justus-Liebig University Giessen, Giessen, Germany. shneh.sethi@mikrobio.med.uni-giessen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Microbiol Rev,Clinical microbiology reviews,8807282,IM,"['*Breath Tests', 'Communicable Diseases/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Volatile Organic Compounds/*analysis']",PMC3719490,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['26/3/462 [pii]', '00020-13 [pii]', '10.1128/CMR.00020-13 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Microbiol Rev. 2013 Jul;26(3):462-75. doi: 10.1128/CMR.00020-13.,,,['0 (Volatile Organic Compounds)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NET-Heart Project: Rationale and Design.,60,10.5334/gh.867 [doi] 60,"INTRODUCTION: Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of infections that are prevalent in many of the tropical and sub-tropical developing countries where poverty is rampant. NTDs have remained largely unnoticed in the global health agenda. There is a substantial gap between the burden of disease for NTDs in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and research devoted to the affected populations. We created a Latin-American initiative with emerging leaders (EL) from the Interamerican Society of Cardiology (IASC) with the objective to perform multiple systematic reviews of NTDs and other infectious diseases affecting the heart: The NET-Heart Project. OBJECTIVE: To describe the rationale and design considerations of the NET-Heart project. METHODS: The NET-Heart Project is a collaborative work of the IASC EL program. The main objective of the NET-Heart project is to systematically evaluate the available evidence of NTDs and other infectious diseases and their cardiovascular involvement. As a secondary objective, this initiative aims to offer recommendations and potential diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms that can aid the management of cardiovascular complications of these infectious diseases. After an expert discussion 17 initial infectious diseases were selected, for each disease we created one working group. The project was structured in different phases: Systematic review, brainstorming workshops, analysis and results, manuscript writing and recommendations and evaluation of clinical implications. CONCLUSION: The NET-Heart project is an innovative collaborative initiative created to assess burden and impact of NTDs and other infectious diseases in CVD. NTDs can no longer be ignored and must be prioritised on the health and research agenda. This project aims to review in depth the evidence regarding cardiac compromise of these serious conditions and to propose strategies to overcome barriers for efficient diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular complications.",['Copyright: (c) 2020 The Author(s).'],"['Burgos, Lucrecia M', 'Farina, Juan', 'Liendro, Macarena Cousirat', 'Saldarriaga, Clara', 'Liprandi, Alvaro Sosa', 'Wyss, Fernando', 'Mendoza, Ivan', 'Baranchuk, Adrian']","['Burgos LM', 'Farina J', 'Liendro MC', 'Saldarriaga C', 'Liprandi AS', 'Wyss F', 'Mendoza I', 'Baranchuk A']","['Department of Heart Failure, Pulmonary Hypertension and Heart Transplant, Instituto Cardiovascular de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, AR.', 'Division of Cardiology, Clinica Olivos, Buenos Aires, AR.', 'Division of Cardiology, Hospital General de Agudos Carlos G.

The germ theory of diseases then gradually overcame the belief that diseases were intrinsic. However, around the turn of the twentieth century, asymptomatic infection was discovered to be much more common than clinical disease. Paradoxically, this observation barely challenged the newly developed notion that infectious diseases were fundamentally extrinsic. Moreover, interindividual variability in the course of infection was typically explained by the emerging immunological (or somatic) theory of infectious diseases, best illustrated by the impact of vaccination. This powerful explanation is, however, best applicable to reactivation and secondary infections, particularly in adults; it can less easily account for interindividual variability in the course of primary infection during childhood. Population and clinical geneticists soon proposed a complementary hypothesis, a germline genetic theory of infectious diseases. Over the past century, this idea has gained some support, particularly among clinicians and geneticists, but has also encountered resistance, particularly among microbiologists and immunologists. We present here the genetic theory of infectious diseases and briefly discuss its history and the challenges encountered during its emergence in the context of the apparently competing but actually complementary microbiological and immunological theories. We also illustrate its recent achievements by highlighting inborn errors of immunity underlying eight life-threatening infectious diseases of children and young adults. Finally, we consider the far-reaching biological and clinical implications of the ongoing human genetic dissection of severe infectious diseases.",,"['Casanova, Jean-Laurent', 'Abel, Laurent']","['Casanova JL', 'Abel L']","['St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases, Rockefeller Branch, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065; email: casanova@rockefeller.edu.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130529,United States,Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet,Annual review of genomics and human genetics,100911346,IM,"['Allergy and Immunology/history', 'Animals', 'Communicable Diseases/*genetics/*immunology/microbiology', 'Genetics/history', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans']",PMC4980761,,,2013/06/04 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1146/annurev-genom-091212-153448 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. 2013;14:215-43. doi: 10.1146/annurev-genom-091212-153448.

The burden-of-disease metric used was the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY), composed of years of life lost due to premature death (YLL) and due to disability (YLD). To better represent infectious diseases, a pathogen-based approach was used linking incident cases to sequelae through outcome trees. Health outcomes were included if an evidence-based causal relationship between infection and outcome was established. Life expectancy and disability weights were taken from the Global Burden of Disease Study and alternative studies. Disease progression parameters were based on literature. Country-specific incidence was based on surveillance data corrected for underestimation. Non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. were used for illustration. Using the incidence- and pathogen-based DALY approach the total burden for Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. was estimated at 730 DALYs and at 1,780 DALYs per year in the Netherlands (average of 2005-2007). Sequelae accounted for 56% and 82% of the total burden of Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp., respectively. The incidence- and pathogen-based DALY methodology allows in the case of infectious diseases a more comprehensive calculation of the disease burden as subsequent sequelae are fully taken into account. Not considering subsequent sequelae would strongly underestimate the burden of infectious diseases. Estimates can be used to support prioritisation and comparison of infectious diseases and other health conditions, both within a country and between countries.",,"['Mangen, Marie-Josee J', 'Plass, Dietrich', 'Havelaar, Arie H', 'Gibbons, Cheryl L', 'Cassini, Alessandro', 'Muhlberger, Nikolai', 'van Lier, Alies', 'Haagsma, Juanita A', 'Brooke, R John', 'Lai, Taavi', 'de Waure, Chiara', 'Kramarz, Piotr', 'Kretzschmar, Mirjam E E']","['Mangen MJ', 'Plass D', 'Havelaar AH', 'Gibbons CL', 'Cassini A', 'Muhlberger N', 'van Lier A', 'Haagsma JA', 'Brooke RJ', 'Lai T', 'de Waure C', 'Kramarz P', 'Kretzschmar ME']","['Julius Centre for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131120,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Campylobacter/pathogenicity', 'Communicable Diseases/*microbiology/mortality/physiopathology', 'Cost of Illness', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Netherlands', '*Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Salmonella/pathogenicity']",PMC3835936,,,2013/11/28 06:00,2014/09/19 06:00,['2013/11/27 06:00'],"['2013/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-13-28049 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0079740 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 20;8(11):e79740. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0079740. eCollection 2013.,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,['PLoS One. 2013;8(12). doi:10.1371/annotation/caf33818-3453-4e30-b307-7526427b09b7'],,,,,,,['BCoDE consortium'],,"['Colzani, Edourdo', 'de Wit, G Ardine', 'Fevre, Eric', 'Franco, Elisabetta', 'Jahn, Beate', 'Kramer, Alexander', 'Longhi, Silvia', 'Matsi, Ardo', 'McDonald, Scott', 'Murianni, Laura', 'Pinheiro, Paulo', 'Ricciardi, Walter', 'Ruutel, Kristi', 'Siebert, Uwe']","['Colzani E', 'de Wit G', 'Fevre E', 'Franco E', 'Jahn B', 'Kramer A', 'Longhi S', 'Matsi A', 'McDonald S', 'Murianni L', 'Pinheiro P', 'Ricciardi W', 'Ruutel K', 'Siebert U']",,,

In this manuscript, we consider the dynamics of infectious diseases for which the primary mode of transmission is indirect and mediated by contact with a contaminated reservoir. We evaluate the realistic scenario in which the number of ingested pathogens must be above a critical threshold to cause infection in susceptible individuals. This minimal infectious dose is a consequence of the clearance effect of the innate immune system. Infected individuals shed pathogens back into the aquatic reservoir, indirectly increasing the transmittability of the pathogen to the susceptible. Building upon prior works in the study of cholera dynamics, we introduce and analyze a family of reservoir mediated SIR models with a threshold pathogen density for infection. Analyzing this family of models, we show that an outbreak can result from noninfinitesimal introductions of either infected individuals or additional pathogens in the reservoir. We devise two new measures of how likely it is that an environmentally persistent pathogen will cause an outbreak: (i) the minimum fraction of infected individuals; and (ii) the minimum fluctuation size of in-reservoir pathogens. We find an additional control parameter involving the shedding rate of infected individuals, which we term the pathogen enhancement ratio, which determines whether outbreaks lead to epidemics or endemic disease states. Thus, the ultimate outcome of disease is controlled by the strength of fluctuations and the global stability of a nonlinear dynamical system, as opposed to conventional analysis in which disease reflects the linear destabilization of a disease free equilibrium. Our model predicts that in the case of waterborne diseases, suppressing the pathogen density in aquatic reservoirs may be more effective than minimizing the number of infected individuals.",,"['Joh, Richard I', 'Wang, Hao', 'Weiss, Howard', 'Weitz, Joshua S']","['Joh RI', 'Wang H', 'Weiss H', 'Weitz JS']","['School of Physics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA. ijoh3@gatech.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20081219,United States,Bull Math Biol,Bulletin of mathematical biology,0401404,IM,"['Communicable Diseases/epidemiology/*immunology/*transmission', 'Disease Outbreaks', '*Disease Reservoirs', 'Humans', '*Models, Immunological', 'Population Dynamics']",,,,2008/12/20 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2008/12/20 09:00'],"['2008/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11538-008-9384-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Bull Math Biol. 2009 May;71(4):845-62. doi: 10.1007/s11538-008-9384-4.

These macroorganisms are exposed to and infected by a tremendous diversity of microorganisms. Those that are large enough can even be infected by multicellular fungi and parasites. Each interaction is unique, if only because it operates between two unique living organisms, in an infinite diversity of circumstances. This is neatly illustrated by the extraordinarily high level of interindividual clinical variability in human infections, even for a given pathogen, ranging from a total absence of clinical manifestations to death. We discuss here the idea that the determinism of human life-threatening infectious diseases can be governed by single-gene inborn errors of immunity, which are rarely Mendelian and frequently display incomplete penetrance. We briefly review the evidence in support of this notion obtained over the last two decades, referring to a number of focused and thorough reviews published by eminent colleagues in this issue of Human Genetics. It seems that almost any life-threatening infectious disease can be driven by at least one, and, perhaps, a great many diverse monogenic inborn errors, which may nonetheless be immunologically related. While the proportions of monogenic cases remain unknown, a picture in which genetic heterogeneity is combined with physiological homogeneity is emerging from these studies.

A significant proportion of the more than 18 million manuscripts indexed in the PubMed database describe infectious disease syndromes and various infectious agents. This study is the first attempt to integrate online repositories of text-based publications and microbial genome databases in order to explore the dynamics of relationships between pathogens and infectious diseases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Herein we demonstrate how the knowledge space of infectious diseases can be computationally represented and quantified, and tracked over time. The knowledge space is explored by mapping of the infectious disease literature, looking at dynamics of literature deposition, zooming in from pathogen to genome level and searching for new associations.

Examples of syndrome and pathogen networks illustrate how multilevel network representations of the relationships between infectious syndromes, pathogens and pathogen genomes can illuminate unexpected biological similarities in disease pathogenesis and epidemiology.

It seriously affects social stability and poses a significant threat to human health, requiring urgent measures to deal with them. Its outbreak will very easily lead to the large-scale spread of the virus, causing social problems such as work stoppages and traffic control, thereby causing social panic and psychological unrest, affecting human activities and social stability, and even endangering lives. It is essential to prevent and control the spread of infectious diseases effectively. PURPOSE: We aim to propose an effective method to classify the risk level of a new epidemic region by using graph theory and risk classification methods to provide a theoretical reference for the comprehensive evaluation and determination of epidemic prevention and control, as well as risk level classification. METHODS: Using the graph theory method, we first define the network structure of social groups and construct the risk transmission network of the new epidemic region. Then, combined with the risk classification method, the classification of high, medium, and low risk levels of the new epidemic region is discussed from two cases with common and looped graph nodes, respectively. Finally, the reasonableness of the classification method is verified by simulation data. RESULTS: The directed weighted scale-free network can better describe the transmission law of an epidemic. Moreover, the proposed method of classifying the risk level of a region by using the correlation function between two regions and the risk value of the regional nodes can effectively evaluate the risk level of different regions in the new epidemic region. The experiments show that the number of medium and high risk nodes shows no increasing trend. The number of high-risk regions is relatively small compared to medium-risk regions, and the number of low-risk regions is the largest. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to distinguish scientifically between the risk level of the epidemic area and the neighboring regions so that the constructed social network model of the epidemic region's spread risk can better describe the spread of the epidemic risk in the social network relations.","['Copyright (c) 2023 Liu, Wang and Zhang.']","['Liu, Yong', 'Wang, Xiao', 'Zhang, Chongqi']","['Liu Y', 'Wang X', 'Zhang C']","[""School of Science, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an, China."", ""School of Science, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an, China."", ""School of Science, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an, China."", 'School of Economics and Statistics, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20230925,Switzerland,Front Public Health,Frontiers in public health,101616579,IM,"['Humans', '*Communicable Diseases, Emerging/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Disease Outbreaks/prevention & control', '*Communicable Diseases/epidemiology', '*Epidemics', 'Computer Simulation']",PMC10561095,['NOTNLM'],"['emerging infectious diseases', 'epidemic', 'grading and zoning', 'graph theory', 'scale-free network']",2023/10/11 06:45,2023/11/02 12:46,['2023/10/11 03:56'],"['2023/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2023/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/11/02 12:46 [medline]', '2023/10/11 06:45 [pubmed]', '2023/10/11 03:56 [entrez]']",['10.3389/fpubh.2023.1211291 [doi]'],epublish,Front Public Health. 2023 Sep 25;11:1211291. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1211291. eCollection 2023.,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the same time, infectious agents are also secreting various proteins to neutralize the resistance caused by host cells and also helping the pathogens to develop the infection. Secretory proteins (secretome) are only developed at the time of host-pathogen interaction, therefore they become very important to develop the targeted and potential therapeutic strategies. Pathogen specific secretory proteins released during interaction with host cell provide opportunity to develop point of care and rapid diagnostic kits. Proteins secreted by pathogens at the time of interaction with host cell have also been found as immunogenic in nature and numbers of vaccines have been developed to control the spread of human infectious diseases.

During long sea voyages the agents of these diseases increased their diffusion capacity in a suitable environment. Lack of hygiene, fatigue and privations, a diet without vitamins and many persons kept in confined spaces were the essential features of this environment. Sick persons, whose health conditions worsened during the journey to the New World, carried the germs of infectious diseases. The first disease to appear in the New World was smallpox described in 1518 in Hispaniola. From there the disease moved rapidly to Mexico in 1520, exterminating most of the Aztecs, Guatemala and to the territories of Incas from 1525-26, killing most of them and the King himself. The second disease, influenza, appeared in La Isabela, a few years later, causing a heavy epidemic between 1558 and 1559. Other diseases followed such as yellow fever and malaria. So Europeans and these invisible and mortal agents caused enormous destruction of American populations.

The purpose of this study was to determine the findings in children who were initially thought to have an infectious disease but ultimately proved to have a malignancy. METHODS: The database of patients diagnosed with a malignancy in the Northern Alberta Children's Cancer Program (NACCP) January 1, 1993 to December 31, 2003 was merged with the database of inpatients referred to the infectious diseases service at the Stollery Children's Hospital and charts were reviewed on all patients referred to the infectious diseases consult service prior to the diagnosis of malignancy. RESULTS: An infectious diseases consultation for diagnosis was requested in 21 of 561 patients prior to the confirmation of malignancy, and 3 of these 21 patients had both infection and malignancy (leukemia (N = 13), lymphoma (N = 3), rhabdomyosarcoma (N = 1), Langerhan's cell histiocytosis (N = 1), fibrous histicocytosis (N = 1), ependymoma (N = 1), and neuroblastoma (N = 1). The most common reason for infectious diseases consultation was suspected muskuloskeletal infection (N = 9). A palpable or radiographically enlarged spleen was noted in 11 patients (52%). All but 2 patients had abnormal hematologic parameters while an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) occurred in 10 patients (48%). Delay of diagnosis because of investigation or therapy for an infectious disease occurred in only 2 patients. CONCLUSION: It is not common for treatment of pediatric malignancies to be delayed because infection is thought to be the primary diagnosis.

Although these two worlds are as a whole governed by the same laws of nature, they show substantial differences: the microbiological world is 1000 times older, and was initiated by the development of the archaea, the 'living organisms of the extreme': its biomass and its diversity are immense - two to three billion species or 60% of the total biomass of the planet. The number of pathogens that adapted to man, however, is extremely limited - barely 1000. Thus, over billions of years, an evolution of the microbial world took place from 'early life', characterized by chemosynthesis, to the 'modern pathogens', and entailed a dramatic 'concentration' of life conditions and an adaptation towards a narrow range of requirements - those allowing survival in the human body. Within the last two centuries, these two slowly evolving systems, microbial life and human life, were profoundly modified in an unprecedented manner by a third player, human civilization, with its global impact on the environment through physical, chemical, societal, and climatic determinants. An appreciation of the evolution of infectious diseases in the 21st century and of the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies therefore requires a full understanding of these three domains: human physiology, microbiology, and the environment. This review will put major emphasis on the environmental role of civilization on infectious diseases before considering new opportunities to combat them through novel and creative solutions.",,"['Waldvogel, Francis A']",['Waldvogel FA'],"['Medical Clinic 2, University Hospital, 1211 Geneva 14, Switzerland. francis.waldvogel@hcuge.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Canada,Int J Infect Dis,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,9610933,IM,"['*Civilization', 'Communicable Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Ecosystem', '*Global Health', 'Humans']",,,,2003/12/24 05:00,2004/04/06 05:00,['2003/12/24 05:00'],"['2003/12/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1201971203000109 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijid.2003.01.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Infect Dis. 2004 Jan;8(1):5-12. doi: 10.1016/j.ijid.2003.01.001.,,,,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,

The measures, usually consisting of a combination of border entry/exit screening, quarantine, isolation, and communications, were resource intensive, and modeling and observational studies indicate that border screening is not effective at detecting infectious persons. Moreover, border screening has high opportunity costs, financially and in terms of the use of scarce public health staff resources during a time of high need. We discuss the border-screening experiences with SARS and influenza and propose an approach to decision-making for future pandemics.

Fifty years ago, following the wide-scale manufacture and use of antibiotics and vaccines, it seemed that the battle against infections was being won for the human population. Since then, however, and in addition to increasing antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens, there has been an increase in the emergence of, mostly viral, zoonotic diseases from wildlife, sometimes causing fatal outbreaks of epidemic proportions. Concurrently, infectious disease has been identified as an increasing threat to wildlife conservation. A synthesis published in 2000 showed common anthropogenic drivers of disease threats to biodiversity and human health, including encroachment and destruction of wildlife habitat and the human-assisted spread of pathogens. Almost two decades later, the situation has not changed and, despite improved knowledge of the underlying causes, little has been done at the policy level to address these threats. For the sake of public health and wellbeing, human-kind needs to work better to conserve nature and preserve the ecosystem services, including disease regulation, that biodiversity provides while also understanding and mitigating activities which lead to disease emergence.

Ruminants, in particular, form the majority of the national herd and are a critical source of income for smallholder farmers. Infectious diseases have been identified as a major cause of reduced livestock productivity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); therefore, a sound and comprehensive understanding of the relevant evidence would be beneficial in order to enable decision making on disease control policies. However, livestock disease data from sub-Saharan Africa is variable and disparate, which poses a challenge for evidence synthesis. This paper describes a protocol for a systematic mapping review of the recent available evidence on ruminant disease prevalence and associated mortality in Ethiopia. Literature sources will be identified using database search strategies. The titles, abstracts and, subsequently, full texts will be screened for inclusion based on predefined eligibility criteria. Specific data will be extracted and a preliminary qualitative assessment of the evidence will be performed using predefined indicators.

The field of proteomics, or the study of the full array of proteins produced by an organism, has become the premier arena for the identification and characterization of proteins. Yet the task of characterizing a proteomic profile is more complex, in part because many unique proteins can be produced by the same gene product and because proteins have more diverse chemical structures making sequencing and identification more difficult.

In addition, the importance of regional and structural differences grows in our modern world. Little is known, though, about the consequences when traits of a disease vary regionally. In this paper, we study the effect of a spatially varying per capita infection rate on the behaviour of livestock diseases. We show that the prevalence of an infectious livestock disease in a community of animals can paradoxically decrease owing to transport connections to other communities in which the risk of infection is higher. We study the consequences for the design of livestock transportation restriction measures and establish exact criteria to discriminate those connections that increase the level of infection in the community from those that decrease it.",['(c) 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

RECENT FINDINGS: Significant inroads into the genetic basis of immune disorders leading to severe and recurrent infections in children have been made over the last few years. We now understand the specific susceptibility to herpes simplex virus encephalitis, the underlying cause of hyper IgE and Hermansky-Pudlak type 2 syndromes, as well as further explanations for the genotypic/phenotypic variations in severe combined immunodeficiency, common variable immunodeficiency and congenital neutropenia syndromes. Virulence factors for Staphylococcus aureus and Plasmodium falciparum have also been identified, and disease pathophysiology of respiratory syncytial virus related bronchiolitis and of acute pyelonephritis are better understood.

From 2008 to 2017, a total of 32 types and 1,994,740 cases of notifiable diseases were reported in children aged 0(-)14 years, including 266 deaths in Zhejiang Province. The annual average morbidity was 2502.87/100,000, and the annual average mortality was 0.33/100,000. Male morbidity was 2886.98/100,000, and female morbidity was 2072.16/100,000, with the male morbidity rate higher than the female morbidity rate (chi(2) = 54,033.12, p < 0.01). No Class A infectious diseases were reported. The morbidity of Class B infectious diseases showed a downward trend, but that of Class C infectious diseases showed an upward trend. There were 72,041 cases in 22 kinds of Class B infectious disease and 138 death cases, with a morbidity rate of 90.39/100,000, and a mortality rate of 0.17/100,000.

The extraordinary structural diversity of GAGs enables them to interact with a wide variety of biological molecules. Through these interactions, GAGs modulate various biological processes, such as cell adhesion, proliferation and migration, ECM assembly, tissue repair, coagulation, and immune responses, among many others. Studies during the last several decades have indicated that GAGs also interact with microbial pathogens. GAG-pathogen interactions affect most, if not all, the key steps of microbial pathogenesis, including host cell attachment and invasion, cell-cell transmission, systemic dissemination and infection of secondary organs, and evasion of host defense mechanisms.

The common problem of lower recruitment of women to clinical trials leads to the necessity to rely in clinical practice on the exchange of practical experiences, specialist consultations and individualization of treatment. As the COVID-19 pandemic shows, there is a close relationship between infectious diseases and civilization diseases. People suffering from chronic diseases are both more susceptible to infection and the more severe course of an infectious disease. On the other hand, infection may accelerate or initiate the onset of a noncommunicable disease. Women, especially those living with HIV, are a group with an underestimated risk of high blood pressure or some cancers. Therefore, one of the main goals of the conference is to break the stereotypes of thinking about health, in which gender is the main determinant of some screening tests. Late presentation of women to medical care is a significant problem that is of great importance in the diagnosis and treatment of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Women put family and professional responsibilities in the first place, and they are known to downplay their own health problems. It leads to the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases or cancer at the stage of advanced changes, limiting the possibilities of effective therapy. Understanding gender attributed differences in the etiology and epidemiology of diseases allows for the improvement of patient care, as well as determines the right direction of reforms in the area of healthcare. It is essential to build models of care based on an interdisciplinary and patient-centered approach, with broad support from both stakeholders and NGOs.

It is essential for the regulation of immune responses. A series of molecules transduce apoptoic signals and induce the characteristic morphological appearances of apoptotic cells. Infectious diseases modulate apoptosis and this contributes to disease pathogenesis. Infection with HIV results in enhanced levels of CD4 T-lymphocyte apoptosis in both directly infected cells and in uninfected bystander cells. A variety of HIV proteins including gp120 contribute to this process. A number of different pathways induce HIV-associated CD4 T-lymphocyte apoptosis and apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells is particularly associated with increased susceptibility to Fas. Other viruses including hepatitis viruses and the human herpesviruses also modulate apoptosis. Bacterial infection induces apoptosis which is frequently mediated by the direct activation of caspases in the absence of death receptor ligation. Bacterial induction of apoptosis may either be due to bacterial factors such as the invasin IpaB of Shigella flexneri or be the result of host immune responses which control infection as demonstrated in infections due to Mycobacterium spp. Apoptosis may be modulated by therapeutic strategies, such as antiretroviral therapy, and an improved understanding of infection-associated apoptosis modulation will aid the design of novel therapeutic approaches to control infectious diseases.",['Copyright 2001 The British Infection Society.'],"['Dockrell, D H']",['Dockrell DH'],"['Division of Genomic Medicine, University of Sheffield Medical School, Department of Infectious Diseases, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK. d.h.dockrell@shef.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,J Infect,The Journal of infection,7908424,IM,"['*Apoptosis/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Communicable Diseases/enzymology/immunology/*metabolism', 'HIV Infections/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Virus Diseases/metabolism']",,,,2001/09/08 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/09/08 10:00'],"['2001/09/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0163-4453(01)90836-9 [pii]', '10.1053/jinf.2001.0836 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect. 2001 May;42(4):227-34. doi: 10.1053/jinf.2001.0836.,,,,,,87,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of rising temperature include soil degradation, loss of productivity of agricultural land, desertification, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, reduced fresh-water resources, acidification of the oceans, and the disruption and depletion of stratospheric ozone. All these have an impact on human health, causing non-communicable diseases such as injuries during natural disasters, malnutrition during famine, and increased mortality during heat waves due to complications in chronically ill patients. Direct exposure to natural disasters has also an impact on mental health and, although too complex to be quantified, a link has even been established between climate and civil violence. Over time, climate change can reduce agricultural resources through reduced availability of water, alterations and shrinking arable land, increased pollution, accumulation of toxic substances in the food chain, and creation of habitats suitable to the transmission of human and animal pathogens. People living in low-income countries are particularly vulnerable. Climate change scenarios include a change in distribution of infectious diseases with warming and changes in outbreaks associated with weather extreme events. After floods, increased cases of leptospirosis, campylobacter infections and cryptosporidiosis are reported. Global warming affects water heating, rising the transmission of water-borne pathogens. Pathogens transmitted by vectors are particularly sensitive to climate change because they spend a good part of their life cycle in a cold-blooded host invertebrate whose temperature is similar to the environment. A warmer climate presents more favorable conditions for the survival and the completion of the life cycle of the vector, going as far as to speed it up as in the case of mosquitoes. Diseases transmitted by mosquitoes include some of the most widespread worldwide illnesses such as malaria and viral diseases. Tick-borne diseases have increased in the past years in cold regions, because rising temperatures accelerate the cycle of development, the production of eggs, and the density and distribution of the tick population. The areas of presence of ticks and diseases that they can transmit have increased, both in terms of geographical extension than in altitude. In the next years the engagement of the health sector would be working to develop prevention and adaptation programs in order to reduce the costs and burden of climate change.",,"['Rossati, Antonella']",['Rossati A'],"['Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital ""Maggiore della Carita"", Novara, Italy. arossati@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Occup Environ Med,The international journal of occupational and environmental medicine,101535763,IM,"['Agriculture', 'Climate Change', 'Communicable Diseases/epidemiology/etiology/transmission', 'Disasters', '*Environmental Health', '*Global Warming', 'Humans', '*Public Health']",PMC6679631,['NOTNLM'],"['Climate change', 'Communicable diseases, emerging', 'Global warming', 'Infectious disease medicine', 'Temperature', 'Tick-borne diseases', 'Weather']",2017/01/05 06:00,2017/08/26 06:00,['2017/01/05 06:00'],"['2016/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['963 [pii]', '10.15171/ijoem.2017.963 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Occup Environ Med. 2017 Jan;8(1):7-20. doi: 10.15171/ijoem.2017.963.,['None declared.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each mobile population (e.g. immigrants, refugees, travelers) has certain characteristics that determine public health risk and infectious disease burden. Refugees present unique challenges to public health officials and infectious disease specialists. RECENT FINDINGS: Refugee migration to the United States represents the most controlled population movement between countries from a health perspective. Medical screening and programs that provide presumptive treatment for highly prevalent infectious diseases both prior to and after migration alter the infectious disease epidemiology in these populations. SUMMARY: Infectious disease specialists must recognize that different characteristics of distinct mobile populations will alter infectious disease burden. This article specifically highlights how recent public health approaches have altered the epidemiology and clinical presentation of malaria, intestinal parasites and tuberculosis in refugee populations.",,"['Stauffer, William M', 'Weinberg, Michelle']","['Stauffer WM', 'Weinberg M']","['Department of Medicine and Pediatrics, Infectious Diseases and International Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. stauf005@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Current opinion in infectious diseases,8809878,IM,"['Communicable Diseases/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Global Health', 'Humans', '*Refugees']",,,,2009/07/10 09:00,2009/12/17 06:00,['2009/07/10 09:00'],"['2009/07/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/QCO.0b013e32832f14a4 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2009 Oct;22(5):436-42. doi: 10.1097/QCO.0b013e32832f14a4.,,,,,,37,,,,,,,,,,,

These tools have been developed in response to diagnostic methods that lack sensitivity, specificity, or rapid turnaround time, to assist with identification of agents that are difficult to cultivate or classify or as methods for assessing the effects of antiviral or antimicrobial agents in chronic infection. Molecular methods have also enabled microbiologists to define disease by the presence of virulence, toxin, or antimicrobial resistance genes and to identify potentially important clones of organisms responsible for outbreaks of infection.

Humans can actively influence controllable correlated health impacts by taking proactive measures, such as increasing our understanding of the detrimental effects associated with specific diseases and the patterns in climate change. We can also carefully distribute technology and resources, encouraging exercise and public awareness. It is advised to take the following adaption measures: Considering how infectious diseases and climate change are not the only things that science has discovered and create locally efficient early warning systems for those effects to produce more scientific justifications and go beyond scientific reports.

METHODS: The study included all patients hospitalized with travel-related diseases in 2015 at a Danish infectious diseases ward. Patient data was extracted from the in-patient hospital registry. was analyzed regarding diagnoses, destination, purpose of travel and pre-travel information. RESULTS: 240 patients were hospitalized with a total of 289 travel-related diseases, accounting for 16.6% (240/1450) of all admissions. Febrile illnesses were the most common (39.5%, 114/289) followed by respiratory (19.7%, 57/289) and gastrointestinal diagnoses (19.0%, 55/289). Most of the diseases were acquired in Sub-Saharan Africa (35.6%, 103/289) followed by South East Asia (27.0%, 78/289), and 60.0% (144/240) of the patients were tourists. One-third (36.3%, 81/223) of the non-migrants had received pre-travel information. The lowest rate was seen in people visiting friends and relatives (18.2%, 6/32). CONCLUSION: Travel-related diseases are common among patients admitted to this Danish infectious disease ward. Malaria is the most common disease among both travelers and immigrants.

Devastating epidemics of plague, smallpox, and cholera were frequent during the 18th and the 19th centuries. Other infectious diseases were a serious problem as well: alimentary tract infections, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough. Geographic position, climate, migrations, as well as the tradition and lack of medical staff and medications, affected the frequency and outcome of infections. THE HISTORY OF THE TREATMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Patients with infectious diseases were first treated at home. Later, a hospital in Visarion street was opened as an isolation facility and a hospital for homeless patients. The development of science and the education of medical personnel exerted the greatest influence on the control and later treatment of infectious diseases. These measures resulted in the establishment of the first specialized medical institutions in Novi Sad during the cholera outbreak in 1884. After that, temporary pediatric units were organized for the treatment of scarlet fever, diphtheria and smallpox. A ward for infectious diseases was founded in the The Great City Hospital in the second half of the 19th century (1892). The 20th century was a period of control and eradication of infectious diseases in Vojvodina (smallpox, malaria, diphtheria, polio). MODERN INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Nowdays, major infectious deseases include respiratory, alimentary and parasitic infections. However, new diseases are being registered as well - hemorrhagic fevers, Lyme disease, HIV infection. The Infectologic Service in Novi Sad was developed from an Infectology Departement as part of the Departement of Internal Diseases in the new Provincial Hospital (1909) to the independent Departement for Infectious Diseases (1945). Today, Clinic of lnfectious Diseases is an integral part of the Clinical Center of Vojvodina. DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES: The Department of Infectious Diseases of the Faculty of Medicine in Novi Sad was founded in 1960. Undergraduate studies started in 1963/64 for students of medicine and in 1978/79 jor dentistry students. Today. the faculty of the Department takes part in undergraduate studies of medicine, dentistry, health care, as well as in graduate programs. The faculty members are also taking part in specialization programs at the Faculty of Medicine. Infectious disease physicians are involved in the activities of the Infectology Section (founded in 1979) of the Society of Physicians of Vojvodine of the Medical Society of Serbia. The first president of the Infectology Section was Dr. Vera Mudric, professor, infectologists, whereas Dr. Grozdana Canak, professor, was the vice-president from 2000-2004.

The movement and relocation of populations between locations where the prevalence and incidence of infections are markedly different poses current and future challenges to those involved in clinical infectious diseases and public health program management. Historically, international attention has focused on the screening and treatment of acute infections of epidemic potential, but, as immigration significantly changes the demography of many nations, chronic infections will require increased attention. In countries with large mobile populations, the population-based burden of infections with long latency periods or significant noninfectious sequelae will make up an increasing amount of the infectious disease caseload and will require more-modern approaches than the traditional screening of arrivals.

Our objective was to give an overview on recommendations related to diagnostic and therapeutic issues in infectious diseases from the ""Top Five"" lists of different medical societies and countries. METHODS: 11 countries featuring specific interest in ""Choosing Wisely"" met in 2014 to learn from each other about their specific campaigns. These countries were checked for released ""Top Five"" lists and subsequently screened for issues related to infectious diseases (ID). Recommendations containing the terms ""infection"", ""antibiotics"", ""antimicrobials"", ""antifungals"", ""antivirals"", ""vaccination"", ""resistance"" and ""cultures"" were defined as related to ID. RESULTS: In 7 out of 11 countries ""Top Five"" lists have been released. Topics of infectious diseases were related to treatment, diagnostics and prevention and present in 51 out of 628 recommendations (8 %) in all countries except Japan. Notably, unnecessary use of antibiotics in upper respiratory tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria were cited by several societies from different countries.

Pharmacological strategies to modulate inflammation have been investigated, although the resulting guidelines have sometimes been contradictory. Steroids have been proposed as adjunctive treatments for bacterial meningitis, tuberculous meningitis and herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Well-designed randomized controlled trials have established dexamethasone as an adjunctive therapy for adult patients receiving antibiotics for bacterial meningitis, and physicians prescribing the initial antibiotics need to be aware of current guidelines. Morbidity and mortality in patients with tuberculous meningitis exceeds 50%. Steroid treatments reduce mortality through an as yet unknown mechanism, although their effects on morbidity are less clear. Herpes simplex virus encephalitis is also associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Despite a lack of randomized trials, there is some evidence that steroids used alongside antiviral therapy might be beneficial in this condition. As we discuss in this Review, systemic steroid treatment is an important aspect of treatment regimens for CNS infectious diseases, and the recent literature provides guidelines for the use of steroids in combination with appropriate antimicrobial therapy.",,"['Fitch, Michael T', 'van de Beek, Diederik']","['Fitch MT', 'van de Beek D']","['Department of Neurology, Center of Infection and Immunity Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Nat Clin Pract Neurol,Nature clinical practice.

These drugs aim to eliminate microbes and are remarkably effective against susceptible organisms. Nonetheless, some patients succumb to infectious diseases despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Today, with very few exceptions, physicians select antimicrobial therapy based on its activity against the targeted organism without consideration of how the regimen affects patients' immune responses. An important concept to emerge in the past few decades is that immune responses to microbes can be detrimental by enhancing host damage, which can translate into clinical disease. A central tenet of the damage-response framework (DRF) of microbial pathogenesis is that the relevant outcome of host-microbe interaction is the damage that occurs in the host, which can be due to microbial factors, host factors, or both. Given that host damage can make patients sick, reducing it should be a goal of treating infectious diseases. Inflammation and damage that stem from the host response to an infectious disease can increase during therapy with some antimicrobial agents and decrease during therapy with others. When a patient cannot eliminate a microbe with their own immune response, antimicrobial therapy is essential for microbial elimination, and yet it can affect the inflammatory response. In this essay, we discuss antimicrobial therapy in the context of the DRF and propose that consideration of the DRF may help tailor therapy to a patient's need to augment or reduce inflammation.",['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Pirofski, Liise-Anne', 'Casadevall, Arturo']","['Pirofski LA', 'Casadevall A']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA Acasade1@jhu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200127,United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,IM,"['Anti-Infective Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Communicable Diseases/*drug therapy/immunology/microbiology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immunity/*drug effects', 'Inflammation/*prevention & control']",PMC6985739,['NOTNLM'],"['antimicrobial', 'damage', 'immunity']",2019/11/20 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2019/11/20 06:00'],"['2019/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['AAC.01800-19 [pii]', '01800-19 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.01800-19 [doi]']",epublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2020 Jan 27;64(2):e01800-19. doi: 10.1128/AAC.01800-19.

Recent studies, since 1996 in particular, have challenged this view. A newly recognised group of primary immunodeficiencies predisposing the individual to a principal or single type of infection is emerging. In parallel, several common infections have been shown to reflect the inheritance of one major susceptibility gene, at least in some populations. This novel causal relationship (one gene, one infection) blurs the distinction between patient-based Mendelian genetics and population-based complex genetics, and provides a unified conceptual frame for exploring the molecular genetic basis of infectious diseases in humans.",,"['Casanova, Jean-Laurent', 'Abel, Laurent']","['Casanova JL', 'Abel L']","['Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases, University of Paris Rene Descartes, INSERM, U550, Necker Medical School, Paris, France. casanova@necker.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20070125,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Communicable Diseases/*genetics/*immunology', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genetic Variation', '*Genetics, Medical', 'Humans', '*Models, Immunological']",PMC1852849,,,2007/01/27 09:00,2007/04/06 09:00,['2007/01/27 09:00'],"['2006/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['7601558 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7601558 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2007 Feb 21;26(4):915-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7601558.

RESULTS: 127 infectious diseases were diagnosed, the most frequent being those of respiratory etiology and later malaria. Geographically Africa and embarked contingents were the most significant. It was necessary to evacuate 18 patients to the HCDGU, being the diagnosis of malaria the most frequent reason for evacuation, cause of the only fatal case. CONCLUSIONS: infectious diseases benefit from the application of TM, being an important tool for the diagnosis and treatment of these, constituting an opportunity to expand to other displaced or remote populations.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Sociedad Espanola de Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiologia', 'Clinica.

A 2005-2015 systematic review.,653,10.1186/s12879-019-4285-8 [doi] 653,"BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis of Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO) is very extensive, and includes infectious diseases (ID), neoplasms and noninfectious inflammatory diseases (NIID). Many FUO remain undiagnosed. Factors influencing the final diagnosis of FUO are unclear. METHODS: To identify factors associated with FUO diagnostic categories, we performed a systematic review of classical FUO case-series published in 2005-2015 and including patients from 2000. Moreover, to explore changing over time, we compared these case-series with those published in 1995-2004. RESULTS: Eighteen case-series, including 3164 patients, were included. ID were diagnosed in 37.8% of patients, NIID in 20.9%, and neoplasm in 11.6%, FUO were undiagnosed in 23.2%. NIIDs significantly increased over time. An association exists between study country income level and ID (increasing when the income decreases) and undiagnosed FUO (increasing when the income increases); even if not significant, the use of a pre-defined Minimal Diagnostic Work-up to qualify a fever as FUO seems to correlate with a lower prevalence of infections and a higher prevalence of undiagnosed FUO. The multivariate regression analysis shows significant association between geographic area, with ID being more frequent in Asia and Europe having the higher prevalence of undiagnosed FUO. Significant associations were found with model of study and FUO defining criteria, also. CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in diagnostics, FUO still remains a challenge, with ID still representing the first cause. The main factors influencing the diagnostic categories are the income and the geographic position of the study country.",,"['Fusco, Francesco Maria', 'Pisapia, Raffaella', 'Nardiello, Salvatore', 'Cicala, Stefano Domenico', 'Gaeta, Giovanni Battista', 'Brancaccio, Giuseppina']","['Fusco FM', 'Pisapia R', 'Nardiello S', 'Cicala SD', 'Gaeta GB', 'Brancaccio G']","[""Infectious Diseases Unit 1, S.

Domestic livestock, wildlife and humans share many similar pathogens. Pathogens of wild or domestic animal origin that can cause infections in humans are known as zoonotic organisms and the converse are termed as anthroponotic organisms. Seventy-seven percent of livestock pathogens and 91% of domestic carnivore pathogens are known to infect multiple hosts, including wildlife. Understanding this group of pathogens is critical to public health safety, because they infect a wide range of hosts and are most likely to emerge as novel causes of infection in humans and domestic animals. Diseases at the wildlife-livestock interface, particularly those that are zoonotic, must be an area of focus for public health programs and surveillance for emerging infectious diseases. Additionally, understanding wildlife and their role is a vital part of understanding the epidemiology and ecology of diseases. To do this, a multi-faceted approach combining capacity building and training, wildlife disease surveillance, wildlife-livestock interface and disease ecology studies, data and information sharing and outbreak investigation are needed.",,"['Siembieda, J L', 'Kock, R A', 'McCracken, T A', 'Newman, S H']","['Siembieda JL', 'Kock RA', 'McCracken TA', 'Newman SH']","['Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Emergency Prevention System (EMPRES) for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases, Wildlife Health and Ecology Unit, Animal Production and Health Division, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110527,England,Anim Health Res Rev,Animal health research reviews,101083072,IM,"['Animals', '*Animals, Wild', 'Communicable Diseases/epidemiology/microbiology/transmission/*veterinary', 'Disease Reservoirs/*veterinary', '*Livestock']",,,,2011/05/28 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/05/28 06:00'],"['2011/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S1466252311000041 [pii]', '10.1017/S1466252311000041 [doi]']",ppublish,Anim Health Res Rev. 2011 Jun;12(1):95-111. doi: 10.1017/S1466252311000041.

Rapid and simple tests that do not require killing animals are valuable for this purpose. In this study, we developed a multiplex immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for detection of antibodies to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), Sendai virus (also known as hemagglutinating virus of Japan [HVJ]), and Clostridium piliforme (The pathogen that causes Tyzzer disease), which are major infectious diseases in mice. For this assay, an ICA strip was put into a microtube containing 150 muL PBS and either 0.75 muL mouse serum or 1.5 muL whole blood. Binding antibodies were visualized by using protein A-conjugated colloidal gold. Under these conditions, multiplex ICA simultaneously and specifically detected antibodies to multiple antigens. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of multiplex ICA, positive serum samples for each infectious disease were used. Sensitivities of the multiplex ICA test for MHV, HVJ, and C. piliforme were 100%, 100%, and 90%, respectively. No nonspecific reaction was observed in any of the 30 positive sera. In addition, 10 samples of uninfected sera did not show any bands except for the control line. These observations indicate high specificity of the multiplex ICA test. Moreover, the multiplex ICA could be applied to diluted blood. These results indicate that the multiplex ICA is appropriate for rapid, simple, and safe serologic testing of laboratory mice.",,"['Tosa, Noriko', 'Ishida, Tomoko', 'Yoshimatsu, Kumiko', 'Hayashimoto, Nobuhito', 'Shiokawa, Kanae', 'Takakura, Akira', 'Arikawa, Jiro']","['Tosa N', 'Ishida T', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Hayashimoto N', 'Shiokawa K', 'Takakura A', 'Arikawa J']","['Institute for Animal Experimentation, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'ICLAS Monitoring Center, Central Institute for Experimental Animals, Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan;, Email: yosimatu@med.hokudai.ac.jp.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'ICLAS Monitoring Center, Central Institute for Experimental Animals, Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Institute for Animal Experimentation, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190913,United States,J Am Assoc Lab Anim Sci,Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science : JAALAS,101269489,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Laboratory', 'Communicable Diseases/blood/diagnosis/*veterinary', 'Immunoassay/methods/*veterinary', 'Laboratory Animal Science', 'Mice', 'Rodent Diseases/blood/*diagnosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",PMC6926397,,,2019/09/15 06:00,2020/06/18 06:00,['2019/09/15 06:00'],"['2019/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['2019000790 [pii]', '10.30802/AALAS-JAALAS-19-000008 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Assoc Lab Anim Sci. 2019 Nov 1;58(6):790-795. doi: 10.30802/AALAS-JAALAS-19-000008.

Microbiologists are often part of such teams, along with public health specialists, clinicians and entomologists, and can contribute to the response in multiple ways. The role of a microbiologist is critical not only for laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases, but also for situational analysis and evaluation, planning, prevention and control. The task begins with risk assessment, specifically for identification of diseases epidemic and endemic to the area. Evaluation of existing laboratory setups and establishment of services where none exist is a priority, including facilitation of a tiered laboratory system. Training of laboratory staff at short notice in field settings, biosafety and biomedical waste management are niche areas where microbiologists can contribute. Emerging focus areas include establishment of modular laboratories, infection prevention and control in community evacuation centres and considerations for reopening of healthcare facilities closed due to extensive natural damage. A trained and efficient microbiologist will prove a valuable asset to provide timely and useful support for infectious disease diagnosis, prevention, control and management in the wake of natural disasters.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Prevention of the spread of infectious pathogens requires rapid and accurate identification of the infectious agents for proper treatment. Recently developed fluorescent nanoparticles are so sensitive that even a single nanoparticle is capable of emitting a strong enough signal to be captured, thus enabling early identification of infections. Proper and effective treatment not only saves the patient, but also prevents the spread of the pathogens. Specific nanoparticle vehicles developed to encapsulate therapeutic agents and deliver them to a target site represent a promising strategy to boost immune responses for vaccination and boost the efficacy of drugs for treatment.

The transformation used gave upward trend time variations for infectious diseases, providing strong evidence that in Italy during the first half of this century variations in infectious diseases preceded variations in cancer. While some bacteria and viruses are known to be cancer agents, sparse studies indicate that a host's immune response to infection may destroy cancer cells. With a decreasing mortality from infectious illnesses, there may have been a reduction in the activation of immunological mechanisms against transformed cells in early phases of carcinogenesis.

It depends on the duration of the infectious period, the probability of infecting a susceptible individual during one contact, and the number of new susceptible individuals contacted per unit of time. Therefore R0 may vary considerably for different infectious diseases but also for the same disease in different populations. The key threshold result of epidemic theory associates the outbreaks of epidemics and the persistence of endemic levels with basic reproduction numbers greater than one. Because the magnitude of R0 allows one to determine the amount of effort which is necessary either to prevent an epidemic or to eliminate an infection from a population, it is crucial to estimate R0 for a given disease in a particular population.

A contemporary understanding of the frequency and variety of patients and syndromes seen by ID services has implications for training, service development and setting research priorities. We performed a 2-week prospective survey of formal ID physician activities related to direct inpatient care, encompassing 53 hospitals throughout Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, and documented 1722 inpatient interactions. Infections involving the skin and soft tissue, respiratory tract and bone/joints together accounted for 49% of all consultations. Suspected/confirmed pathogens were primarily bacterial (60%), rather than viral (6%), fungal (4%), mycobacterial (2%) or parasitic (1%). Staphylococcus aureus was implicated in 409 (24%) episodes, approximately four times more frequently than the next most common pathogen. The frequency of healthcare-related infections (35%), immunosuppression (21%), diabetes mellitus (19%), prosthesis-related infections (13%), multiresistant pathogens (13%) and non-infectious diagnoses (9%) was high, although consultation characteristics varied between geographical settings and hospital types. Our study highlights the diversity of inpatient-related ID activities and should direct future teaching and research. ID physicians' ability to offer beneficial consultative advice requires broad understanding of, and ability to interact with, a wide range of referring specialities.","['(c) 2014 The Authors Clinical Microbiology and Infection (c) 2014 European Society of', 'Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.']","['Ingram, P R', 'Cheng, A C', 'Murray, R J', 'Blyth, C C', 'Walls, T', 'Fisher, D A', 'Davis, J S']","['Ingram PR', 'Cheng AC', 'Murray RJ', 'Blyth CC', 'Walls T', 'Fisher DA', 'Davis JS']","['Department of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Australia; School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140306,England,Clin Microbiol Infect,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,9516420,IM,"['Australia/epidemiology', 'Communicable Diseases/classification/epidemiology/etiology/*therapy', 'Data Collection', 'Hospital Departments', 'Humans', 'Inpatients', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', ""*Physician's Role"", 'Physicians', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Singapore/epidemiology', 'Time']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Australia', 'New Zealand', 'Singapore', 'consultations', 'infectious diseases']",2014/02/06 06:00,2015/07/23 06:00,['2014/02/06 06:00'],"['2013/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S1198-743X(14)65414-8 [pii]', '10.1111/1469-0691.12581 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Microbiol Infect. 2014 Oct;20(10):O737-44. doi: 10.1111/1469-0691.12581.

The main approach used to date is one that nests within-host models of pathogen replication in models for the between-host spread of infectious diseases. Although this provides an elegant approach, it nevertheless suffers from some practical difficulties. In particular, the information required to satisfactorily model the mechanistic details of the within-host dynamics is not often available. Here, we present a theoretical approach that circumvents these difficulties by quantifying the relevant within-host factors in an empirically tractable way. The approach is closely related to quantitative genetic models for function-valued traits, and it also allows for the prediction of general characteristics of disease life history, including the timing of virulence, transmission, and host recovery. In a companion paper, we illustrate the approach by applying it to data from a model system of malaria.",['(c) 2011 The Author(s).

Animal sniffing is an innate behaviour, and animals' olfactory acuity is used for detecting people, weapons, bombs, narcotics and food. OBJECTIVES: We briefly summarized current knowledge regarding the use of sniffing animals to diagnose some infectious diseases and the potential use of scent-based diagnostic instruments in microbiology. SOURCES: Information was sought through PubMed and extracted from peer-reviewed literature published between January 2000 and September 2019 and from reliable online news. The search terms 'odour', 'scent', 'bacteria', 'diagnostics', 'tuberculosis', 'malaria' and 'volatile compounds' were used. CONTENT: Four major areas of using sniffing animals are summarized. Dogs have been used to reliably detect stool associated with toxigenic Clostridioides difficile and for surveillance. Dogs showed high sensitivity and moderate specificity for detecting urinary tract infections in comparison to culture, especially for Escherichia coli. African giant pouched rats showed superiority for diagnosing tuberculosis over microscopy, but inferiority to culture/molecular methods. Several approaches for detecting malaria by analysing host skin odour or exhaled breath have been explored successfully. Some microbial infections produce specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can be analysed by spectrometry, metabolomics or other analytical approaches to replace animal sniffing. IMPLICATIONS: The results of sniffing animal studies are fascinating, and animal sniffing can provide intermediate diagnostic solutions for some infectious diseases. Lack of reproducibility, and cost of animal training and housing are major drawbacks for wider implementation of sniffing animals. The ultimate goal is to understand the biological background of this animal ability and to characterize the specific VOCs that animals are recognizing. VOC identification, improvement of odour sampling methods and development of point-of-care instruments could allow implementation of scent-based tests for major human pathogens.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

This forecoming revolution will position molecular theranostics in a broader integrated view of personalized medicine, which exploits genetic information from microbes and human hosts to optimize patient management and disease treatment.",,"['Bissonnette, Luc', 'Bergeron, Michel G']","['Bissonnette L', 'Bergeron MG']","['Departement de Biologie Medicale (Microbiologie), Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Canada. luc.bissonnette@crchul.ulaval.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Expert Rev Mol Diagn,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,101120777,IM,"['Communicable Diseases/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'Drug Design', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Genetics, Medical', 'Humans', '*Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Personal Health Services', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics/*methods']",,,,2006/05/19 09:00,2006/07/18 09:00,['2006/05/19 09:00'],"['2006/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/05/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1586/14737159.6.3.433 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Mol Diagn. 2006 May;6(3):433-50. doi: 10.1586/14737159.6.3.433.,,,"['0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)']",,,184,,,,,,,,,,,

Travelers' diarrhea is the most common and caused by diarrheagenic E. coli and other patho- gens. Undifferentiated fever challenges physicians to correctly diagnose and includes ma- laria, dengue, and enteric fever. The pre-test probability for a disease which causes undiffer- entiated fever largely depends on the travel destination. Malaria is most common in travelers returning from sub-Saharan Africa while dengue is most common those returning from Southeast Asia and Latin America. Screening for asymptomatic travelers is not generally rec- ommended, but for long-term travelers and immigrants. Following outbreaks of highly infectious diseases in the past decades, hospital prepared- ness for travel-related infections focuses on infection prevention and control. Emerging viral pneumonias such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and avian influenza H7N9 are major concerns. As seen in the largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, imported viral hemorrhagic fever such as Lassa fever is another concern. Since multidrug resistant bacteria silently spread globally by infected travelers, it would be of help to install appropriate isolation precaution for travelers with history of hospital admission abroad.",,"['Kato, Yasuyuki']",['Kato Y'],,['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Nihon Rinsho,Nihon rinsho.

While not approved as CDx, several ID diagnostics are used as CDx. The diagnostics community, manufacturers, and regulatory agencies have made major efforts to ensure that diagnostics for new antimicrobials are available at or near release of new agents. AREAS COVERED: This review highlights the status of Complementary and companion diagnostic (c/CDx) in the infectious disease literature, with a focus on genotypic antimicrobial resistance testing against pathogens as a class of diagnostic tests. EXPERT OPINION: CRISPR, sepsis markers, and narrow spectrum antimicrobials, in addition to current and emerging technologies, present opportunities for infectious disease c/CDx. Challenges include slow guideline revision, high costs for regulatory approval, lengthy buy in by agencies, discordant pharmaceutical/diagnostic partnerships, and higher treatment costs. The number of patients and available medications used to treat different infectious diseases is well suited to support competing diagnostic tests. However, newer approaches to treatment (for example, narrow spectrum antibiotics), may be well suited for a small number of patients, i.e. a niche market in support of a CDx. The current emphasis is rapid and point-of-care (POC) diagnostic platforms as well as changes in treatment.",,"['Dailey, Peter J', 'Elbeik, Tarek', 'Holodniy, Mark']","['Dailey PJ', 'Elbeik T', 'Holodniy M']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley , Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'The Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) , Geneva, Switzerland.', 'VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Department of Veterans Affairs , Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Department of Veterans Affairs , Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Stanford University , Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200213,England,Expert Rev Mol Diagn,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,101120777,IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Infective Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Communicable Diseases/diagnosis/*drug therapy/microbiology/virology', 'Device Approval', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Development', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial/*genetics', 'Genotyping Techniques', 'Humans', '*Microbial Sensitivity Tests', '*Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', '*Point-of-Care Testing', 'Precision Medicine/*methods', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Infectious diseases', 'anti-infective agents', 'antimicrobial drug resistance', 'diagnostics']",2020/02/08 06:00,2021/10/05 06:00,['2020/02/08 06:00'],"['2020/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737159.2020.1724784 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Mol Diagn. 2020 Jun;20(6):619-636. doi: 10.1080/14737159.2020.1724784.
