The aim of this review was to examine heterogeneous links among the various phenotypes of obesity in adults. Proteins and associated genes in each group were analysed to differentiate between biomarkers. A variety of terms for classification and characterization within this pathology are currently in use; however, there is no clear consensus in terminology. The most significant groups reviewed include metabolically healthy obese, metabolically abnormal obese, metabolically abnormal, normal weight and sarcopenic obese. These phenotypes do not define particular genotypes or epigenetic gene regulation, or proteins related to inflammation. There are many other genes linked to obesity, though the value of screening all of those for diagnosis has low predictive results, as there are no significant biomarkers. It is important to establish a consensus in the terminology used and the characteristics attributed to obesity subtypes. The identification of specific molecular biomarkers is also required for better diagnosis in subtypes of obesity.","['Mayoral, Laura Perez-Campos', 'Andrade, Gabriel Mayoral', 'Mayoral, Eduardo Perez-Campos', 'Huerta, Teresa Hernandez', 'Canseco, Socorro Pina', 'Rodal Canales, Francisco J', 'Cabrera-Fuentes, Hector Alejandro', 'Cruz, Margarito Martinez', 'Perez Santiago, Alma Dolores', 'Alpuche, Juan Jose', 'Zenteno, Edgar', 'Ruiz, Hector Martinez', 'Cruz, Ruth Martinez', 'Jeronimo, Julia Hernandez', 'Perez-Campos, Eduardo']","['Mayoral LP', 'Andrade GM', 'Mayoral EP', 'Huerta TH', 'Canseco SP', 'Rodal Canales FJ', 'Cabrera-Fuentes HA', 'Cruz MM', 'Perez Santiago AD', 'Alpuche JJ', 'Zenteno E', 'Ruiz HM', 'Cruz RM', 'Jeronimo JH', 'Perez-Campos E']","['Research Centre-Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico-Benito Juarez Autonomous University of Oaxaca, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Research Centre-Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico-Benito Juarez Autonomous University of Oaxaca, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Research Centre-Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico-Benito Juarez Autonomous University of Oaxaca, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'CONACyT-Faculty of Medicine, Benito Juarez Autonomous University of Oaxaca, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Research Centre-Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico-Benito Juarez Autonomous University of Oaxaca, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Research Centre-Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico-Benito Juarez Autonomous University of Oaxaca, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disorders Program, Duke-National University of Singapore, Singapore; Institute of Biochemistry, Medical School, Justus-Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.', 'National Technological Institute of Mexico, ITOaxaca, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'National Technological Institute of Mexico, ITOaxaca, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Research Centre-Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico-Benito Juarez Autonomous University of Oaxaca, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Research Centre-Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico-Benito Juarez Autonomous University of Oaxaca, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Research Centre-Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico-Benito Juarez Autonomous University of Oaxaca, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Research Centre-Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico-Benito Juarez Autonomous University of Oaxaca, Oaxaca, Mexico.', 'Research Centre-Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico-Benito Juarez Autonomous University of Oaxaca, Oaxaca, Mexico.', ""National Technological Institute of Mexico, ITOaxaca; Clinical Pathology Laboratory 'Dr. Eduardo Perez Ortega' Oaxaca, Mexico.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Biomarkers', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Obesity/classification/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins/*genetics']",PMC7055173,['NOTNLM'],"['Adipose tissue', 'HOMA', 'biomarkers', 'body fat', 'genome-wide association studies', 'heterogeneity', 'obesity', 'subtypes']",['None'],2020/03/07 06:00,2021/01/20 06:00,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJMedRes_2020_151_1_11_279134 [pii]', 'IJMR-151-11 [pii]', '10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_1768_17 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2020 Jan;151(1):11-21. doi: 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_1768_17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is proposed that obesity, generally defined by an excess of body fat causing prejudice to health, can no longer be evaluated solely by the body mass index (expressed in kg/m(2)) because it represents a heterogeneous entity. For instance, several cardiometabolic imaging studies have shown that some individuals who have a normal weight or who are overweight are at high risk if they have an excess of visceral adipose tissue-a condition often accompanied by accumulation of fat in normally lean tissues (ectopic fat deposition in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, etc). On the other hand, individuals who are overweight or obese can nevertheless be at much lower risk than expected when faced with excess energy intake if they have the ability to expand their subcutaneous adipose tissue mass, particularly in the gluteal-femoral area. Hence, excessive amounts of visceral adipose tissue and of ectopic fat largely define the cardiovascular disease risk of overweight and moderate obesity. There is also a rapidly expanding subgroup of patients characterized by a high accumulation of body fat (severe obesity). Severe obesity is characterized by specific additional cardiovascular health issues that should receive attention. Because of the difficulties of normalizing body fat content in patients with severe obesity, more aggressive treatments have been studied in this subgroup of individuals such as obesity surgery, also referred to as metabolic surgery. On the basis of the above, we propose that we should refer to obesities rather than obesity.","['Piche, Marie-Eve', 'Tchernof, Andre', 'Despres, Jean-Pierre']","['Piche ME', 'Tchernof A', 'Despres JP']","[""From the Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Quebec - Universite Laval (M.-E.P., A.T., J.-P.D.), Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada."", 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine (M.-E.P.), Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada.', ""From the Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Quebec - Universite Laval (M.-E.P., A.T., J.-P.D.), Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada."", 'School of Nutrition (A.T.), Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada.', ""From the Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Quebec - Universite Laval (M.-E.P., A.T., J.-P.D.), Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada."", 'Vitam - Centre de recherche en sante durable, CIUSSS - Capitale-Nationale (J.-P.D.), Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Kinesiology, Faculty of Medicine (J.-P.D.), Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/*pathology/prevention & control', 'Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Obesity/epidemiology/*pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['body fat distribution', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'diabetes mellitus', 'heart failure', 'obesity']",,2020/05/22 06:00,2021/05/18 06:00,['2020/05/22 06:00'],"['2020/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316101 [doi]'],ppublish,Circ Res. 2020 May 22;126(11):1477-1500. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316101.

This paper explores alternative ways to assess the potential disease impact of the epidemic, which is currently based almost exclusively on body mass index (BMI) data. It also argues in favor of concerted efforts to modify the built ecosystem that is driving the obesity epidemic. Most of the epidemiologic data on obesity are based on BMI (in kg/m2) and use the ranges of 18.5-24.9 for normality, 25-29.9 for overweight, and >/=30 for obesity. But the gap between the median of the ""normal"" BMI distribution ( approximately 22) and the current population BMI of, for example, the United States (27.7) has become so wide that it is unlikely that we will be able to close that gap in the near future. Furthermore, the correlation between BMI and disease risk is not linear. Over 60% of the global disease burden of obesity affects individuals with a BMI >/=30, who comprise only  approximately 10% of the global population of overweight/obese persons. Furthermore, BMI accounts for only  approximately 17% of the risk of insulin resistance and subsequent type 2 diabetes in the BMI >/=25 population. Epigenetics, specifically DNA methylation, appears to play a far more important role than BMI in determining the risk of obesity's comorbidities, such as diabetes. Similarly, socioeconomic status carries a higher risk than BMI level for the development of obesity-related noncommunicable diseases. Finally, the built environment that sustains our species' lifestyle is a major driver of the obesity epidemic. Modifying that ecosystem will require no less than a social movement, one able to promote and sustain the necessary coordinated action of virtually all sectors of society.","['Caballero, Benjamin']",['Caballero B'],"['Global Obesity Prevention Center, Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Adv Nutr,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",101540874,,IM,"['*Body Mass Index', 'Comorbidity', '*Cost of Illness', 'DNA Methylation', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/etiology', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment Design', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Global Health', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Life Style', 'Obesity/complications/epidemiology/genetics/*prevention & control', 'Social Class']",PMC6363526,,,,2019/02/06 06:00,2020/08/28 06:00,['2019/02/06 06:00'],"['2017/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S2161-8313(22)00195-8 [pii]', 'nmy055 [pii]', '10.1093/advances/nmy055 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Nutr. 2019 Jan 1;10(suppl_1):S4-S9. doi: 10.1093/advances/nmy055.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While there is a sizable amount of data demonstrating that obesity is a state of low-grade inflammation, to our knowledge, there is no single review summarizing its effects on hematologic parameters and thrombotic risk. We performed a literature search which largely surfaced observational studies, with a few systematic reviews and meta-analyses of these studies. We took care to review the mechanisms driving an inflammatory state and obesity's effect on white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets, and thrombotic risk. There is an observed relative, and sometimes absolute leukocytosis driven by this inflammatory state. Obesity is also associated with increased platelet counts and an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Lastly, the association between obesity, iron deficiency (ID), and red blood cell counts may be present but remains uncertain. Recognizing the above associations may provide clinicians with reassurance regarding otherwise unexplained hematologic abnormalities in obese individuals. We hope this review will prompt future studies to further understand the underlying mechanisms driving these abnormalities and identify modifiable risk factors and potential therapeutic targets to prevent the development of probable obesity-associated conditions with significant morbidity and mortality, such as ID and VTE.","['Purdy, Johanna C', 'Shatzel, Joseph J']","['Purdy JC', 'Shatzel JJ']","['Division of General Internal Medicine and Geriatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cytokines/blood/metabolism', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Inflammation Mediators/blood/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis', 'Obesity/*blood/*complications/etiology/metabolism', 'Sex Factors']",PMC8086364,['NOTNLM'],"['anemia', 'iron deficiency', 'leukocytosis', 'thrombocytosis', 'venous thromboembolism']","['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: J.J.S. is a consultant for Aronora, Inc.

Sustained weight loss of more than 10% overall bodyweight improves many of the complications associated with obesity (eg, prevention and control of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver disease, and obstructive sleep apnoea), as well as quality of life. Maintenance of weight loss is the major challenge of obesity management. Like all chronic diseases, managing obesity requires a long-term, multimodal approach, taking into account each individual's treatment goals, and the benefit and risk of different therapies. In conjunction with lifestyle interventions, anti-obesity medications and bariatric surgery improve the maintenance of weight loss and associated health gains. Most available anti-obesity medications act on central appetite pathways to reduce hunger and food reward. In the past 5 years, therapeutic advances have seen the development of targeted treatments for monogenic obesities and a new generation of anti-obesity medications. These highly effective anti-obesity medications are associated with weight losses of more than 10% of overall bodyweight in more than two-thirds of clinical trial participants. Long-term data on safety, efficacy, and cardiovascular outcomes are awaited. Long-term studies have shown that bariatric surgical procedures typically lead to a durable weight loss of 25% and rapid, sustained improvements in complications of obesity, although they have not yet been compared with new-generation highly effective anti-obesity medications. Further work is required to determine optimal patient-specific treatment strategies, including combinations of lifestyle interventions, anti-obesity medications, endoscopic and bariatric surgical procedures, and to ensure equitable access to effective treatments.","['Perdomo, Carolina M', 'Cohen, Ricardo V', 'Sumithran, Priya', 'Clement, Karine', 'Fruhbeck, Gema']","['Perdomo CM', 'Cohen RV', 'Sumithran P', 'Clement K', 'Fruhbeck G']","['Department of Endocrinology and Nutrition, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; Metabolic Research Laboratory, CIBEROBN, ISCIII, IdiSNA, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'The Center for Obesity and Diabetes, Oswaldo Cruz German Hospital, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', ""Department of Medicine, St Vincent's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; Department of Endocrinology, Austin Health, Melbourne, VIC, Australia."", 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and obesities: systemic approach research group, Nutriomics, Paris, France; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Nutrition Department, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Nutrition, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; Metabolic Research Laboratory, CIBEROBN, ISCIII, IdiSNA, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.

Obesity is associated with many adverse maternal and fetal effects prenatally, but it also exerts a negative influence on female fertility. Obese women are more likely to have ovulatory dysfunction due to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome who are also obese demonstrate a more severe metabolic and reproductive phenotype. Obese women have reduced fecundity even when eumenorrheic and demonstrate poorer outcomes with the use of in vitro fertilization. Obesity appears to affect the oocyte and the preimplantation embryo, with disrupted meiotic spindle formation and mitochondrial dynamics. Excess free fatty acids may have a toxic effect in reproductive tissues, leading to cellular damage and a chronic low-grade inflammatory state. Altered levels of adipokines, such as leptin, in the obese state can affect steroidogenesis and directly affect the developing embryo. The endometrium is also susceptible, with evidence of impaired stromal decidualization in obese women. This may explain subfecundity due to impaired receptivity, and may lead to placental abnormalities as manifested by higher rates of miscarriage, stillbirth, and preeclampsia in the obese population. Many interventions have been explored to mitigate the effect of obesity on infertility, including weight loss, physical activity, dietary factors, and bariatric surgery. These data are largely mixed, with few high quality studies to guide us. As we improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity in human reproduction we hope to identify novel treatment strategies.","['Broughton, Darcy E', 'Moley, Kelle H']","['Broughton DE', 'Moley KH']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.

Recent years have witnessed a dramatic rise in the prevalence of obesity worldwide, stimulating interest in the health and quality of life consequences of this phenomenon. The body of research on the quality of life of obese individuals has grown to a point that a review of this literature is warranted. Numerous studies have demonstrated that obese persons experience significant impairments in quality of life as a result of their obesity, with greater impairments associated with greater degrees of obesity. Weight loss has been shown to improve quality of life in obese persons undergoing a variety of treatments. Further research is needed to clarify whether quality of life differs among subsets of obese persons. Until recently, there has been little standardization of quality of life measures in obesity. The SF-36 has been used in a number of studies of obese persons. Several obesity-specific instruments have also been developed and have shown great promise. The quality of life of obese individuals is an important issue that should be included in weight management treatment and research.","['Kolotkin, R L', 'Meter, K', 'Williams, G R']","['Kolotkin RL', 'Meter K', 'Williams GR']","['Duke University Medical Center, Department of Psychiatry, Durham, NC, USA. kolot001@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Obes Rev,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,100897395,,IM,"['Ethnicity', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/epidemiology/*physiopathology/*psychology', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Weight Loss']",,,,,2002/07/18 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/07/18 10:00'],"['2002/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1467-789x.2001.00040.x [doi]'],ppublish,Obes Rev. 2001 Nov;2(4):219-29. doi: 10.1046/j.1467-789x.2001.00040.x.,,,,,,,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contrary to just being a medical condition or risk factor for other diseases, obesity is a complex disease of multifaceted aetiology, with its own disabling capacities, pathophysiologies and comorbidities. It meets the medical definition of disease in that it is a physiological dysfunction of the human organism with environmental, genetic and endocrinological aetiologies. It is a response to environmental stimuli, genetic predisposition and abnormalities, and has a characteristic set of signs and symptoms with consistent anatomical alterations. Excess adipose tissue increases the work of the heart and leads to anatomical changes in this organ. It alters pulmonary, endocrine and immunological functions, all with adverse effects on health. Some of the complications of obesity include cardiovascular disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis and cancer. Given the excess mortality, substantial morbidity and the economic toll of obesity, this is a disease that warrants serious attention by the medical community. Obesity's status and acceptance as a disease is pivotal in determining its treatment, reimbursement for treatment and the development of widespread interventions.","['Conway, B', 'Rene, A']","['Conway B', 'Rene A']","['Department of Epidemiology, The University of North Texas School of Public Health, 3500 Camp Bowie Boulevard, EAD-709B, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA. baqiyyah@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Obes Rev,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,100897395,,IM,"['Body Composition', '*Environment', 'Humans', 'Immunity', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Joint Diseases/etiology', 'Obesity/*classification/complications/physiopathology', 'Respiration', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,2004/07/13 05:00,2004/10/27 09:00,['2004/07/13 05:00'],"['2004/07/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['OBR144 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1467-789X.2004.00144.x [doi]']",ppublish,Obes Rev. 2004 Aug;5(3):145-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2004.00144.x.,,,,,,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The search terms we used were: ""obesity, paradox, adipose tissue"" in combination with ""cardiovascular, coronary heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmias"". Using the current Body Mass Index (BMI)-based obesity definition, individuals with different clinical and biochemical characteristics are gathered together in the same category. Emerging evidence point to the existence of many ""Obesity phenotypes"" with different association with CV risk, accordingly to physical and life-style features. In this narrative review, we discussed if obesity phenotypes may be associated with a different CV risk, potentially explaining the OP. As a globally accepted definition of obesity is still lacking, we emphasized the need of a new approach, which should consider the heterogeneity of obesity. Better defining ""obesities"" and related CV risk is critical to markedly improve the classical BMI-based definition of obesity.","['Vecchie, Alessandra', 'Dallegri, Franco', 'Carbone, Federico', 'Bonaventura, Aldo', 'Liberale, Luca', 'Portincasa, Piero', 'Fruhbeck, Gema', 'Montecucco, Fabrizio']","['Vecchie A', 'Dallegri F', 'Carbone F', 'Bonaventura A', 'Liberale L', 'Portincasa P', 'Fruhbeck G', 'Montecucco F']","['First Clinic of Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, 6 viale Benedetto XV, 16132 Genoa, Italy.', ""First Clinic of Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, 6 viale Benedetto XV, 16132 Genoa, Italy; Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico per l'Oncologia, 10 Largo Benzi, 16132 Genoa, Italy."", 'First Clinic of Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, 6 viale Benedetto XV, 16132 Genoa, Italy.', 'First Clinic of Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, 6 viale Benedetto XV, 16132 Genoa, Italy.', 'First Clinic of Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, 6 viale Benedetto XV, 16132 Genoa, Italy; Centre for Molecular Cardiology, University of Zurich, 12 Wagistrasse, 8952 Schlieren, Switzerland.', 'Clinica Medica ""A.

However, increased fat mass does not fully explain obesity's propensity to promote metabolic diseases. With chronic obesity, adipose tissue undergoes major remodeling, which can ultimately result in unresolved chronic inflammation leading to fibrosis accumulation. These features drive local tissue damage and initiate and/or maintain multiorgan dysfunction. Here, we review the current understanding of adipose tissue remodeling with a focus on obesity-induced adipose tissue fibrosis and its relevance to clinical manifestations.","['Marcelin, Genevieve', 'Silveira, Ana Leticia M', 'Martins, Lais Bhering', 'Ferreira, Adaliene Vm', 'Clement, Karine']","['Marcelin G', 'Silveira ALM', 'Martins LB', 'Ferreira AV', 'Clement K']","['Nutrition and Obesities: Systemic Approaches (NutriOmics, UMRS U1269), INSERM, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Nutrition and Obesities: Systemic Approaches (NutriOmics, UMRS U1269), INSERM, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Immunometabolism, Department of Nutrition, Nursing School, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Nutrition and Obesities: Systemic Approaches (NutriOmics, UMRS U1269), INSERM, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Immunometabolism, Department of Nutrition, Nursing School, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Immunometabolism, Department of Nutrition, Nursing School, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Nutrition and Obesities: Systemic Approaches (NutriOmics, UMRS U1269), INSERM, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Nutrition Department, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,,IM,"['Adipocytes/pathology', 'Adipose Tissue/blood supply/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/pathology', 'Metabolic Diseases/etiology', 'Mice', 'Myofibroblasts/pathology', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'Obesity/complications/*pathology', 'Stem Cells/pathology']",PMC6763252,,,"['Conflict of interest: The authors have declared that no conflict of interest', 'exists.']",2019/09/10 06:00,2020/06/09 06:00,['2019/09/10 06:00'],"['2019/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['129192 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI129192 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2019 Oct 1;129(10):4032-4040. doi: 10.1172/JCI129192.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review focuses on the recent proceedings concerning genesis, prevention, and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Identifying genetic variants in well phenotyped small cohorts of extremely obese children (e.g., the search for copy number variants in obesity-associated large chromosomal deletions) confirmed afterwards in large population-based studies is a new promising genetic approach to understand the disposition to obesity. A further important finding is that obesity of mothers predisposes their offsprings to obesity by epigenetic, prenatal effects. Therefore, prevention programs targeting parents even before pregnancy should be developed. Prevention programs in kindergarten and schools without involving the parents failed to fight against the obesity epidemic. A new promising prevention approach is to change the environment (e.g., ban on sugar drinks in schools). Therapy of choice in already obese children is lifestyle intervention. Again, including their parents is crucial for success. However, this kind of intervention is only suitable for families motivated to change their lifestyle habits. Especially in extremely obese adolescents, additional therapeutic approaches such as drugs and bariatric surgery have to be considered. SUMMARY: Even if of knowledge of childhood obesity improves every year, many questions concerning prevention and treatment remain still open. Future longitudinal research has to focus on which children will benefit from which kind of intervention to develop specific therapies.","['Reinehr, Thomas', 'Wabitsch, Martin']","['Reinehr T', 'Wabitsch M']","['Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Diabetes and Nutrition Medicine, Vestische Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Witten/Herdecke, Datteln, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Lipidol,Current opinion in lipidology,9010000,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*epidemiology/prevention & control/therapy']",,,,,2010/09/28 06:00,2011/04/19 06:00,['2010/09/28 06:00'],"['2010/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOL.0b013e32833f9c37 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Lipidol. 2011 Feb;22(1):21-5. doi: 10.1097/MOL.0b013e32833f9c37.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, much attention has been drawn to the contribution of the gut microbiota in the development of obesity. Indeed, research has shown that in contrast to their healthier counterparts the microbiomes of obese individuals are structurally and functionally distinct, strongly suggesting microbiome as a potential target for obesity therapeutics. In particular, pre and probiotics have emerged as effective and integrative means of modulating the microbiome, in order to reverse the microbial dysbiosis associated with an obese phenotype. The following review brings forth animal and human research supporting the myriad of mechanisms by which the microbiome affects obesity, as well as the strengths and limitations of probiotic or prebiotic supplementation for the prevention and treatment of obesity.

This report is available on the website of the French Health Authority (HAS). In addition to severe obesity, patients often display obesity-related comorbidities and neuropsychological/psychiatric disorders. These complex conditions make clinical management particularly challenging. Early diagnosis is critical for the organization of coordinated specialized multidisciplinary care, with mandatory interaction between caregivers, social partners and families. Strategies to prevent aggravation of obesity consist in limiting access to food, establishing a reassuring daily eating environment, and the practice of sustained adapted supervised daily physical activity. The implementation of genetic diagnosis in clinical practice now enables a personalized medicine approach with access to new drug therapies, and improves the analysis of the risk/benefit ratio of bariatric surgery.","['Dubern, Beatrice', 'Mosbah, Helena', 'Pigeyre, Marie', 'Clement, Karine', 'Poitou, Christine']","['Dubern B', 'Mosbah H', 'Pigeyre M', 'Clement K', 'Poitou C']","['Paris Public Hospitals, PRADORT Competence Centre, Department of Paediatric Nutrition and Gastroenterology, CHU Trousseau, Paris, France; Sorbonne University/INSERM, Research Unit: Nutrition and Obesities; Systemic Approaches, NutriOmics, Paris, France.', 'Paris Public Hospitals, Reference Centre for Rare Diseases PRADORT (PRADer-Willi Syndrome and other Rare Obesities with Eating Disorders), Nutrition Department, Pitie-Salpetriere hospital, Paris, France.', 'Population Health Research Institute, David Braley Cardiac, Vascular and Stroke Research Institute, Hamilton, ON, Canada; Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Michael G.

Obese women, especially those with central obesity, are less likely to conceive per cycle. Obese women suffer from perturbations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis, disturbances of the menstrual cycle and are up to three times more likely to suffer from oligo/anovulation. A delicate hormonal balance regulates follicular development and the maturation of oocytes and it has been observed that obesity can alter the hormonal environment: adipocytes, in fact, are responsible for the production of a hormone called leptin (present in high quantities in obese women) which has been associated with reduced fecundity. In addition to compromising ovulation, obesity negatively affects the development and implantation of the endometrium. The expression of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is regulated, in part, by weight, so obese women with PCOS often have a more severe phenotype and higher subfertility rates. Furthermore, obesity impairs women's response to medically assisted procreation (MAP) treatments.

Being a complex and heritable disorder, obesity results from the interplay between genetic susceptibility, epigenetics, metagenomics and the environment. Attempts at understanding the genetic basis of obesity have identified numerous genes associated with syndromic monogenic, non-syndromic monogenic, oligogenic and polygenic obesity. The genetics of leanness are also considered relevant as it mirrors some of obesity's aetiologies. In this report, we summarize ten genetically elucidated obesity syndromes, some of which are involved in ciliary functioning. We comprehensively review 11 monogenic obesity genes identified to date and their role in energy maintenance as part of the leptin-melanocortin pathway. With the emergence of genome-wide association studies over the last decade, 227 genetic variants involved in different biological pathways (central nervous system, food sensing and digestion, adipocyte differentiation, insulin signalling, lipid metabolism, muscle and liver biology, gut microbiota) have been associated with polygenic obesity. Advances in obligatory and facilitated epigenetic variation, and gene-environment interaction studies have partly accounted for the missing heritability of obesity and provided additional insight into its aetiology. The role of gut microbiota in obesity pathophysiology, as well as the 12 genes associated with lipodystrophies is discussed. Furthermore, in an attempt to improve future studies and merge the gap between research and clinical practice, we provide suggestions on how high-throughput '-omic' data can be integrated in order to get closer to the new age of personalized medicine.","['Pigeyre, Marie', 'Yazdi, Fereshteh T', 'Kaur, Yuvreet', 'Meyre, David']","['Pigeyre M', 'Yazdi FT', 'Kaur Y', 'Meyre D']","['Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4L8, Canada INSERM UMR 1190, Department of Nutrition, University of Lille, CHRU Lille, Lille, 59000, France.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4L8, Canada.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4L8, Canada.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4L8, Canada Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4L8, Canada meyred@mcmaster.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Clin Sci (Lond),"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,['0 (Leptin)'],IM,"['Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', '*Leptin/genetics/metabolism', '*Metagenomics', 'Obesity/epidemiology/*genetics/*physiopathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['epigenetics', 'genetics', 'leanness', 'metagenomics', 'obesity and body fat distribution', 'pathophysiology', 'personalized medicine']",,2016/05/08 06:00,2017/04/12 06:00,['2016/05/08 06:00'],"['2015/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['CS20160136 [pii]', '10.1042/CS20160136 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Sci (Lond). 2016 Jun 1;130(12):943-86. doi: 10.1042/CS20160136.,,,,"['(c) 2016 The Author(s).

PE is thought to originate from ischemic insults in the placenta driving the release of prohypertensive anti-angiogenic [soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1)] and proinflammatory [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)] factors into the maternal circulation. Whereas the increased incidence of PE is hypothesized to be largely due to the obesity pandemic, the mechanisms whereby obesity increases this risk are unknown. The maternal endothelium is targeted by placental and adipose tissue-derived factors like sFlt-1 and TNF-alpha that promote hypertension during pregnancy, resulting in vascular dysfunction and hypertension. Interestingly, not all obese pregnant women develop PE. Data suggest that obese pregnant women with the greatest metabolic abnormalities have the highest incidence of PE. Identifying obesity-related mechanisms driving hypertension in some obese pregnant women and pathways that protect normotensive obese pregnant women, may uncover novel protocols to treat PE. Metabolic abnormalities, such as increased circulating leptin, glucose, insulin, and lipids, are likely to increase the risk for PE in obese women. It is not only important to understand whether each of these metabolic factors contribute to the increased risk for PE in obesity, but also their cumulative effects. This is particularly relevant to obese pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) where all of these factors are increased and the risk for PE is highest. It is speculated that these factors potentiate the anti-angiogenic and proinflammatory mechanisms of placental ischemia-induced vascular dysfunction thereby contributing to the increasing incidence of PE.","['Spradley, Frank T']",['Spradley FT'],"[""Department of Surgery, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Cardiovascular-Renal Research Center, Women's Health Research Center, The University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi fspradley@umc.edu.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol,"American journal of physiology.

Obesity in childhood is associated with many immediate consequences, including orthopedic, neurologic, pulmonary, gastroenterologic, endocrinologic, metabolic, and cardiovascular disorders. Psychosocial and economic problems also are seen in obese adolescents. Long-term consequences of pediatric obesity include risks for cardiovascular disease and death that are independent of adult body weight. The differential diagnosis of pediatric obesity includes many multi-system genetic syndromes and a limited number of endocrine disorders that include abnormalities in the leptin signaling pathway, but most children with excess body weight do not have an established diagnosis. Treatment is best carried out at specialized centers, and usually involves a program of behavioral modification, caloric restriction, increased activity, and decreased sedentary behaviors.

However, the relationship between the two disorders is not straightforward and most likely represents an interaction of demographic, genetic, hormonal, renal, and hemodynamic factors. Age, race, and sex also modulate the strength of the association between obesity and hypertension. Hyperinsulinemia, which is characteristic of obesity, can contribute to the probability of developing hypertension by activating the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and by causing sodium retention. The pressor effect of insulin in obesity may be further enhanced by the observation that its vasodilator action can be blunted in obese subjects. Preliminary data have shown that leptin, whose levels are increased in most obese individuals, can contribute to hypertension in obesity through its effects on insulin, SNS, and sodium excretion. The kidney may also have a role in the pathophysiology of hypertension in obesity. Abnormal renal sodium handling coupled with structural changes in the kidney of an obese patient can raise blood pressure. In addition, obesity is associated with distinct cardiovascular hemodynamic alterations and development of eccentric myocardial hypertrophy. Most of these obesity-associated abnormalities, as well as hypertension itself, can be reversed by weight loss. Furthermore, weight loss can prevent, or at least delay, the development of hypertension in patients with high-normal blood pressure. Weight reduction should be the first-line treatment in every obese hypertensive patient. However, the majority of patients will need pharmacologic intervention in conjunction with weight loss. Selection of antihypertensive agents in the overweight patient should take into account the mechanisms leading to hypertension and the metabolic abnormalities that characterize the obese patient.","['Mikhail, N', 'Golub, M S', 'Tuck, M L']","['Mikhail N', 'Golub MS', 'Tuck ML']","['Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Prog Cardiovasc Dis,Progress in cardiovascular diseases,0376442,['0 (Antihypertensive Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Diet, Reducing', 'Energy Intake', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Obesity/*complications/epidemiology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Sex Factors']",,,,,1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0033062099700083 [pii]', '10.1016/s0033-0620(99)70008-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Prog Cardiovasc Dis. 1999 Jul-Aug;42(1):39-58. doi: 10.1016/s0033-0620(99)70008-3.,,,,,,,152,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies showed that childhood and adolescent obesities increased the incidence of cardiovascular disease risk factors and were linked to higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adulthood.

'Obesity' is not a sufficient definition for patients, any more than 'cancer' or 'arthritis' would be. A major obstacle is the lack of understanding of pathogenesis. The disease of obesity is considered homogenous, while response to treatment is thought of as heterogeneous. This can change if pathogenesis, risk profiles for complications, and treatment responses are viewed within the context of obesity consisting of several subsets of disease. AREAS COVERED: The European Union-funded Innovative Medicine Initiative project Stratification of Obesity Phenotypes to Optimize Future Obesity Therapy is part of a momentum shift. Operational variables are being used to develop tests and therapies which may allow the prediction of risk of obesities and the prediction of response to obesity treatments. However, changing stakeholder perspectives on obesity may require more than high-quality data and analysis. EXPERT OPINION: For patients to benefit, clinicians need to integrate evidence-based treatments and payers need to reimburse the management of the disease of obesity. This will generate commercial opportunities for industry. We need to involve stakeholders (patients, clinicians, regulators, payer, patient organisations) to create a shared value for mutual gain.","['Tahrani, Abd A', 'Panova-Noeva, Marina', 'Schloot, Nanette C', 'Hennige, Anita M', 'Soderberg, Jeannette', 'Nadglowski, Joe', 'Tarasenko, Lisa', 'Ahmad, Nadia N', 'Sleypen, Barbara Sc', 'Bravo, Rafael', 'Al-Najim, Werd', 'le Roux, Carel W']","['Tahrani AA', 'Panova-Noeva M', 'Schloot NC', 'Hennige AM', 'Soderberg J', 'Nadglowski J', 'Tarasenko L', 'Ahmad NN', 'Sleypen BS', 'Bravo R', 'Al-Najim W', 'le Roux CW']","['Novo Nordisk A/S, soborg, Denmark.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co.

Twin and adoption studies demonstrate a large genetic component to obesity, especially in adults. However, the increasing prevalence of obesity over the last 20 years can only be explained by environmental factors.

Obese children and adults uniformly underreport the amount of food they eat. Obesity is particularly related to increased consumption of high-fat foods. BMI is a quick and easy way to screen for childhood obesity. Treating childhood obesity relies on positive family support and lifestyle changes involving the whole family. Food preferences are influenced early by parental eating habits, and when developed in childhood, they tend to remain fairly constant into adulthood. Children learn to be active or inactive from their parents. In addition, physical activity (or more commonly, physical inactivity) habits that are established in childhood tend to persist into adulthood. Weight loss is usually followed by changes in appetite and metabolism, predisposing individuals to regain their weight. However, when the right family dynamics exist--a motivated child with supportive parents--long-term success is possible.","['Strauss, R']",['Strauss R'],"['Division of Pediatric GI and Nutrition, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Probl Pediatr,Current problems in pediatrics,1272515,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Appetite', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Obesity/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Physical Examination', 'Prevalence', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,,1999/01/27 00:00,1999/01/27 00:01,['1999/01/27 00:00'],"['1999/01/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0045-9380(99)80011-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0045-9380(99)80011-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Probl Pediatr. 1999 Jan;29(1):1-29. doi: 10.1016/s0045-9380(99)80011-5.,,,,,,,251,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IBD is an immune-mediated condition that appears to develop in individuals who have not only a genetic predisposition to immune dysregulation but also likely exposure to various environmental factors which further potentiate this risk. With the surge in obesity alongside the rising incidence of IBD, particularly in developing nations, the role that obesity may play, not only in the pathogenesis but also in the natural history of disease has become a topic of growing interest. Currently available data exploring obesity's impact on the natural history of IBD are largely conflicting, potentially limited by the use of body mass index as a surrogate measure of obesity at varying time points throughout the disease course. While there are pharmacokinetic data to suggest possible detrimental effects that obesity may have on the response to medical therapy, results in this realm are also inconsistent. Moreover, not only is it unclear whether weight loss improves IBD outcomes, little is known about the safety and efficacy of available weight-loss strategies in this population. For these reasons, it becomes increasingly important to further understand the nature of any interaction between obesity and IBD.","['Johnson, Amanda M', 'Loftus, Edward V']","['Johnson AM', 'Loftus EV']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street Southwest, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street Southwest, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",India,Saudi J Gastroenterol,Saudi journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Saudi Gastroenterology Association,9516979,,IM,"['Body Mass Index', '*Colitis, Ulcerative', 'Humans', '*Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/epidemiology', 'Obesity/complications/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",PMC8448008,['NOTNLM'],"[""Crohn's disease"", 'inflammatory bowel disease', 'obesity', 'ulcerative colitis']",['None'],2021/06/26 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/06/25 08:42'],"['2021/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/06/25 08:42 [entrez]']","['319164 [pii]', 'SJG-27-183 [pii]', '10.4103/sjg.sjg_30_21 [doi]']",ppublish,Saudi J Gastroenterol. 2021 Jul-Aug;27(4):183-190. doi: 10.4103/sjg.sjg_30_21.,,,,,,,,['Saudi J Gastroenterol. 2021 Sep-Oct;27(5):316.

Indeed, the current knowledge of the white adipose tissue, which shifts its role from an energy storage tissue to an important endocrine and metabolic organ, has opened up new avenues for the discovery of obesity's effects on tumor biology. In this review, we will report the epidemiological studies concerning the strong impact of obesity in several types of cancer and describe the mechanisms underlying the heterotypic signals between cancer cell lines and adipocytes, with particular emphasis on inflammation, the insulin/IGF-1 axis, and adipokines. Among the adipokines, we will further describe the in vitro, in vivo, and clinical data concerning the role of leptin, recognized as one of the most important mediators of obesity-associated cancers. In fact, leptin physiologically regulates energy metabolism, appetite, and reproduction, and several studies have also described the role of leptin in affecting cancer development and progression. Finally, we will summarize the newest pharmacological strategies aimed at mitigating the protumorigenic effects of leptin, underlining their mechanisms of action.","['Caruso, Amanda', 'Gelsomino, Luca', 'Panza, Salvatore', 'Accattatis, Felice Maria', 'Naimo, Giuseppina Daniela', 'Barone, Ines', 'Giordano, Cinzia', 'Catalano, Stefania', 'Ando, Sebastiano']","['Caruso A', 'Gelsomino L', 'Panza S', 'Accattatis FM', 'Naimo GD', 'Barone I', 'Giordano C', 'Catalano S', 'Ando S']","['Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, Via P Bucci, University of Calabria, Arcavacata di Rende (CS), 87036 Cosenza, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, Via P Bucci, University of Calabria, Arcavacata di Rende (CS), 87036 Cosenza, Italy.', 'Centro Sanitario, Via P.

Genetic obesities, including monogenic and syndromic obesities, are rare and complex neuro-endocrine pathologies where the genetic contribution is predominant. Severe and early-onset obesity with eating disorders associated with frequent comorbidities make these diseases challenging. Their current estimated prevalence of 5-10% in severely obese children is probably underestimated due to the limited access to genetic diagnosis. A central alteration of hypothalamic regulation of weight implies that the leptin-melanocortin pathway is responsible for the symptoms. The management of genetic obesity has so far been only based, above all, on lifestyle intervention, especially regarding nutrition and physical activity. New therapeutic options have emerged in the last years for these patients, raising great hope to manage their complex situation and improve quality of life. Implementation of genetic diagnosis in clinical practice is thus of paramount importance to allow individualized care. This review describes the current clinical management of genetic obesity and the evidence on which it is based. Some insights will also be provided into new therapies under evaluation.","['Faccioli, Nathan', 'Poitou, Christine', 'Clement, Karine', 'Dubern, Beatrice']","['Faccioli N', 'Poitou C', 'Clement K', 'Dubern B']","['Sorbonne Universite, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Department of Pediatric Nutrition and Gastroenterology, Trousseau Hospital, Paris, France', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and Obesity: Systemic Approaches, NutriOmics, Research Unit, Paris, France', 'Reference Center for Rare Diseases (PRADORT, Prader-Willi Syndrome and Other Rare Forms of Obesity with Eating Behavior Disorders), Paris, France', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and Obesity: Systemic Approaches, NutriOmics, Research Unit, Paris, France', 'Reference Center for Rare Diseases (PRADORT, Prader-Willi Syndrome and Other Rare Forms of Obesity with Eating Behavior Disorders), Paris, France', 'Sorbonne Universite, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Nutrition Department, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and Obesity: Systemic Approaches, NutriOmics, Research Unit, Paris, France', 'Reference Center for Rare Diseases (PRADORT, Prader-Willi Syndrome and Other Rare Forms of Obesity with Eating Behavior Disorders), Paris, France', 'Sorbonne Universite, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Nutrition Department, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France', 'Sorbonne Universite, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Department of Pediatric Nutrition and Gastroenterology, Trousseau Hospital, Paris, France', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and Obesity: Systemic Approaches, NutriOmics, Research Unit, Paris, France', 'Reference Center for Rare Diseases (PRADORT, Prader-Willi Syndrome and Other Rare Forms of Obesity with Eating Behavior Disorders), Paris, France']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Turkey,J Clin Res Pediatr Endocrinol,Journal of clinical research in pediatric endocrinology,101519456,,IM,"['Humans', 'Child', '*Quality of Life', '*Pediatric Obesity/genetics/therapy', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Comorbidity']",PMC10234057,['NOTNLM'],"['Genetic obesity', 'syndromic obesity', 'personalized medicine', 'setmelanotide']",,2023/05/16 13:10,2023/05/31 06:42,['2023/05/16 08:36'],"['2023/05/31 06:42 [medline]', '2023/05/16 13:10 [pubmed]', '2023/05/16 08:36 [entrez]']","['60461 [pii]', '10.4274/jcrpe.galenos.2023.2023-3-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Res Pediatr Endocrinol. 2023 May 29;15(2):108-119. doi: 10.4274/jcrpe.galenos.2023.2023-3-2.

It is a dynamic, complex, and multifactorial disease which propitiates the development of several metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, as well as cancer. Excessive adipose tissue has been causally related to cancer progression and is a preventable risk factor for overall and cancer-specific survival, associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. The onset of obesity features a state of chronic low-grade inflammation and secretion of a diversity of adipocyte-derived molecules (adipokines, cytokines, hormones), responsible for altering the metabolic, inflammatory, and immune landscape. The crosstalk between adipocytes and tumor cells fuels the tumor microenvironment with pro-inflammatory factors, promoting tissue injury, mutagenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Although classically established as a risk factor for cancer and treatment toxicity, recent evidence suggests mild obesity is related to better outcomes, with obese cancer patients showing better responses to treatment when compared to lean cancer patients. This phenomenon is termed obesity paradox and has been reported in different types and stages of cancer. The mechanisms underlying this paradoxical relationship between obesity and cancer are still not fully described but point to systemic alterations in metabolic fitness and modulation of the tumor microenvironment by obesity-associated molecules. Obesity impacts the response to cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and has been reported as having a positive association with immune checkpoint therapy. In this review, we discuss obesity's association to inflammation and cancer, also highlighting potential physiological and biological mechanisms underlying this association, hoping to clarify the existence and impact of obesity paradox in cancer development and treatment.","['Assumpcao, Jose Antonio Fagundes', 'Pasquarelli-do-Nascimento, Gabriel', 'Duarte, Mariana Saldanha Viegas', 'Bonamino, Martin Hernan', 'Magalhaes, Kelly Grace']","['Assumpcao JAF', 'Pasquarelli-do-Nascimento G', 'Duarte MSV', 'Bonamino MH', 'Magalhaes KG']","['Laboratory of Immunology and Inflammation, Department of Cell Biology, University of Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Inflammation, Department of Cell Biology, University of Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.', 'Immunology and Tumor Biology Program - Research Coordination, Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Immunology and Tumor Biology Program - Research Coordination, Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Vice - Presidency of Research and Biological Collections (VPPCB), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Inflammation, Department of Cell Biology, University of Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil. kellymagalhaes@unb.br.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,['0 (Adipokines)'],IM,"['Adipocytes', 'Adipokines', 'Adipose Tissue', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammation', '*Neoplasms/complications/therapy', '*Obesity/complications', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC8842976,['NOTNLM'],"['Adipose tissue', 'Cancer', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammation', 'Obesity']",['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],2022/02/16 06:00,2022/02/17 06:00,['2022/02/15 05:31'],"['2021/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2022/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/02/15 05:31 [entrez]', '2022/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/02/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12929-022-00796-0 [pii]', '796 [pii]', '10.1186/s12929-022-00796-0 [doi]']",epublish,J Biomed Sci. 2022 Feb 14;29(1):12. doi: 10.1186/s12929-022-00796-0.,,20220214,,['(c) 2022.

However, an inverse association between BMI and mortality has been reported in patients with many disease states and in several clinical settings: hemodialysis, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, surgery, etc. This unexpected phenomenon is usually called obesity-survival paradox (OP). The contiguous concepts of metabolically healthy obesity (MHO, a phenotype having BMI >/= 30 but not having any metabolic syndrome component and having a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, HOMA, <2.5) and metabolically obese normal weight (MONW, normal-weight individuals displaying obesity-related phenotypic characteristics) have received a great deal of attention in recent years. The interactions that link MHO, MONW and OP with body composition, fat distribution, aging and cardiorespiratory fitness are other crucial areas of research. The article is an introductory narrative overview of the origin and current use of the concepts of MHO, MONW and OP. These phenomena are very controversial and appear as a consequence of the frail current diagnostic definition of obesity based only on BMI.

METHODS: Systematic review of epidemiological evidence linking obesity to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) was performed for studies published from 2005 to 2010. The current understanding of obesity's role in the etiology and potential dysplastic progression of Barrett's esophagus (BE) to EA is reviewed. RESULTS: Accumulating epidemiological studies provide evidence of obesity's role as a driving force behind the increasing rates of EA. The simplest construct is that obesity promotes reflux, causing chronic inflammation and BE, predisposing to adenocarcinoma. However, as obesity is positively associated with the prevalence of many cancers, other mechanisms are important. A link may exist between fat distribution patterns and the risk of BE and EA. Altered metabolic profiles in the metabolic syndrome (MetS) may be a key factor in cell cycle/genetic abnormalities that mark the progression of BE towards cancer. Research highlighting a unique role of MetS in the length of BE, and its association with systemic inflammation and insulin resistance is discussed, as well as adipokine receptor expression in both BE and esophageal epithelium, and how MetS and the systemic response impacts on key regulators of inflammation and tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS/IMPACT: Obesity is positively associated with EA. The systemic inflammatory state consequent on the altered metabolism of obese patients, and the associated impact of adipocytokines and pro-coagulant factors released by adipocytes in central fat, may underlie obesity's relationship to this cancer. Novel therapeutic agents that may antagonize adipo-cytokines and potentially offer a promising role in cancer therapy are discussed.","['Ryan, Aoife M', 'Duong, Michelle', 'Healy, Laura', 'Ryan, Stephen A', 'Parekh, Niyati', 'Reynolds, John V', 'Power, Derek G']","['Ryan AM', 'Duong M', 'Healy L', 'Ryan SA', 'Parekh N', 'Reynolds JV', 'Power DG']","['Department of Nutrition, Food Studies & Public Health, New York University, New York, NY 10044, USA. aoife.ryan1@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Syndrome/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Obesity/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Prospective Studies']",,,,,2011/04/08 06:00,2012/01/31 06:00,['2011/04/08 06:00'],"['2010/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(11)00049-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2011.03.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2011 Aug;35(4):309-19. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2011.03.001.

We discuss recent studies that employ lifestyle interventions to target improved asthma outcomes. Finally, we discuss the future direction of research in this area.

Concurrent with the rising prevalence of obesity is an epidemic of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimated 18 million U.S. adults currently affected. This review discusses the strong and consistent association between CKD risk and increasing body mass index noted in several observational studies. Potential mechanisms for obesity's role in the development and progression of CKD and secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis are also discussed. METHODS: Literature review. RESULTS: Although obesity is an important risk factor for diabetes and hypertension, the two most common etiologies of kidney failure, obesity itself may increase CKD risk by increasing the metabolic demands on the kidney, which leads to higher glomerular capillary pressures and glomerular hypertrophy. The hyperinsulinemia frequently linked with obesity may also accelerate structural damage by interacting with angiotensin II and increasing collagen production and deposition. The histologic changes in the kidney noted in some obese, especially morbidly obese, adults frequently mimic those changes associated with secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which may occur in disease states such as severely reduced nephron mass and hemodynamic stress. Given the presence of genetic susceptibility and/or reduced nephron mass, obesity may potentiate the development and progression of secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is an important risk factor for CKD. Treatment plans for obese adults with CKD should include weight loss and exercise because these interventions may simultaneously reduce the metabolic demands on the kidney, lower systemic and glomerular pressures, and improve insulin sensitivity. However, more studies are needed to further optimize the treatment and prevention of CKD associated with obesity.","['Kramer, Holly']",['Kramer H'],"['Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Ill., USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Contrib Nephrol,Contributions to nephrology,7513582,,IM,"['Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*epidemiology', 'Obesity/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,,2006/08/25 09:00,2006/10/19 09:00,['2006/08/25 09:00'],"['2006/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['000095315 [pii]', '10.1159/000095315 [doi]']",ppublish,Contrib Nephrol. 2006;151:1-18. doi: 10.1159/000095315.,,,,,,,97,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Appropriate trophoblast function is critical in establishing a normal pregnancy. Insufficient or impaired trophoblast invasion is associated with early miscarriage, fetal growth abnormalities, and preeclampsia. Thus, any negative impact obesity may impose on the trophoblast may represent a root cause for several adverse reproductive outcomes seen more commonly among obese women. While little is known about obesity's specific impact on the human trophoblast, in vitro studies and animal models provide insight.

In the United States, 27% of adults are obese and an additional 34% are overweight. Research in the past decade has shown that genetic influences clearly predispose some individuals to obesity.

Management of the obesity epidemic will require a two-pronged approach. First, better treatments, including behavioral, pharmacologic, and surgical interventions, are needed for individuals who are already obese. The second and potentially more promising approach is to prevent the development of obesity by tackling the toxic environment. This will require bold public policy initiatives such as regulating food advertising directed at children.

We sought to examine evidence concerning obesity's health-related risks, diagnostic methods, and treatment outcomes in older individuals. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases, consulted with experts, and examined bibliographies for English language studies discussing obesity in older adults (mean age > or = 60), published between January 1980 and November 2005. Inclusion criteria were met by 32 longitudinal analyses, seven diagnostic studies, and 17 randomized controlled trial articles. At least two authors independently reviewed and abstracted study design, population, results, and quality information. RESULTS: Correlations between body fat and three anthropometric measures (BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) decrease with age but remain clinically significant. Obesity contributes to risk for several cardiovascular endpoints, some cancers, and impaired mobility but protects against hip fracture. The association between obesity and mortality declines as age increases. Intensive counseling strategies incorporating behavioral, dietary, and exercise components promote a weight loss of 3 to 4 kg over 1 to 3.3 years. The loss is linked with improved glucose tolerance, improved physical functioning, reduced incidence of diabetes and a combined hypertension and cardiovascular endpoint, and reduced bone density. DISCUSSION: In older adults, obesity can be diagnosed with standard clinical measures. Intensive counseling can promote modest sustained weight loss, but data are insufficient to evaluate surgical or pharmacological options. Obesity treatment is most likely to benefit individuals with high cardiovascular risk. Limited data suggest possible functional improvement. Treatment should incorporate measures to avoid bone loss.","['McTigue, Kathleen M', 'Hess, Rachel', 'Ziouras, Jennifer']","['McTigue KM', 'Hess R', 'Ziouras J']","['Center for Research on Health Care, Division of General Internal Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA. mctiguekm@upmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Obesity (Silver Spring),"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",101264860,,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/metabolism', 'Aged', '*Anthropometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', '*Geriatrics', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Obesity/complications/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Weight Loss/*physiology']",,,,,2006/10/13 09:00,2007/01/17 09:00,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/9/1485 [pii]', '10.1038/oby.2006.171 [doi]']",ppublish,Obesity (Silver Spring). 2006 Sep;14(9):1485-97. doi: 10.1038/oby.2006.171.,,,,,,,116,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ""gold standard"" for body fat is the body density from which fat and fat-free body mass can be calculated. The new technique of bioelectric impedance analysis may substantially improve the estimation of total body fat. For estimating regional fat distribution, either waist to hip circumference ratio or subscapular skinfold have been most useful. Using the body mass index, defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kilogram per square meter), the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey estimated that 26%, or 34 million, adult Americans aged 20 to 75 were overweight. The prevalence of severe overweight (a body mass index above 30 kg/m2) is higher in the United States and Canada than in Great Britain, the Netherlands, or Australia. Obesity results from an increase in energy intake relative to expenditure. Total daily energy expenditure includes energy used during resting metabolism, energy associated with the ingestion of food, and energy needed for physical activity. The obese are often observed to be less active, but since carrying a heavier load requires more energy, their total energy expenditure may not be low. A low resting metabolic rate has been suggested as a predictor of future risk of becoming obese. Adipose tissue is the major site for fat storage and may contain more than 90% of total energy stores. The increase in body mass index or degree of body weight is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, gall bladder disease, and diabetes mellitus. When fat is centrally located in either males or females, the risk for these diseases is also increased, and may be a more important risk factor than total overweight itself. Genetic factors form the background from which obesity develops. The best estimates suggest that these genetic factors may be of less importance than environmental events in determination of total body fat and its distribution. Obesity can be classified on the basis of the total number of fat cells and regional fat distribution by using the etiological factors which caused the obesity or by determining the age at which the obesity began.

Populations experiencing poverty and, as a consequence, food insecurity in the United States are disproportionately affected by obesity, which was identified early in the pandemic as a major risk factor for increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and mortality. Given the focus on obesity and its role in immune dysregulation, it is also important to note the role of micronutrient deficiency, another sequalae of food insecurity. Micronutrients play an important role in the ability of the immune system to mount an appropriate response. Moreover, OBESE individuals are more likely to be micronutrient deficient. This review will explore the role of micronutrients, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin C, and zinc in respiratory immunity and COVID-19 and how micronutrient deficiency may be a possible confounder in obesity's association with severe outcomes. By illuminating the role of micronutrients in COVID-19, this paper expands the discussion from food insecurity and obesity to include micronutrient deficiency and how all of these interact in respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19.","['Chu, Brian A', 'Surampudi, Vijaya', 'Li, Zhaoping', 'Harris, Christina', 'Seeman, Teresa', 'Norris, Keith C', 'Vijayan, Tara']","['Chu BA', 'Surampudi V', 'Li Z', 'Harris C', 'Seeman T', 'Norris KC', 'Vijayan T']","['David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Center for Human Nutrition, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Department of Allergy and Immunology, Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Center for Human Nutrition, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Division of Geriatrics, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Division of General Internal Medicine-Health Services Research, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,"['0 (Micronutrients)', '0 (Vitamins)']",IM,"['*COVID-19', 'Humans', 'Micronutrients', 'Obesity/epidemiology', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Vitamins']",PMC8834257,['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'coronavirus', 'food insecurity', 'micronutrients', 'obesity', 'respiratory infection', 'vitamin A', 'vitamin D']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2022/02/16 06:00,2022/02/19 06:00,['2022/02/15 01:13'],"['2021/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2022/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2022/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/02/15 01:13 [entrez]', '2022/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph19031125 [pii]', 'ijerph-19-01125 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph19031125 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2022 Jan 20;19(3):1125. doi: 10.3390/ijerph19031125.,"['P30 AG021684/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001881/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",20220120,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0596-1842', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7105-065X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8662-4310']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is frequently ignored by the pediatrician or viewed as a form of social deviancy, and blame for treatment failure placed on the patients or their families. The definition of obesity is difficult. Using total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC) technology, total body fat ranges between 12% and 30% of total body weight in normal children and adolescents. This is influenced not only by age, but also by physical fitness. Anthropometry is the easiest way to define obesity. Children whose weight exceeds 120% of that expected for their height are considered overweight. Skinfold thickness and body mass index are indices of obesity that are more difficult to apply to the child. Childhood obesity is associated with obese parents, a higher socioeconomic status, increased parental education, small family size and a sedentary lifestyle. Genetics also clearly plays a role. Studies have demonstrated that obese and non-obese individuals have similar energy intakes implying that obesity results from very small imbalances of energy intake and expenditure. An excess intake of only 418 kJ per day can result in about 4.5 kg of excess weight gain per year. Small differences in basal metabolic rate or the thermic effects of food may also account for the difference in energy balance between the obese and non-obese. In the Prader Willi Syndrome, there appears to be a link between appetite and body fatness. When placed on growth hormone, lean body mass increases, body fat decreases, sometimes to normal, and appetite becomes more normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Klish, W J']",['Klish WJ'],"[""Department of Pediatric Nutrition and Gastroenterology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston 77030, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Acta Paediatr Jpn,Acta paediatrica Japonica : Overseas edition,0370357,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthropometry', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Female', 'Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Obesity/epidemiology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Texas', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1442-200x.1995.tb03675.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr Jpn. 1995 Feb;37(1):1-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-200x.1995.tb03675.x.,,,,,,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adipose tissue regulates multiple processes critical for energy homeostasis and its dysfunction favors the development and perpetuation of metabolic diseases. Obesity drives inflammatory leucocyte infiltration in adipose tissue and fibrotic transformation of the fat depots. Both features associate with metabolic alterations such as impaired glucose control and resistance to fat mass loss. In this context, adipose progenitors, an heterogenous resident population of mesenchymal stromal cells, display functions important to shape healthy or unhealthy adipose tissue expansion.

The purpose of the present paper is to provide some examples of the knowledge that is available in the field of obesity genetics, and also the new strategies being developed that are aimed at studying the relative contribution of numerous genes to obesity and their responses to environmental changes. In the rare cases of monogenic obesities in which a major gene is the cause the molecular approach has proved extremely powerful in the identification of the genes responsible and in defining new syndromes. However, in the common forms of obesity (polygenic obesity) most studies have analysed genotype-phenotype associations without sometimes taking into account the influence of environmental factors (diet, sedentary lifestyle). Among the aspects limiting this integrated approach to obesity are the difficulty of having large enough samples and the expansion of biocomputing tools developed for accessing the question of multiple interactions with no a priori hypotheses. This picture is rapidly changing. Large databases of clinical data and DNA and biological sample banks with more precise environmental information and patient phenotypes are being compiled. The capacity for studying multiple genes simultaneously at the DNA or RNA levels is also possible. Finally, the tremendous progress in biocomputing will allow the integration of these different types of data (relating to environment, phenotype, genotype, gene expression) and will improve the ability to deal with this complex disease.","['Clement, Karine']",['Clement K'],"['Inserm Avenir, Paris, EA3502 and Paris 6 University, Nutrition Department, Hotel-Dieu Hospital, France. karine.clement@htd.ap-hop-paris.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Proc Nutr Soc,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,7505881,,IM,"['*Environment', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Obesity/epidemiology/etiology/*genetics', 'Phenotype']",,,,,2005/06/18 09:00,2005/09/17 09:00,['2005/06/18 09:00'],"['2005/06/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1079/pns2005416 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Nutr Soc. 2005 May;64(2):133-42. doi: 10.1079/pns2005416.,,,,,,,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dietitians and nutritionists have long been involved in the treatment of obesity, and have a vital role to play in the battle to reverse the increasing prevalence of this major public health problem. However, the current management of obesity is far from ideal. There is evidence to suggest that in general health care, even when there are clearly effective clinical interventions, health professionals may not practise in the best way. Furthermore, some professionals may also hold negative attitudes towards the obese. These are the subject of a systematic review on improving health professionals' practice and organization of care in obesity treatment, the preliminary findings of which will be discussed in the present paper (Harvey et al. 1998a,b). A new approach to obesity is required, encompassing effective treatment and prevention strategies. A greater understanding of the problems faced by the obese individual in attempting to lose weight is also needed, with a range of treatment approaches on offer to acknowledge the heterogeneity of obesity. Those health professionals involved in obesity treatment must consider the impact of dietary advice given in a consultation against the impact of environmental cues that assail the patient as soon as they leave the room. Tackling the obesity epidemic requires action at the individual and population level if we are to see any reduction in prevalence.","['Kirk, S F']",['Kirk SF'],"['Division of Public Health, Nuffield Institute for Health, University of Leeds, UK. s.f.l.kirk@leeds.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Proc Nutr Soc,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,7505881,,IM,"['Adult', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Dietetics', 'Exercise', 'Humans', 'Obesity/complications/diet therapy/prevention & control/*therapy']",,,,,1999/05/27 00:00,1999/05/27 00:01,['1999/05/27 00:00'],"['1999/05/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1079/pns19990008 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Nutr Soc. 1999 Feb;58(1):53-8. doi: 10.1079/pns19990008.,,,,,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, upper airway surgeries for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common comorbidity among obese patients, may be complicated by obesity's impact on intraoperative ventilation. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the association of various degrees of obesity with postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for OSA. METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement database between 2015 and 2019 was used to create a sample of patients diagnosed with OSA who underwent uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, tracheotomy, and surgeries at the base of tongue, maxilla, palate, or nose/turbinate. Inverse probability-weighted logistic regression and unadjusted multivariable logistic regression were used to compare outcomes of non-obese and obesity class 1, class 2, and class 3 groups (World Health Organization classification). Primary outcome was a composite of 30-day readmissions, reoperations, and/or postoperative complications, and a secondary outcome was all-cause same-day hospital admission. RESULTS: There were 1929 airway surgeries identified. The inverse probability-weighted regression comparing class 1, class 2, and class 3 obesity groups to non-obese patients showed no association between obesity and composite outcome and no association between obesity and hospital admission (all p-values > 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results do not provide evidence that obesity is associated with poorer outcomes or hospital admission surrounding upper airway surgery for OSA. While these data points towards the safety of upper airway surgery in obese patients with OSA, larger prospective studies will aid in elucidating the impact of obesity.","['Du, Austin L', 'Tully, Jeffrey L', 'Curran, Brian P', 'Gabriel, Rodney A']","['Du AL', 'Tully JL', 'Curran BP', 'Gabriel RA']","['School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Division of Perioperative Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Division of Perioperative Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Biomedical Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Division of Perioperative Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Division of Perioperative Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Biomedical Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Humans', 'Obesity/complications', 'Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/etiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/complications/diagnosis/surgery']",PMC9371252,,,"['The University of California San Diego has received funding and product for other', 'research projects from Epimed International (Farmers Branch, TX); Infutronics', '(Natick, MA); and SPR Therapeutics (Cleveland, OH) for Dr. Gabriel.

Groups of obese subjects with a family history of obesity and/or a childhood onset of obesity have a reduced thermogenic response after glucose or meal ingestion. However, this defect in diet-induced thermogenesis is not a uniform finding, since only a third of an unselected group of obese women exhibit a reduced response. Moreover, obese subjects with reduced thermogenesis have a higher overall energy expenditure than lean people, even in situations in which a thermogenic response is produced. After inducing loss of weight with a hypocaloric diet, the thermogenic defect does not disappear. Since basal metabolic rate decreases with weight loss, the postprandial energy expenditure of some 'post-obese' subjects can be lower than that of lean controls. It is concluded that a thermogenic defect can contribute to the development of obesity in some predisposed subjects. The mechanisms of the thermogenic defect in the obese are presently unknown; insulin resistance and/or a blunted response of the sympathetic nervous system have been reported, but this topic remains controversial. After weight loss, energy expenditure decreases by about 84 kJ/24 h (20 kcal/24 h) per kg of weight loss in all patients. The need to reset energy intake to a lower level than the previous maintenance food consumption represents a major difficulty in the treatment of obesity; failure to adjust energy intake to the new requirements contributes to the frequent relapse of body weight gain in the obese after completion of a period on a hypocaloric diet.","['Jequier, E']",['Jequier E'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Clin Endocrinol Metab,Clinics in endocrinology and metabolism,0357424,,IM,"['Adult', 'Body Temperature Regulation', 'Body Weight', 'Eating', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*metabolism/physiopathology/therapy']",,,,,1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0300-595x(84)80038-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1984 Nov;13(3):563-80. doi: 10.1016/s0300-595x(84)80038-9.,,,,,,,78,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple scholarly disciplines have generated a significant body of literature on the workplace consequences of obesity. Strikingly, however, the applied psychology and management literatures-a natural home for such research-have largely ignored this topic while embracing related issues like health, wellness, disability, and others. This paper seeks to invigorate organizational research on obesity by collecting, cataloging, integrating, and extending the disparate research streams that have explored the workplace consequences of obesity. To do so, this paper reviews empirical and conceptual studies on the workplace consequences of obesity, identifies weaknesses limiting the field's growth and impact, and builds an integrative theoretical framework that addresses these weaknesses. In doing so, we extend the field's understanding of the processes leading to-and the boundary conditions related to-obesity's influence on work outcomes for employees. Specifically, we broaden the field's focus by looking beyond the psychological processes (primarily stigmatization) that underlie obesity effects to consider the impact of both economic and medical perspectives as well. In all, this review integrates the multidisciplinary obesity literature by challenging the view that obesity effects can be primarily understood through a stigma-based lens. In so doing, we offer contributions not just to the obesity literature, but to related areas of health and social categorizations as well, and hope to revitalize work on a serious issue facing today's organizations and the people who work in them.

This new knowledge will change the philosophy of the management of obesity. Obesity responds poorly to nonsurgical therapies. Its treatment must be long-term in spite of the considerable social and biological pressure that favor the regaining of weight. Treatment of the obese patient must be performed by a multidisciplinary team, and should include a hypoenergetic diet, exercise program, behavioral modifications, and in some instances, family therapy. The treatment of obesity should be tailored for each individual. Drug use in the treatment of obesity is not a substitute for modifying the individual's diet and physical activity.

Obesity frequently aggregates in families. However, this familial resemblance is caused not only by genetic effects but also by lifestyle, and environmental and cultural factors. Thus the genetic heritability of the obesity phenotypes accounts for up to 50% of the age- and gender-adjusted phenotypic variances. These results have been confirmed by overfeeding and negative energy balance studies. The effects of single segregating genes can be detected only under the correct experimental conditions. Most scientists in the area believe that these genes can be identified and that the DNA mutations associated with human obesities will be uncovered. Indeed, association and linkage studies, quantitative trait loci and positional cloning research strategies, and transgenic mouse models are sufficiently promising to suggest that these aims can be achieved. A review of the evidence reported thus far reveals that there are already four loci with strong evidence of linkage with obesity phenotypes in humans.","['Bouchard, C']",['Bouchard C'],"['Physical Activity Sciences Laboratory, Laval University, Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Ciba Found Symp,Ciba Foundation symposium,0356636,,IM,"['Animals', 'Body Mass Index', 'Family', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Hyperphagia/complications', 'Obesity/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/9780470514962.ch7 [doi]'],ppublish,"Ciba Found Symp. 1996;201:108-15; discussion 115-7, 188-93. doi: 10.1002/9780470514962.ch7.",,,,,,,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review we explore contemporary understandings of the relationship between obesity and the microbiome from a high-level ecological and functional perspective, along with a survey of recently proposed interventions. We highlight areas of consensus and areas for further study in the field.","['Al-Ghalith, Gabriel A', 'Vangay, Pajau', 'Knights, Dan']","['Al-Ghalith GA', 'Vangay P', 'Knights D']","['Biomedical Informatics and Computational Biology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Biomedical Informatics and Computational Biology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Biotechnology Institute and Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, MN 55108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Discov Med,Discovery medicine,101250006,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bacteria/classification', 'Gastrointestinal Tract/*microbiology/pathology', 'Humans', '*Microbiota', 'Obesity/*microbiology']",,,,,2015/03/01 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2015/03/01 06:00'],"['2015/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Discov Med. 2015 Feb;19(103):81-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How should obesity be determined at clinical examination? Is there an obesity epidemic? What is the likely influence of obesity upon current and future health? What are the causes of obesity, and what does this imply for prevention and treatment? DATA SOURCES: Relevant articles in Medline and personal files. DATA SYNTHESIS: The 80th and 95th percentiles of body mass index and skinfold readings provide the most commonly accepted indices of overweight and obesity in the child. Over the last 20 years, the proportions of overweight and obese children have increased in both indigenous populations and most developed societies. Current methods of assessing physical activity and diet during childhood lack the precision to establish the primary cause of the obesity epidemic, but correlational analysis shows a close relationship between body fat content and a decline in daily energy expenditures. Immediate consequences of childhood obesity include an increased prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques, hypertension, and an adverse lipid profile, with a poor self-image that limits participation in physical activity. Tracking is such that many obese children become obese adults, and in consequence, the long-term risks of cardiovascular and all-cause deaths are increased. The prevention of obesity is easier than its cure. A combination of increased lifestyle activities, less sedentary behavior, and dietary modification seems the most effective approach. This should be supported by the use of behavioral modification techniques and changes in the urban environment that encourage an active lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS: The pediatric physician can contribute to the control of obesity by monitoring body mass index and skinfold thicknesses in all patients. Children above the 50th percentile of body fat need dietary modification and a greater amount of moderate physical activity. Physicians should also advocate quality daily physical education and an environment that encourages adoption of an active lifestyle.","['Shephard, Roy J']",['Shephard RJ'],"['Faculty of Physical and Health Education, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. royjshep@shaw.ca']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin J Sport Med,Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine,9103300,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Obesity/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics/therapy', ""*Physician's Role"", 'Risk Reduction Behavior']",,,,,2004/05/29 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2004/05/29 05:00'],"['2004/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['00042752-200405000-00009 [pii]', '10.1097/00042752-200405000-00009 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin J Sport Med. 2004 May;14(3):161-8. doi: 10.1097/00042752-200405000-00009.,,,,,,,91,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attributing obesity to ""gluttony and sloth"", blaming the obese for overeating and limiting physical activity, oversimplifies a complex problem, since substantial differences in metabolic efficiency between lean and obese have been decisively demonstrated. The underlying physiological basis for these differences have remained poorly understood. The energetic requirements of homeothermy, the maintenance of a constant core temperature in the face of widely divergent external temperatures, accounts for a major portion of daily energy expenditure. Changes in body temperature are associated with significant changes in metabolic rate. These facts raise the interesting possibility that differences in core temperature may play a role in the pathophysiology of obesity. This review explores the hypothesis that lower body temperatures contribute to the enhanced metabolic efficiency of the obese state.","['Landsberg, Lewis', 'Young, James B', 'Leonard, William R', 'Linsenmeier, Robert A', 'Turek, Fred W']","['Landsberg L', 'Young JB', 'Leonard WR', 'Linsenmeier RA', 'Turek FW']","['Northwestern University Comprehensive Center on Obesity, Chicago, IL 60611, USA. l-landsberg@northwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Metabolism,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,0375267,,IM,"['Basal Metabolism', '*Body Temperature Regulation', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Humans', 'Obesity/etiology/*physiopathology']",,,,,2009/04/21 09:00,2009/06/11 09:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2008/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [medline]']","['S0026-0495(09)00085-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.metabol.2009.02.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Metabolism. 2009 Jun;58(6):871-6. doi: 10.1016/j.metabol.2009.02.017.,,,,,,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this paper is to present some examples of the knowledge acquired in the field of obesity genetics and the new ongoing tools and developments that aim at studying the contribution of genes to obesity and their response to environmental changes. MAIN POINTS: In rare cases of monogenic obesities, genetic tools have proved extremely powerful for identifying the genes responsible and for defining new syndromes. However, in common obesity, most studies include the search for genotype-phenotype associations without taking into account the influence of environment (diet, sedentary lifestyle) in the relationship. Among the limitations to this integrated approach, one can cite the difficulty of having large enough samples as well as biocomputing tools that are still in their infancy for accessing the question of multiple interactions with no ""a priori hypotheses"". This picture will probably change rapidly in the future. PERSPECTIVE: Large databases and DNA and biological sample banks will be available with updated environmental information and precise phenotypes thanks especially to European working groups. The capacity for studying multiple genes at once at the DNA or RNA levels is rapidly growing. Finally, tremendous progress in biocomputing will allow the integration of information from different sources (i.e. environment, phenotype, genotype, gene expression) and thus improve our ability to deal with complexity.","['Lubrano-Berthelier, C', 'Clement, K']","['Lubrano-Berthelier C', 'Clement K']","['Inserm Avenir, Paris EA3502, universite Pierre-et-Marie-Curie, Paris VI, France.']",['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Med Interne,La Revue de medecine interne,8101383,"['0 (Leptin)', '0 (Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leptin/blood/genetics/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Obesity/drug therapy/etiology/*genetics/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4/genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics', 'Receptors, Leptin', 'Risk', 'Syndrome']",,,,,2005/06/02 09:00,2005/12/20 09:00,['2005/06/02 09:00'],"['2005/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0248-8663(05)00167-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.revmed.2005.03.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Interne. 2005 Oct;26(10):802-11. doi: 10.1016/j.revmed.2005.03.017.,,,,,,,53,,Genetique de l'obesite humaine.,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a total of 21 lean and obese males (38-71 years) underwent a kidney biopsy. Biochemical analysis, histology, and endocannabinoid (eCB) assessment were performed on kidney tissue and blood samples. Correlations between different parameters were evaluated using a comprehensive matrix. The obese group exhibited kidney damage, reflected in morphological changes, and elevated kidney injury and fibrotic markers. While serum eCB levels were similar between the lean and obese groups, kidney eCB analysis revealed higher anandamide in obese patients. Obese individuals also exhibited reduced expression of cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R) in the kidney, along with increased activity of eCB synthesizing and degrading enzymes. Correlation analysis highlighted connections between renal eCBs, kidney injury markers, obesity, and related pathologies.

A constant neural, metabolic and hormonal ""conversation"" between the brain and periphery underlies the defense of a given level of adiposity. For the majority of humans, obesity becomes a permanent condition once it develops, possibly because of irreversible changes in the distributed network of specialized ""metabolic sensing"" neurons which regulate energy intake, expenditure and storage. Plasma leptin and insulin are catabolic hormones whose levels reflect the amount of adiposity and act as signal to metabolic sensing neurons. Obesity-prone individuals have an inborn reduction in their catabolic responses to glucose, leptin and insulin. These raised metabolic and hormonal sensing thresholds precede the development of obesity and predispose individuals to become and remain obese on energy dense diets. High fat diets exacerbate this problem by independently inhibiting central insulin and leptin signaling. In addition, intake of highly palatable diets overrides the homeostatic controls of ingestion because it is regulated by neural systems mediating reward and motivation. The genetic predisposition to become obese is accentuated in offspring of mothers who are obese or nutritionally deprived during gestation and/or lactation or by overfeeding during the early postnatal period. On the other hand, chronic stress and illness can both reduce adiposity, as does gastric bypass surgery. However, for chronic obesity treatment, both exercise and pharmacotherapy help but both must be continued chronically to provide sustained lowering of body weight in obese subjects.

Limited data exist examining obesity's influence on necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) disease course. METHODS: Retrospective review of prospectively maintained database of 571 adult necrotizing pancreatitis patients treated between 2007 and 2018. Patients were grouped according to body mass index (BMI) at disease onset. Patient characteristics, necrotizing pancreatitis course, and outcomes were compared between non-obese (BMI < 30) and obese (BMI > 30) patients. RESULTS: Among 536 patients with BMI data available, 304 (57%) were obese (BMI > 30), and 232 (43%) were non-obese (BMI < 30). NP etiology in the obese group was more commonly biliary (55% versus 46%, p = 0.04) or secondary to hypertriglyceridemia (10% versus 2%, p < 0.001) and less commonly alcohol (17% versus 26%, p = 0.01). Obese patients had a higher incidence of baseline comorbid disease. The CT severity index was similar between groups though obese patients had a higher rate of > 50% pancreatic gland necrosis (27% versus 19%, p = 0.02). The rates of infected necrosis and organ failure were higher among obese patients. Percutaneous drainage was more common in obese patients. Time to first necrosis intervention was earlier with increasing BMI. NP disease duration was longer in obese patients. The overall mortality rate of non-obese and obese patients did not differ. However, mortality rate increased with increasing BMI. CONCLUSION: Necrotizing pancreatitis in obese patients is characterized by a prolonged disease course, a higher risk of organ failure, infected necrosis, and the need for early necrosis-related intervention. Mortality increases with increasing BMI.","['McGuire, Sean P', 'Keller, Sydney L', 'Maatman, Thomas K', 'Lewellen, Kyle A', 'Ceppa, Eugene P', 'House, Michael G', 'Nakeeb, Attila', 'Nguyen, Trang K', 'Quigley, Stephen N', 'Schmidt, C Max', 'Zyromski, Nicholas J']","['McGuire SP', 'Keller SL', 'Maatman TK', 'Lewellen KA', 'Ceppa EP', 'House MG', 'Nakeeb A', 'Nguyen TK', 'Quigley SN', 'Schmidt CM', 'Zyromski NJ']","['Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine and Indiana University Health, 545 Barnhill Dr., Emerson Hall 519, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine and Indiana University Health, 545 Barnhill Dr., Emerson Hall 519, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine and Indiana University Health, 545 Barnhill Dr., Emerson Hall 519, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine and Indiana University Health, 545 Barnhill Dr., Emerson Hall 519, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine and Indiana University Health, 545 Barnhill Dr., Emerson Hall 519, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine and Indiana University Health, 545 Barnhill Dr., Emerson Hall 519, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine and Indiana University Health, 545 Barnhill Dr., Emerson Hall 519, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine and Indiana University Health, 545 Barnhill Dr., Emerson Hall 519, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Eastern Health, St. Johns, NL, Canada.', 'Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine and Indiana University Health, 545 Barnhill Dr., Emerson Hall 519, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine and Indiana University Health, 545 Barnhill Dr., Emerson Hall 519, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA. nzyromsk@iupui.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Gastrointest Surg,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,9706084,,IM,"['Adult', 'Disease Progression', 'Drainage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Necrosis/etiology', 'Obesity/complications', '*Pancreatitis, Acute Necrotizing/surgery/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,2022/08/13 06:00,2022/10/19 06:00,['2022/08/12 11:21'],"['2021/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2022/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/10/19 06:00 [medline]', '2022/08/12 11:21 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11605-022-05383-0 [pii]', '10.1007/s11605-022-05383-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Gastrointest Surg. 2022 Oct;26(10):2128-2135. doi: 10.1007/s11605-022-05383-0.

A multicenter, prospective, observational study conducted between September 2019 and December 2020 evaluated obesity's effects on sepsis outcomes in a national cohort. SETTING: Nineteen tertiary referral hospitals or university-affiliated hospitals in South Korea. PATIENTS: Adult patients with sepsis ( n = 6,424) were classified into obese ( n = 1,335) and nonobese groups ( n = 5,089). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Obese and nonobese patients were propensity score-matched in a ratio of 1:1. Inhospital mortality was the primary outcome. After propensity score matching, the nonobese group had higher hospital mortality than the obese group (25.3% vs 36.7%; p < 0.001). The obese group had a higher home discharge rate (70.3% vs 65.2%; p < 0.001) and lower median Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) (4 vs 5; p = 0.007) at discharge than the nonobese group, whereas the proportion of frail patients at discharge (CFS >/= 5) was significantly higher in the nonobese group (48.7% vs 54.7%; p = 0.011). Patients were divided into four groups according to the World Health Organization body mass index (BMI) classification and performed additional analyses. The adjusted odds ratio of hospital mortality and frailty at discharge for underweight, overweight, and obese patients relative to normal BMI was 1.25 ( p = 0.004), 0.58 ( p < 0.001), and 0.70 ( p = 0.047) and 1.53 ( p < 0.001), 0.80 ( p = 0.095), and 0.60 ( p = 0.022), respectively.

The purpose of this review was to investigate the roles of metabolic, body composition, and cardiovascular disease risk in subtypes of obesity. We briefly consider two subtypes of obesity that have been identified in the literature. One subset of individuals, termed the metabolically healthy, but obese (MHO), despite having large amounts of fat mass compared with at risk obese individuals shows a normal metabolic profile, but remarkably normal to high levels of insulin sensitivity. Preliminary evidence suggests that this could be due at least in part to lower visceral fat levels and earlier onset of obesity. A second subset, termed the metabolically obese, but normal weight (MONW), present with normal body mass index, but have significant risk factors for diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease, which could be due to higher fat mass and plasma triglycerides as well as higher visceral fat and liver content. We also briefly consider the potential role of adipose and gastrointestinal hormonal profiles in MHO and MONW individuals, which could lead to a better understanding of potential factors that may regulate their body composition. This information will eventually be invaluable in helping us understand factors that predispose to or protect obese individuals from metabolic and cardiovascular disease. Collectively, a greater understanding of the MHO and MONW individual has important implications for therapeutic decision making, the characterization of subjects in research protocols, and medical education.","['Karelis, Antony D', 'St-Pierre, David H', 'Conus, Florence', 'Rabasa-Lhoret, Remi', 'Poehlman, Eric T']","['Karelis AD', 'St-Pierre DH', 'Conus F', 'Rabasa-Lhoret R', 'Poehlman ET']","['Departement de Nutrition, Unite Metabolique, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1A8. antony.karelis@umontreal.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,,IM,"['Body Composition/*physiology', 'Energy Metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*metabolism/*physiopathology']",,,,,2004/06/08 05:00,2004/07/20 05:00,['2004/06/08 05:00'],"['2004/06/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['89/6/2569 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2004-0165 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2004 Jun;89(6):2569-75. doi: 10.1210/jc.2004-0165.,,,,,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with non-obese workers, obese workers miss more workdays due to illness, injury, or disability. Costs of premature mortality vary substantially across countries. The results for presenteeism and workers' compensation were mixed.

In this exploratory analysis, we examined the association of a broad array of state-level factors with the number and types of obesity policies across states. DESIGN: We analyzed 32 predictor variables across 7 categories of state-level characteristics. We abstracted data from 1652 state obesity policies introduced during 2009-2014. We used multilevel regression models and principal component analysis to examine the association between state-level characteristics and policy outcomes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Our outcome measures included whether bills involved topics that were public health-oriented or business interest-oriented, whether bills were enacted into law, and the number of introduced bills and enacted laws per state. RESULTS: Numerous state-level characteristics were associated with obesity-related bill introduction and law enactment, and different state characteristics were associated with public health-oriented versus business interest-oriented policies.

Clinical outcomes assessed include weight changes over time and the effects of weight loss on blood pressure, serum lipid profiles and blood glucose control. Quality of life and economic data have been incorporated where available. Double-blind, randomised controlled trials were used preferentially over shorter term open studies. The literature evaluation was based on a Medline search of published data between January 1990 and January 1998. Obesity affects 65 million adults in the US. Estimates based on 1990 data suggest that obesity and comorbid illness contributed to $US46 billion in direct costs and $US23 billion in indirect costs in the US. Obesity is a chronic condition which requires long term management. The risk of developing cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, Pickwickian syndrome and cancer is increased in the obese population, resulting in excess morbidity and mortality. There are no long term prospective studies that have demonstrated that weight reduction in obese patients improves survival. However, on the basis of epidemiological data using the prevalence of disease and associated body mass index, it is generally accepted that weight reduction of 5 to 10% in obese patients is associated with significant health benefits. Current treatment modalities include diet and behaviour modification, exercise and, where indicated, pharmacological intervention. Surgical intervention is reserved for the clinically severe obese patient [body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m2]. Many studies have demonstrated weight loss and improved metabolic fitness over 6 to 12 months. Few studies have been conducted over a longer period. Limited data are available regarding reduced morbidity and mortality, improved quality of life and functional or employment status and even fewer have incorporated any economic assessments of the impact of medical or surgical intervention. Although prospective data have demonstrated reduced morbidity following surgical intervention, only retrospective data have demonstrated reduced mortality. Studies of new drugs and interventions under development should demonstrate long term safety and efficacy in terms of sustained weight loss and subsequent weight maintenance. Future studies should incorporate assessment of patient perceived satisfaction with weight loss, health status and quality-of-life evaluations and pharmacoeconomic data to aid clinicians in the decision-making process in terms of weight management of their obese patients.","['Cerulli, J', 'Malone, M']","['Cerulli J', 'Malone M']","['Division of Pharmacy Practice, Albany College of Pharmacy, New York, USA. cerullij@panther.acp.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,,,"['Humans', 'Obesity/economics/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,1998/08/05 00:00,1998/08/05 00:01,['1998/08/05 00:00'],"['1998/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00019053-199814030-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 1998 Sep;14(3):269-83. doi: 10.2165/00019053-199814030-00004.,,,,,,,59,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growing evidence demonstrate that energy dense, palatable foods elicit similar responses in reward-related brain regions that mimic those of addictive substances. Currently, various models of obesity's relation to reward from food have been theorized. There is evidence to support a theory of hypo-responsivity of reward regions to food, where individuals consume excess amounts to overcome this reward deficit. There is also data to support a theory of hyper-responsivity of reward regions, where individuals who experience greater reward from food intake are at risk for overeating. However, these seemingly discordant theories are static in nature and do not account for the possible effects of repeated overeating on brain responsivity to food and initial vulnerability factors. Here we review data that support these theories and propose a dynamic vulnerability model of obesity that appears to offer a parsimonious theory that accommodates extant findings.","['Burger, Kyle S', 'Stice, Eric']","['Burger KS', 'Stice E']","['Oregon Research Institute, Eugene, OR 97401, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Abuse Rev,Current drug abuse reviews,101468123,,IM,"['Animals', 'Behavior, Addictive/physiopathology/psychology', 'Functional Neuroimaging/methods/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods/*psychology', 'Neural Pathways/physiopathology', 'Obesity/*physiopathology/*psychology', '*Reward']",PMC3462740,,,,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/04/17 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CDAR/E-Pub/000044 [pii]', '10.2174/1874473711104030182 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Abuse Rev. 2011 Sep;4(3):182-9. doi: 10.2174/1874473711104030182.,['R01 DK080760/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['NIHMS405209'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dietary studies, which represent an integral part of SOS research activities, are the focus of this review. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Due to the large number of obese subjects included in the SOS data bases ( > 5000), an early priority of the project was to develop a dietary assessment method which: (i) described usual intake patterns; (ii) could be self-administered by subjects and rapidly processed; and (iii) was equally valid in obese and non-obese individuals. RESULTS: The SOS method has met these requirements and is now being completed by all subjects at baseline and during the intervention, and by a non-obese reference population. A number of dietary features distinguishing obese subjects have emerged, including: elevated intakes of energy and energy-percent fat; low consumption of alcohol, fruits and vegetables; high dietary disinhibition; frequent consumption of light meals and snacks; and night eating. In the surgical intervention group, a relatively high consumption of sweet foods was associated with better weight loss and maintenance. CONCLUSIONS: The SOS method appears to be less susceptible to obesity-related under-reporting than traditional dietary methods, and if the distribution of foods and nutrients can be assumed to be as unbiased as the energy intakes, this method should make it possible to capture associations between diet and obesity-related diseases in the future.","['Lissner, L', 'Lindroos, A K', 'Sjostrom, L']","['Lissner L', 'Lindroos AK', 'Sjostrom L']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Clin Nutr,European journal of clinical nutrition,8804070,,IM,"['Energy Intake', 'Humans', 'Nutrition Assessment', '*Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Obesity/diet therapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Registries', 'Sweden', 'Weight Loss']",,,,,1998/06/18 00:00,1998/06/18 00:01,['1998/06/18 00:00'],"['1998/06/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.ejcn.1600567 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Nutr. 1998 May;52(5):316-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1600567.,,,,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decreasing physical activity, increasing sedentarity, quantitative and qualitative energy consumption unadapted to energy expenditure and to lipid oxidation capabilities, reinforced by psychological needs, are catching out the control of food intake, particularly since it is more efficient to defend against famine than to protect against plethora.

The clinical heterogeneity of obesity is patent and a careful phenotypic analysis is a prerequisite to design the management strategy. Obesity is a chronic situation that needs a long-term treatment. The goals of treatment cannot be longer reduced to weight loss only, which in addition should be realistic, i.e. moderate. Management strategies must be conceived on a long-term basis, focused on prevention of weight regain, multifaceted and individually tailored. A number of tools are available and the state of the art is to use them appropriately to avoid being counter productive. Obesity may be viewed as an adaptive symptom in subjects poorly prepared to cope with recent environmental changes, but it is also a disease due to its prevalence, the number of weight dependent comorbidities and its socio economic costs. A specific medical approach of obesity has still to be developed.","['Guy-Grand, B']",['Guy-Grand B'],"['Service de Nutrition, Hotel-Dieu, F-75181 Paris 04. bernard.guy-grand@htd.ap-hop-paris.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,Ann Endocrinol (Paris),Annales d'endocrinologie,0116744,,IM,"['Behavior Therapy', 'Diet', 'Digestive System Surgical Procedures', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', '*Obesity/complications/epidemiology/etiology/therapy']",,,,,2004/01/07 05:00,2004/03/06 05:00,['2004/01/07 05:00'],"['2004/01/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['MDOI-AE-11-2003-64-5-C2-0003-4266-101019-ART2 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Endocrinol (Paris). 2003 Nov;64(5 Pt 2):S7-15.,,,,,,,23,,De l'obesite aux obesites: des concepts aux pratiques.,,,,,,,,,,,

By contrast, animal studies of obesity in infection can prospectively compare obese versus nonobese controls. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of animal investigations to further examine obesity's survival effect in infection and sepsis. METHODS: Databases were searched for studies comparing survival in obese versus nonobese controls. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of animal investigations to further examine obesity's survival effect in infection and sepsis. Methods. Databases were searched for studies comparing survival in obese versus nonobese animals following bacteria, lipopolysaccharide, or influenza virus challenges. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies (761 obese and 603 control animals) met the inclusion criteria. Obesity reduced survival in 19 studies (11 significantly) and the odds ratio (95% CI) of survival (0.21(0.13, 0.35); I (2) = 64%, p < 0.01p < 0.01p < 0.01) but with high heterogeneity. Obesity reduced survival (1) consistently in both single-strain bacteria- and lipopolysaccharide-challenged studies (n = 6 studies, 0.21(0.13, 0.34); I (2) = 64%, p < 0.01p < 0.01) but with high heterogeneity.

This study aimed to examine the relationship between body mass index (BMI; 18.5-<25, 25-<30, 30-<35, >/=35 kg/m(2)) and prognostic risk at diagnosis, compare the concordance between prognostic risk assessed at diagnostic biopsy versus pathologic risk assessed at surgery across BMI categories, and investigate the association between obesity and prostate cancer recurrence and all-cause death. METHODS: We examined men enrolled in CaPSURE who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1995 and 2017. Multiple imputation methods were used to handle missing data and reported along with complete case findings. RESULTS: Participants (n = 5,200) were followed for a median of 4.5 years; 685 experienced recurrence. Obesity was associated with higher prognostic risk at time of diagnosis (OR(obese) = 1.5; OR(very obese) = 1.7) and upward reclassification of disease between biopsy and surgery, driven by change in tumor stage (OR(obese) = 1.3; OR(very obese) = 1.6). We observed an association between BMI and recurrence with adjustment for disease severity using diagnostic factors (HR(very obese) = 1.7); this association disappeared when adjusting for disease severity factors obtained at surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that residual confounding may partially explain the conflicting evidence regarding obesity's influence on prostate cancer progression. Assessing T-stage via digital rectal exam may be complicated in larger men, potentially affecting clinical treatment decisions. A strong association with all-cause mortality demonstrates healthier BMI at diagnosis may still improve overall survival. IMPACT: Patients with greater BMI are prone to more advanced disease at diagnosis and may be more likely to have their tumor stage underestimated at diagnosis.","['Langlais, Crystal S', 'Cowan, Janet E', 'Neuhaus, John', 'Kenfield, Stacey A', 'Van Blarigan, Erin L', 'Broering, Jeanette M', 'Cooperberg, Matthew R', 'Carroll, Peter', 'Chan, June M']","['Langlais CS', 'Cowan JE', 'Neuhaus J', 'Kenfield SA', 'Van Blarigan EL', 'Broering JM', 'Cooperberg MR', 'Carroll P', 'Chan JM']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California. crystal.langlais@ucsf.edu.', 'Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*diagnosis', 'Prostatectomy/*methods', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*etiology/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors']",PMC6825577,,,['Conflicts of Interest: The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest.'],2019/08/30 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2019/08/30 06:00'],"['2019/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['1055-9965.EPI-19-0488 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-0488 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2019 Nov;28(11):1917-1925. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-0488.

In order to actually capture all the polyhedral determinants of the diverse types of obesity, the granularity of the phenotypic information acquired must be expanded in the context of a personalized approach. Whilst the use of precision medicine has been successfully implemented in areas like cancer and other diseases, health care providers are more reluctant to embrace detailed phenotyping to guide diagnosis, treatment and prevention in obesity. Given its multiple complex layers, phenotyping necessarily needs to go beyond the multi-omics approach and incorporate all the diverse spheres that conform the reality of people living with obesity. Potential barriers, difficulties, roadblocks and opportunities together with their interaction in a syndemic context are analyzed. Plausible lacunae are also highlighted in addition to pointing to the need of redefining new conceptual frameworks. Therefore, this extraordinary collection of state-ofthe-art reviews provides useful information to both experienced clinicians and trainees as well as academics to steer clinical practice and research in the management of people living with obesity irrespective of practice setting or career stage.","['Portincasa, Piero', 'Fruhbeck, Gema']","['Portincasa P', 'Fruhbeck G']","['Department of Precision and Regenerative Medicine and Ionian Area (DiMePre-J), Clinica Medica ""A.

METHODS: A retrospective review of all falls, motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), and penetrating trauma patients admitted from January 2008 to December 2012 was performed. The outcomes evaluated included mortality, length of stay at hospital, and discharge disposition. Patients were grouped according to the body mass index (BMI) and stratified by injury severity scores. RESULTS: Two thousand one hundred ninety six patients were analyzed; 132 penetrating, 913 falls, and 1,151 MVCs. Penetrating traumas had no significant difference in outcomes. In falls, obese patients had a lower mortality (P = .035). In MVCs, obese patients had longer hospitalizations (P = .02), and mild and moderate MVC injuries were less likely to be discharged home (P = .032 and .003). Obese patients sustained fewer head injuries in falls and MVCs (P = .005 and .043, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In falls, a higher BMI may benefit patients. However, an increasing BMI is associated with a longer length of stay at hospital, and decreased likelihood of discharge to home.","['Osborne, Zachary', 'Rowitz, Blair', 'Moore, Henry', 'Oliphant, Uretz', 'Butler, JoAnn', 'Olson, Michelle', 'Aucar, John']","['Osborne Z', 'Rowitz B', 'Moore H', 'Oliphant U', 'Butler J', 'Olson M', 'Aucar J']","['Carle Foundation Hospital, IL, USA; University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, IL, USA.

Eleven animals (six females, five males), or 7% of the adult population surveyed, were defined as obese on the basis of morphometric indices of adiposity > 2 s.d. above the mean for adults in this colony. The age of the obese animals ranged from 9-16 years; obese males were older than females (average 14 vs. 12 years), but this difference was not significant. Mean body weights for obese males and females were 14.1 +/- 0.5 and 13.5 +/- 0.7 kg, respectively. There were no gender differences in either the incidence of obesity or measures of body fat. Serum concentrations of cholesterol and testosterone were not significantly different between obese and nonobese monkeys. Serum triglyceride levels were somewhat higher in obese animals, but this difference was not significant. Glucose clearance was within normal limits in both obese and age- and sex-matched non-obese monkeys (> 2% per min). Although increased adiposity was significantly correlated with fasting insulin and the insulin response to glucose loading, differences between obese and non-obese animals in these values did not achieve significance. The incidence of obesity ranged from 0-20% among the eleven matrilines studied, and several primary familial relationships were observed within the obese sample. Most obese females were from a high ranking matriline whereas only one of the obese males was high ranking at the time of the survey.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Schwartz, S M', 'Kemnitz, J W', 'Howard, C F Jr']","['Schwartz SM', 'Kemnitz JW', 'Howard CF Jr']","['Caribbean Primate Research Center, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan 00936.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord,International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,9313169,,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Body Constitution', 'Female', 'Glucose Tolerance Test', 'Macaca mulatta/*physiology', 'Male', 'Monkey Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Obesity/epidemiology/genetics/physiopathology/*veterinary', 'Puerto Rico/epidemiology', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment']",,,,,1993/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord. 1993 Jan;17(1):1-9.,"['AG-05838/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AG-07831/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-03640/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The World Health Organization defines obesity as a chronic disease. The percentage of obese persons is increasing worldwide. Many different treatment modalities are available. Long-term success rates are not convincing. RESEARCH FOCUS: Overweight and obesity should be treated in an interdisciplinary and multimodal approach. The best results in loosing body weight, especially body fat use very low calorie diets followed by a fat-reduced, carbohydrate-rich diets. Weight-loss drugs should be used only in a weight-loss program including diet and physical activity. Surgical intervention is necessary in a small group of persons refractory to conservative obesity treatment.

However, the inter-person spreading dynamics of obesity are seldom studied. A distinguishing feature of the obesity epidemic is that it is driven by a social contagion process which cannot be perfectly described by the infectious disease models. In this paper, we propose a novel belief decision model based on the famous Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence to model obesity epidemic as the competing spread of two obesity-related behaviors: physical inactivity and physical activity. The transition of health states is described by an SIS model. Results reveal the existence of obesity epidemic threshold, above which obesity is quickly eradicated. When increasing the fading level of information spread, enlarging the clustering of initial obese seeds, or introducing small-world characteristics into the network topology, the threshold is easily met. Social discrimination against the obese people plays completely different roles in two cases: on one hand, when obesity cannot be eradicated, social discrimination can reduce the number of obese people; on the other hand, when obesity is eradicable, social discrimination may instead cause it breaking out.","['Huang, He', 'Yan, Zhijun', 'Chen, Yahong', 'Liu, Fangyan']","['Huang H', 'Yan Z', 'Chen Y', 'Liu F']","['School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China.', 'School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China.', 'School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China.', 'School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,IM,"['Exercise/psychology', 'Humans', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Obesity/*epidemiology/etiology/*psychology', 'Social Discrimination', 'Social Environment']",PMC5124998,,,,2016/11/29 06:00,2018/07/11 06:00,['2016/11/29 06:00'],"['2016/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/11 06:00 [medline]']","['srep37961 [pii]', '10.1038/srep37961 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Nov 28;6:37961. doi: 10.1038/srep37961.,,20161128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fortunately, infancy is a period of great behavioral and metabolic plasticity offering numerous targets for preventive interventions. Modifiable factors that may affect early rapid weight gain and obesity risk include infant sleep duration, feeding to soothe infant distress, and the introduction of solid foods and transitional feeding. We discuss evidence linking these factors to weight outcomes, as well as results from behavioral obesity interventions in infancy, from our laboratory and others'. For example, in a recent pilot intervention, we focused on helping new mothers address three areas of infant behavior hypothesized to affect weight gain and early obesity risk: infant sleeping, crying, and feeding. First-time mothers were randomly assigned to receive either a Soothe/Sleep intervention, an Introduction of Solids intervention, both interventions, or no interventions. The interventions were delivered via home visits and showed positive effects on infant behaviors and weight outcomes at 1 year. Based on evidence from such pilot interventions, we assess the plausibility of targeting behavioral factors in infancy and suggest next steps for early prevention research.","['Birch, Leann L', 'Anzman-Frasca, Stephanie', 'Paul, Ian M']","['Birch LL', 'Anzman-Frasca S', 'Paul IM']","['Center for Childhood Obesity Research, Noll Laboratory, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, Hershey, PA 16802, USA. llb15@psu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Switzerland,Nestle Nutr Inst Workshop Ser,Nestle Nutrition Institute workshop series,101577268,,IM,"['*Feeding Behavior', 'Female', '*Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Care/*methods', 'Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Male', 'Obesity/*epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Pilot Projects', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Sleep/physiology', 'Weight Gain/physiology']",,,,,2012/11/07 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['000341300 [pii]', '10.1159/000341300 [doi]']",ppublish,Nestle Nutr Inst Workshop Ser. 2012;73:81-94. doi: 10.1159/000341300.

Obesity's influence on circulating hormones and cytokines and bone mineralization ultimately influences the body's osteogenic response and bone mineralization, potentially increasing the risk of fracture and impacting fracture healing. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Does obesity delay fracture recovery in overweight or obese children as measured by the time to release to normal activity? Is this average time for return to activity influenced by the mechanism of the injury? Does obesity's effect on mineralization and loading in overweight or obese children lead to a greater proportion of upper extremity fracture versus lower extremity fracture? METHODS: We prospectively followed 273 patients with nonpathologic long bone fractures treated from January 2010 to October 2011. Patients were stratified into obese/overweight, normal weight, and underweight groups. All patients were followed until release to regular activities (mean, 41 days; range, 13-100 days). RESULTS: Release to regular activities occurred sooner in obese/overweight than in normal weight patients: 39 and 42 days, respectively. A greater proportion of obese/overweight patients had low to moderate energy mechanisms of injury than did normal weight patients, but we found no difference between the groups in terms of return to activity when stratified by mechanism. There was also no difference in the proportion of upper extremity injuries between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Obese/overweight children did not have a delay in release to activities compared with children of normal weight. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

A number of studies found a negative prognosis effect of obesity or excess of weight in woman breast cancer. However, to date, this issue remains controversial. The objectives of this study were to confirm the prognosis role of obesity on a large cohort of patients and to investigate a potential independent effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constituted a cohort of 14,709 patients who were recruited and treated at the Curie Institute (Paris) from 1981 to 1999. These patients were followed prospectively for a first unilateral invasive breast cancer without distant metastasis. Obesity was defined by a Body Mass Index (BMI) above 30 kg/m(2) according to the World Health Organization recommendations. RESULTS: Obese patients (8%) presented more extended tumors at diagnosis time suggesting a delayed breast cancer diagnosis. However, obesity appeared as a negative prognosis factor for several events in respectively univariate and multivariate survival analysis: metastasis recurrence (HR = 1.32[1.19-1.48]; HR = 1.12[1.00-1.26]), disease free interval (1.20[1.08-1.32]; 1.10[0.99-1.22]), overall survival (1.43[1.28-1.60]; 1.12[0.99-1.25]) and second primary cancer outcome (1.57[1.19-2.07]; 1.43[1.09-1.89]). Even if obese patients presented more advanced tumors at diagnosis time, multivariate analysis showed that there was a relevant independent effect. Other BMI codings, distinguishing overweight patients or using BMI as a continuous variable, showed a consistent correlation between BMI's value and prognosis effect. Interaction analysis revealed a more important obesity effect in the presence of tumor estrogen receptors and among limited extent tumors. CONCLUSIONS: This survey confirms the prognosis role of obesity on one of the largest cohort by investigating several prognosis events. While independent obesity effect linked to hormonal disorders appeared consistent as obesity's mechanism, we stress that obesity prognosis effect was also related to breast cancer presentation at diagnosis time.","['Majed, Bilal', 'Moreau, Thierry', 'Senouci, Kamel', 'Salmon, Remi J', 'Fourquet, Alain', 'Asselain, Bernard']","['Majed B', 'Moreau T', 'Senouci K', 'Salmon RJ', 'Fourquet A', 'Asselain B']","['Biostatistics Department, Curie Institute, 75005, Paris, France. bmajed@free.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Breast Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*complications', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies']",,,,,2007/10/17 09:00,2008/10/15 09:00,['2007/10/17 09:00'],"['2007/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10549-007-9785-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2008 Sep;111(2):329-42. doi: 10.1007/s10549-007-9785-3.

Obesity's impact on hospice and palliative care in patients with ESLD is unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated patients admitted to an academic, Midwestern, tertiary center between January 2016 and May 2019 with a diagnosis of ESLD. Body Mass Index and MELD Na were calculated for each patient's first admission during the study period. Patients with MELD Na scores >/= 21 or 18-20 with additional criteria were considered potentially eligible for hospice and palliative care referrals. RESULTS: Of 3863 patients admitted with ESLD, 1556 (40%) were potentially eligible for hospice and palliative care referrals. Of these, 703 (45%) were obese. Comorbidity burden was higher in obese patients (15.6% of obese patients had a Charlson Comorbidity Index >/= 5, while 5% of non-obese patients had a comorbidity index of >/= 5 (p < 0.001). Referral rates to hospice and palliative services in obese patients were 10.1% and 16.4% respectively. Hospice and palliative referral rates among non-obese patients were similar (10.1% and 15.5%). Among patients who died within 6 months of the first hospitalization, the mean time to referral to hospice or palliative care from index admission was longer in obese patients. CONCLUSION: Obesity is common in patients hospitalized with ESLD who may be approaching the end of life. Referral rates to hospice and palliative care services are low and similar regardless of BMI and despite higher co-morbidity burdens in obese patients. Obesity may delay referrals to hospice and palliative care.","['Subramoney, Kavitha', 'Orman, Eric', 'Johnson, Amy W', 'Kara, Areeba']","['Subramoney K', 'Orman E', 'Johnson AW', 'Kara A']","['10668Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', '10668Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', '10668Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', '10668Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",United States,Am J Hosp Palliat Care,The American journal of hospice & palliative care,9008229,,IM,"['*End Stage Liver Disease', '*Hospice Care', 'Humans', 'Obesity/complications/epidemiology', 'Palliative Care', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Terminal Care']",,['NOTNLM'],"['body mass index', 'end stage liver disease', 'hospice', 'obesity', 'palliative care']",,2020/12/08 06:00,2021/08/21 06:00,['2020/12/07 05:21'],"['2020/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/07 05:21 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1049909120978768 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hosp Palliat Care. 2021 Oct;38(10):1177-1181. doi: 10.1177/1049909120978768.

Using a murine model of obesity-driven TNBC, we compared the antitumor effects of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) with LFD, chronic CR, and intermittent CR. Each intervention generated weight and fat loss and suppressed tumor growth relative to obese mice (greatest suppression with CR).

Research to-date has been limited by the lack of prospective studies. METHODS: A longitudinal study design. At baseline, obese patients attending weight-management clinics (n=104) completed a questionnaire that assessed knowledge and beliefs regarding obesity's health and social/aesthetic consequences (Obesity Risk Knowledge (ORK-10) scale and the Obesity Beliefs scale), self-reported weight/height, goal weight, health-related quality of life, and sociodemographic characteristics. Medical records were also reviewed. At the 12-month follow-up, a second questionnaire assessed self-reported weight/height. RESULTS: At baseline, average ORK-10 scale scores were 4/10. At follow-up, 32 out of the 66 participants retained on the study did not gain weight (48.5%). For these participants, weight loss was associated with endorsement of the health (r(s)=0.40) and the social/aesthetic (r(s)=0.31) costs of obesity (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Despite their high-risk status, participants demonstrated low levels of knowledge regarding obesity's health risks. Weight loss was associated with greater awareness of the health and social/aesthetic costs of obesity. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This study suggests that health education is required to facilitate informed choices and supports the use of cognitive approaches which promote both the health and social/aesthetic consequences of obesity.","['Swift, Judy Anne', 'Glazebrook, Cris', 'Anness, Abigail', 'Goddard, Rebecca']","['Swift JA', 'Glazebrook C', 'Anness A', 'Goddard R']","['Division of Nutritional Sciences, School of Biosciences, The University of Nottingham, UK. judy.swift@nottingham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Patient Educ Couns,Patient education and counseling,8406280,,,"['Adult', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', '*Attitude to Health', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cost of Illness', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/complications/prevention & control/*psychology', 'Patient Education as Topic/*organization & administration', 'Quality of Life/psychology', 'Risk Factors', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United Kingdom', 'Weight Loss']",,,,,2008/09/23 09:00,2009/04/04 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2007/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0738-3991(08)00395-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pec.2008.07.045 [doi]']",ppublish,Patient Educ Couns. 2009 Jan;74(1):70-6. doi: 10.1016/j.pec.2008.07.045.

This study examined the association between obesity and surgical outcomes across a broad surgical population using a very large sample size. METHODS: This was an analysis of the 2012 to 2018 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement database, including all patients from 9 surgical specialties (general, gynecology, neurosurgery, orthopedics, otolaryngology, plastics, thoracic, urology, and vascular). Preoperative characteristics and postoperative outcomes were compared by body mass index class (normal weight 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2), overweight 25.0-29.9, obese class I 30.0-34.9, obese II 35.0-39.9, obese III >/=40). Adjusted odds ratios were computed for adverse outcomes by body mass index class. RESULTS: A total of 5,572,019 patients were included; 44.6% were obese. Median operative times were marginally higher for obese patients (89 vs 83 minutes, P < .001). Compared to normal weight patients, overweight and obese patients in classes I, II, and III all had higher adjusted odds of developing infection, venous thromboembolism, and renal complications, but they did not exhibit elevated odds of other postoperative complications (mortality, overall morbidity, pulmonary, urinary tract infection, cardiac, bleeding, stroke, unplanned readmission, or discharge not home (except for class III patients). CONCLUSION: Obesity was associated with increased odds of postoperative infection, venous thromboembolism, and renal but not the other American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement complications. Obese patients need to be carefully managed for these complications.","['Madsen, Helen J', 'Gillette, Riley A', 'Colborn, Kathryn L', 'Henderson, William G', 'Dyas, Adam R', 'Bronsert, Michael R', 'Lambert-Kerzner, Anne', 'Meguid, Robert A']","['Madsen HJ', 'Gillette RA', 'Colborn KL', 'Henderson WG', 'Dyas AR', 'Bronsert MR', 'Lambert-Kerzner A', 'Meguid RA']","['Surgical Outcomes and Applied Research Program, Department of Surgery, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.

METHODS: In an exploratory study, we retrospectively analyzed 771 datasets collected in 2019 as part of the standard documentation of acute psychosomatic hospitalizations. RESULTS: In 2019, the Medical Service audited bills for psychosomatic hospital - izations much more often in obese than in non-obese patients (odds ratio [OR] 2.499; 95% confidence interval [1.69; 3.69]). This was accounted for by a very high audit rate for patients with a secondary diagnosis of grade 3 obesity (OR = 3.972 [2.30; 6.86]). The audit categories ""quality of coding"" and ""possible incorrect admission"" were examined. CONCLUSION: Treatments of markedly obese inpatients that incurred greater expenses presumably led to a higher hospitalization audit rate as an automatic consequence of the auditing algorithms used. An unintentional statistical discrimination arose from the unjustified linkage of the audit category ""quality of coding"" of the secondary diagnosis (obesity) with the audit category ""possible incorrect admission"" with regard to the main diagnosis. Similar effects may be occurring with economically relevant secondary diagnoses in other areas of medicine as well.","['Imgart, Hartmut', 'Haase, Ingo']","['Imgart H', 'Haase I']","['Parkland Clinic, Clinic for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Bad Wildungen.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,,IM,"['Humans', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Hospitalization', '*Obesity/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Inpatients', 'Medical Audit']",PMC9811546,,,,2022/09/09 06:00,2023/01/05 06:00,['2022/09/08 03:52'],"['2022/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2022/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2022/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2022/09/08 03:52 [entrez]']","['arztebl.m2022.0256 [pii]', '10.3238/arztebl.m2022.0256 [doi]']",ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2022 Sep 30;119(39):658-663. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.m2022.0256.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the same time, parental perception of child weight represents an even more important tool. It is known that more than half of parents of overweight/obese children underestimate their child's weight status or are not worried about the risks associated with childhood overweight/obesity. Consequently, parental perception of childhood obesity can often be erroneous, and, even when accurate, subsequent parental behaviors can inadvertently contribute to the onset or persistence of childhood and adult obesity. Starting from the evidence that targeting a parent to induce a behavioral change is more effective than targeting the child only without parental participation, parental perceptions of childhood obesity can therefore represent a very important tool to take into consideration to achieve improvements in the context of childhood obesity. Therefore, knowledge of parental perception of children's weight status is needed to help pediatricians to organize and adapt activities and programs that promote healthy weight management among children. Specifically, early assessments of parents' perceptions of a child's weight, followed by regular follow-up visits, appropriate feedback, continuing education efforts, and efforts to follow the child's weight status over time, can be potentially very helpful.","['Puma, Andrea', 'Pecoraro, Luca', 'Salvottini, Chiara', 'Carbonare, Luca Dalle', 'Piacentini, Giorgio', 'Pietrobelli, Angelo']","['Puma A', 'Pecoraro L', 'Salvottini C', 'Carbonare LD', 'Piacentini G', 'Pietrobelli A']","['Department of Surgical Sciences, Pediatric Unit, Dentistry, Gynecology and Pediatrics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical Sciences, Pediatric Unit, Dentistry, Gynecology and Pediatrics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical Sciences, Pediatric Unit, Dentistry, Gynecology and Pediatrics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical Sciences, Pediatric Unit, Dentistry, Gynecology and Pediatrics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical Sciences, Pediatric Unit, Dentistry, Gynecology and Pediatrics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, LA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United Arab Emirates,Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",101269157,,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Child', '*Pediatric Obesity/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Body Mass Index', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Parents', 'Overweight', 'Body Weight', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BMI', 'Pediatric obesity', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'childhood obesity', 'diabetes', 'long-term consequences of pediatric-obesity', 'parental perceptions of pediatric obesity', 'short-term consequences of pediatric obesity']",,2022/06/01 06:00,2023/09/15 06:43,['2022/05/31 15:01'],"['2022/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2022/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2022/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/09/15 06:43 [medline]', '2022/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/31 15:01 [entrez]']","['EMIDDT-EPUB-124060 [pii]', '10.2174/1871530322666220530121012 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets. 2023;23(11):1380-1391. doi: 10.2174/1871530322666220530121012.,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8056-4487', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9765-8006', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8863-2605', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3263-6671', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1324-4373', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9912-3232']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dysfunctional adipose tissue is initially stored in the visceral depot, overflowing subsequently to produce lipotoxicity in ectopic depots like liver, heart, muscle, and pancreas, among others. People living with obesity need a diagnostic approach that considers an exhaustive pathophysiology and complications assessment. Thus, it is essential to warrant a holistic diagnosis and management that guarantees an adequate health status, and quality of life.

The aim of this study was to examine the impact of obesity on nocturnal hypoxia. METHODS: Twenty two thousand seven hundred and ninety three patients aged 21-80 years who underwent whole night polysomnography during 2000-2009 were included in the study. For each patient, percent sleep time spent with oxyhemoglobin desaturation lower than 90% was calculated (%NODP). Nocturnal hypoxia was analyzed by gender, age, OSAS severity, and body mass index (BMI) categories. RESULTS: Nocturnal hypoxia was positively correlated with BMI, OSAS severity, and age, but not with gender. The differences in %NODP between the two obese groups and non-obese varied from 0.55% to more than a 20% increase and were correlated with age and OSAS severity. The %NODP ratio between the two obese groups and the non-obese was independent of age and OSAS severity. There was a nearly twofold increase in %NODP in obese patients and a threefold increase in the morbidly obese relative to the non-obese. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that obesity plays an independent worsening modifying effect on nocturnal hypoxia in OSAS.","['Gabbay, Itay E', 'Gabbay, Uri', 'Lavie, Peretz']","['Gabbay IE', 'Gabbay U', 'Lavie P']","['Lloyd Rigler Sleep Apnea Laboratory, Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. igabbay@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Sleep Med,Sleep medicine,100898759,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*complications/physiopathology', 'Polysomnography', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Factors', 'Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/*complications/physiopathology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/08/25 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S1389-9457(12)00061-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.sleep.2012.01.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Sleep Med. 2012 May;13(5):524-8. doi: 10.1016/j.sleep.2012.01.005.

This history illuminates past consequences of framing obesity as an addiction in ways that may inform constructive policy responses today. METHODS: Review of secondary and primary sources, including archival documents, relating to obesity in biomedical and popular thought of the 1940s and 1950s. RESULTS: In the United States in the late 1940s and 1950s, new medical thinking about obesity reinterpreted overweight and obesity as chiefly the consequence of addiction (understood in the then dominant psychodynamic theory as a psychological defect, oral fixation). This new conception was rapidly taken up in popular discourse and clinical practice, with adverse effects through amplification of weight stigma. Further, in the conservative political context, the addiction concept contributed to an ineffective policy response to the alarming new epidemiological evidence about obesity's consequences. Despite a lack of evidence for efficacy of the intervention, public health efforts focused on correcting individual eating behaviour among obese people by encouraging self-help in lay groups modelled, in part, on Alcoholics Anonymous. Population-level intervention was neglected. CONCLUSIONS: Current public health policy initiatives must be mindful of the risks of reframing obesity as an addiction. These include inadvertently reinforcing stigma, narrowing responses to those aiming to modify individual behaviour and biology and neglecting population policies aiming to reduce the consumption of energy-dense foods, as all occurred in the 1950s United States.","['Rasmussen, Nicolas']",['Rasmussen N'],"['School of Humanities and Languages, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Addiction,"Addiction (Abingdon, England)",9304118,,IM,"['Attitude to Health', 'Drug Industry/history', 'Female', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Newspapers as Topic/history', 'Obesity/*history/psychology', 'Public Health/history', 'Public Opinion/history', 'Self-Help Groups/history', '*Social Stigma', 'Substance-Related Disorders/*history/psychology', 'United States']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Addiction', 'Bruch Hilde', 'David', 'Rutstein', 'chronic disease', 'epidemiology', 'history-United States', 'obesity', 'stigma']",,2014/10/22 06:00,2016/11/08 06:00,['2014/10/22 06:00'],"['2014/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/add.12774 [doi]'],ppublish,Addiction. 2015 Feb;110(2):217-25. doi: 10.1111/add.12774.

In the face of obesity's growing prevalence, it is important for physicians to be aware of emerging research of novel mechanisms through which adiposity adversely affects the heart. Conventional wisdom suggests that either hemodynamic (that is, increased cardiac output and hypertension) or metabolic (that is, dyslipidemic) derangements associated with obesity may predispose individuals to coronary artery disease and heart failure. The purpose of this review is to highlight a novel mechanism for heart disease in obesity whereby excessive lipid accumulation within the myocardium is directly cardiotoxic and causes left ventricular remodeling and dilated cardiomyopathy. Studies in animal models of obesity reveal that intracellular accumulation of triglyceride renders organs dysfunctional, which leads to several well-recognized clinical syndromes related to obesity (including type 2 diabetes). In these rodent models, excessive lipid accumulation in the myocardium causes left ventricular hypertrophy and nonischemic, dilated cardiomyopathy. Novel magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques are now available to quantify intracellular lipid content in the myocardium and various other human tissues, which has made it possible to translate these studies into a clinical setting. By using this technology, we have recently begun to study the role of myocardial steatosis in the development of obesity-specific cardiomyopathy in humans. Recent studies in healthy individuals and patients with heart failure reveal that myocardial lipid content increases with the degree of adiposity and may contribute to the adverse structural and functional cardiac adaptations seen in obese persons. These studies parallel the observations in obese animals and provide evidence that myocardial lipid content may be a biomarker and putative therapeutic target for cardiac disease in obese patients.","['McGavock, Jonathan M', 'Victor, Ronald G', 'Unger, Roger H', 'Szczepaniak, Lidia S']","['McGavock JM', 'Victor RG', 'Unger RH', 'Szczepaniak LS']","['University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390-8899, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/*etiology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular/*etiology/metabolism', '*Lipid Metabolism', 'Myocardium/*metabolism', 'Obesity/*complications/*metabolism']",,,,,2006/04/06 09:00,2006/04/25 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['144/7/517 [pii]', '10.7326/0003-4819-144-7-200604040-00011 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 2006 Apr 4;144(7):517-24. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-144-7-200604040-00011.,"['K-25 HL-68736/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01-RR00633/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,43,"['Ann Intern Med. 2006 Oct 3;145(7):553-4; author reply 555.

It is one of the most frequent consultations in general pediatrics and is even more common in pediatric endocrinology. As might be predicted, the prevalence of obesity-associated comorbidities is also increasing in children and adolescents. It is widely accepted that this increase in obesity results from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure, with an increase in positive energy balance being closely associated with the current lifestyle in Western countries. However, there is increasing evidence indicating that an individual's genetic background is important in determining obesity risk. The physiologic mechanisms controlling appetite and energy expenditure are being revealed in part because of the identification of new causes of human monogenic, syndromic, and endocrine-related obesity. Thus, it is no longer appropriate to talk about obesity, but rather about ""obesities"" or ""different diseases causing obesity,"" because their pathophysiologic bases differ. Moreover, these obesities require different diagnostic and management approaches. The pediatrician must be aware of this issue and focus the clinical history and physical examination toward specific clinical signs and symptoms to better exploit the available diagnostic and therapeutic resources when facing a child with obesity. Genetic, genomic, and metabolomic studies are often necessary to obtain a more appropriate diagnosis. Cognitive behavioral therapy is fundamental in obese children. The identification of potential targets will hopefully result in new pharmacologic approaches for translational and personalized medicine for obesity in the near future.","['Martos-Moreno, Gabriel A', 'Barrios, Vicente', 'Munoz-Calvo, Maria T', 'Pozo, Jesus', 'Chowen, Julie A', 'Argente, Jesus']","['Martos-Moreno GA', 'Barrios V', 'Munoz-Calvo MT', 'Pozo J', 'Chowen JA', 'Argente J']","['Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Endocrinology, Hospital Infantil Universitario Nino Jesus; Instituto de Investigacion La Princesa; Department of Pediatrics, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid; CIBER Fisiopatologia Obesidad y Nutricion; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Endocrinology, Hospital Infantil Universitario Nino Jesus; Instituto de Investigacion La Princesa; Department of Pediatrics, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid; CIBER Fisiopatologia Obesidad y Nutricion; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Endocrinology, Hospital Infantil Universitario Nino Jesus; Instituto de Investigacion La Princesa; Department of Pediatrics, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid; CIBER Fisiopatologia Obesidad y Nutricion; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Endocrinology, Hospital Infantil Universitario Nino Jesus; Instituto de Investigacion La Princesa; Department of Pediatrics, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid; CIBER Fisiopatologia Obesidad y Nutricion; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Endocrinology, Hospital Infantil Universitario Nino Jesus; Instituto de Investigacion La Princesa; Department of Pediatrics, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid; CIBER Fisiopatologia Obesidad y Nutricion; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Endocrinology, Hospital Infantil Universitario Nino Jesus; Instituto de Investigacion La Princesa; Department of Pediatrics, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid; CIBER Fisiopatologia Obesidad y Nutricion; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain argentefen@terra.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Adv Nutr,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",101540874,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Appetite', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Comorbidity', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Energy Intake', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Life Style', 'Metabolic Syndrome/diagnosis/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Pediatric Obesity/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors']",PMC4013186,,,"['Author disclosures: G.

AIMS: In this study, our aim was to evaluate the levels of oxidative stress markers and the FF viscosity in obese and non-obese patients. METHODS: Eighty norm-responder patients undergoing IVF were prospectively grouped according to their body mass indexes (BMI). Group 1 (n = 40) and group 2 (n = 40) had BMI values of </=24.9 and >/=25.0, respectively. Total sulfhydryl (RSH) levels (nmol/m) and the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (malondialdehyde, or MDA) (micromol/ml) in FFs were quantified. For the first time in our study, FF viscosity with changing BMI values was also determined. RESULTS: The mean levels of MDA (micromol/ml) and RSH (nmol/ml) were not significantly different between groups (1.37 +/- 0.51; 1.51 +/- 0.51; p > 0.05 for MDA and 0.42 +/- 0.30; 0.41 +/- 0.20; p > 0.05 for RSH, respectively). Similarly, the FF viscosity (centipoise) was not different between groups (1.28 +/- 0.28; 1.30 +/- 0.19; p < 0.05, respectively). Independent of BMI, no correlation was found between FF levels of oxidative markers and the number of oocytes retrieved or the fertilization rates. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found no difference in the levels of follicular oxidative and anti-oxidative markers or the follicular fluid viscosity with changing BMI values. We also demonstrated that the levels of oxidative stress markers and the viscosity of follicular fluid did not affect clinical outcomes.","['Yuksel, B', 'Kilic, S', 'Yilmaz, N', 'Goktas, T', 'Keskin, U', 'Seven, A', 'Ulubay, M', 'Batioglu, S']","['Yuksel B', 'Kilic S', 'Yilmaz N', 'Goktas T', 'Keskin U', 'Seven A', 'Ulubay M', 'Batioglu S']","['Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Infertility, Dumlupinar University Faculty of Medicine, Kutahya, Turkey. berilyuksel@gmail.com.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Infertility, Bahcesehir University Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', ""Department of Infertility, Dr. Zekai Tahir Burak Women's Health Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey."", 'Department of Physiology, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Infertility, Gulhane Military Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Infertility, Dumlupinar University Faculty of Medicine, Kutahya, Turkey.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Infertility, Gulhane Military Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey.', ""Department of Infertility, Dr. Zekai Tahir Burak Women's Health Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Ir J Med Sci,Irish journal of medical science,7806864,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro/*methods', 'Follicular Fluid/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*complications/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress/*immunology', 'Viscosity']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Body mass index', 'Follicular fluid', 'Malondialdehyde (MDA)', 'Oxidative stress', 'Sulfhydryl group (RSH)', 'Viscosity']",,2016/11/07 06:00,2018/04/05 06:00,['2016/11/07 06:00'],"['2016/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11845-016-1523-6 [pii]', '10.1007/s11845-016-1523-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Ir J Med Sci. 2017 Aug;186(3):641-646. doi: 10.1007/s11845-016-1523-6.

The interactions between obesity and the accompanying metabolic syndrome and diseases such as asthma, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have proven complex and often counterintuitive in human studies. Hence, there is a growing need for relevant experimental approaches to understand the interactions between obesity and the lung. To this end, researchers have increasingly exploited mouse models combining both obesity and lung diseases, including ARDS, pneumonia, and asthma. Such models have both complemented and advanced the understanding we have gained from clinical studies and have allowed elegant dissections of obesity's effects on the pathogenesis of lung disease.

A 30-year-old woman (weight 245 kg, body mass index 85 kg/m2) presented with dyspnea, for which investigations led to suspect pulmonary embolism. The patient's weight made it impossible to perform adapted imaging; thus, an empirical anticoagulant treatment was initiated. A hematoma of the thigh occurred as a consequence of a transient antivitamin K overdose, leading to a 15-cm necrotic wound worsened by a state of malnutrition. Multidisciplinary and comprehensive care was performed including wound trimming, antibiotics, skin grafting, treatment of malnutrition, and psychological support, but with marked difficulties due to the lack of adapted medical equipment and facilities as well as appropriate medical guidelines. Overall, 7 months of hospitalization including 4 months of physiotherapy and rehabilitation were needed before the patient could return home. This case highlights how difficult managing patients with extreme obesity can be and points to the importance for healthcare systems to adapt to the specific needs of these patients and to design specific guidelines for treatment dosage and malnutrition prevention and treatment in this setting.","['Lambert, Flora', 'Chalopin, Sarah', 'Bedock, Dorothee', 'Ciangura, Cecile', 'Aron-Wisnewsky, Judith', 'Faucher, Pauline', 'Aviles Marquez, Laura', 'Louhou, Rufin', 'Poitou, Christine', 'Oppert, Jean-Michel', 'Bel Lassen, Pierre']","['Lambert F', 'Chalopin S', 'Bedock D', 'Ciangura C', 'Aron-Wisnewsky J', 'Faucher P', 'Aviles Marquez L', 'Louhou R', 'Poitou C', 'Oppert JM', 'Bel Lassen P']","['Nutrition Department, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, CRNH Ile-de-France, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Nutrition Department, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, CRNH Ile-de-France, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Nutrition Department, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, CRNH Ile-de-France, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Nutrition Department, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, CRNH Ile-de-France, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Nutrition Department, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, CRNH Ile-de-France, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition & Obesities: Systemic Approaches Research Group (NutriOmics), Paris, France.', 'Nutrition Department, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, CRNH Ile-de-France, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Nutrition department, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Maritime de Berck, Berck, France.', 'Nutrition department, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Maritime de Berck, Berck, France.', 'Nutrition Department, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, CRNH Ile-de-France, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition & Obesities: Systemic Approaches Research Group (NutriOmics), Paris, France.', 'Nutrition Department, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, CRNH Ile-de-France, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Nutrition Department, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, CRNH Ile-de-France, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition & Obesities: Systemic Approaches Research Group (NutriOmics), Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],Switzerland,Obes Facts,Obesity facts,101469429,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Adult', 'Skin Transplantation', 'Obesity/complications/therapy', '*Obesity, Morbid/complications/surgery', '*Malnutrition/complications', 'Dyspnea/etiology']",PMC10028363,['NOTNLM'],"['Extreme obesity', 'Obesity', 'Weight bias']",['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],2022/12/16 06:00,2023/03/17 06:00,['2022/12/15 18:33'],"['2022/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2022/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2022/12/15 18:33 [entrez]']","['000527092 [pii]', 'ofa-0016-0212 [pii]', '10.1159/000527092 [doi]']",ppublish,Obes Facts. 2023;16(2):212-215. doi: 10.1159/000527092.

The present research explored the hypotheses that American adolescents have more negative obesity stereotypes than Chinese adolescents and that the effects of culture are mediated by weight attributions and thin idealization. Participants (N = 335; 181 female; M age = 14.83 years, SD = 1.57 years) completed measures of thin idealization and causal attributions and made generalizations from and attributions of stereotypical personality characteristics to obese figures. Not only did stereotypes differ between countries, but generalizations of negative characteristics from obese figures increased with age. In addition, American adolescents more firmly endorsed the 'thin ideal' and were more likely to attribute obesity to internal causes that Chinese adolescents. As anticipated, between-country differences in stereotyping were mediated by thin idealization and causal attributions. Findings are discussed in terms of the 'doctrine of the mean', social identity theory, and dual-process theories. Statement of Contribution The development of obesity stereotypes has been the subject of a number of recent studies. Although scarce, research on adolescents' obesity stereotypes indicates that the strength of these stereotypes increases with age and that these increases are mediated by thin idealization and causal attributions. The current research adds to this growing literature that differences between Chinese adolescents' and American adolescents' obesity stereotypes - in terms of the assignment of stereotypical traits to people with obesity and the generalization of negative traits from an individual person with obesity to people with obesity as a group - are mediated by thin idealization and attributions about obesity's causes. The research also indicates that (1) age differences in obesity stereotyping vary as a function of the method used to measure stereotypes, (2) Chinese adolescents are less likely than American adolescents to attribute obesity to characterological flaws, and (3) American adolescents idealize thinness more than Chinese adolescents.","['Klaczynski, Paul A', 'Felmban, Wejdan S']","['Klaczynski PA', 'Felmban WS']","['University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado, USA.', 'Effat University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Effat University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Dev Psychol,The British journal of developmental psychology,8308022,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Adolescent Development', 'China/ethnology', '*Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*ethnology', '*Social Perception', '*Stereotyping', 'Thinness/*ethnology', 'United States']",,['NOTNLM'],"['adolescent development', 'culture', 'dual-process theories', 'obesity stereotypes', 'social cognition', 'social identity theory']",,2018/05/29 06:00,2019/07/04 06:00,['2018/05/29 06:00'],"['2017/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjdp.12250 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Dev Psychol. 2019 Mar;37(1):14-32. doi: 10.1111/bjdp.12250.

Understanding the transcriptional program that controls EEC differentiation is important because some EEC types harbor significant therapeutic potential for type 2 diabetes. METHODS: EEC isolation from jejunum of obese individuals with (ObD) or without (Ob) type 2 diabetes was obtained with a new method of cell sorting. EEC transcriptional profiles were established by RNA-sequencing in a first group of 14 Ob and 13 ObD individuals. EEC lineage and densities were studied in the jejunum of a second independent group of 37 Ob, 21 ObD and 22 non obese (NOb) individuals. RESULTS: The RNA seq analysis revealed a distinctive transcriptomic signature and a decreased differentiation program in isolated EEC from ObD compared to Ob individuals. In the second independent group of ObD, Ob and NOb individuals a decreased GLP-1 cell lineage and GLP-1 maturation from proglucagon, were observed in ObD compared to Ob individuals. Furthermore, jejunal density of GLP-1-positive cells was significantly reduced in ObD compared to Ob individuals. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight that the transcriptomic signature of EEC discriminate obese subjects according to their diabetic status. Furthermore, type 2 diabetes is associated with reduced GLP-1 cell differentiation and proglucagon maturation leading to low GLP-1-cell density in human obesity. These mechanisms could account for the decrease plasma GLP-1 observed in metabolic diseases.","['Osinski, Celine', 'Le Gleau, Lea', 'Poitou, Christine', 'de Toro-Martin, Juan', 'Genser, Laurent', 'Fradet, Magali', 'Soula, Hedi Antoine', 'Leturque, Armelle', 'Blugeon, Corinne', 'Jourdren, Laurent', 'Hubert, Edwige Ludiwyne', 'Clement, Karine', 'Serradas, Patricia', 'Ribeiro, Agnes']","['Osinski C', 'Le Gleau L', 'Poitou C', 'de Toro-Martin J', 'Genser L', 'Fradet M', 'Soula HA', 'Leturque A', 'Blugeon C', 'Jourdren L', 'Hubert EL', 'Clement K', 'Serradas P', 'Ribeiro A']","['Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and obesities: systemic approaches, F-75013, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and obesities: systemic approaches, F-75013, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and obesities: systemic approaches, F-75013, Paris, France.', 'Nutrition Department, Pitie-Salpetriere hospital, Assistance Publique/Hopitaux de Paris, F-75013, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, Universite de Paris, INSERM, Cordeliers Research Center, F-75006, Paris, France.', 'Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods (INAF), School of Nutrition, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and obesities: systemic approaches, F-75013, Paris, France.', 'Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Gastrointestinal Surgery and Liver Transplantation, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Assistance Publique/Hopitaux de Paris, F-75013, Paris, France.', 'Cytometry platform, Institut Cardiometabolism and Nutrition, F-75013, Paris, France.', 'Institut de Biologie, CIRB, College de France, F-75005, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and obesities: systemic approaches, F-75013, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and obesities: systemic approaches, F-75013, Paris, France.', ""Genomics core facility, Departement de biologie, Institut de Biologie de l'ENS (IBENS), Ecole normale superieure, CNRS, INSERM, Universite PSL, 75005, Paris, France."", ""Genomics core facility, Departement de biologie, Institut de Biologie de l'ENS (IBENS), Ecole normale superieure, CNRS, INSERM, Universite PSL, 75005, Paris, France."", 'Sorbonne Universite, Universite de Paris, INSERM, Cordeliers Research Center, F-75006, Paris, France.', 'SERVIER, ADIR, F-92284, Suresnes, cedex, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and obesities: systemic approaches, F-75013, Paris, France.', 'Nutrition Department, Pitie-Salpetriere hospital, Assistance Publique/Hopitaux de Paris, F-75013, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and obesities: systemic approaches, F-75013, Paris, France. patricia.serradas_pacheco@sorbonne-universite.fr.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and obesities: systemic approaches, F-75013, Paris, France. agnes.ribeiro@sorbonne-universite.fr.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Obes (Lond),International journal of obesity (2005),101256108,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/epidemiology/metabolism', 'Enteroendocrine Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Jejunum/*cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Obesity/complications/epidemiology/metabolism']",PMC7752761,,,['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],2020/10/11 06:00,2021/12/21 06:00,['2020/10/10 05:32'],"['2020/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/10 05:32 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41366-020-00694-1 [pii]', '694 [pii]', '10.1038/s41366-020-00694-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Obes (Lond). 2021 Jan;45(1):170-183. doi: 10.1038/s41366-020-00694-1.

This has led to obesity being one of the most common consultations in general paediatrics and, particularly, in paediatric endocrinology. Furthermore, obesity associated comorbidities are increasing in prevalence in children and adolescents. It is widely accepted that this increase in the prevalence of obesity is derived from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure, associated to the lifestyle in western countries. However, there is increasing evidence of the role of individual and familial genetic background in the risk of developing obesity. The pathophysiological basis of the mechanisms responsible for the control of appetite and energy expenditure are being discovered on the basis of the increasing known cases of human monogenic, syndromic and endocrine obesity. Thus it is no longer appropriate to talk about obesity but rather about <<obesities>>, as their pathophysiological bases differ and they require different diagnostic and management approaches. In 2011, the paediatrician must be aware of this issue and focus the clinical history and physical examination towards these specific clinical sign and symptoms, to better manage the available diagnostic and therapeutic resources when faced with a child with obesity.","['Martos-Moreno, G A', 'Argente, J']","['Martos-Moreno GA', 'Argente J']","['Departamento de Pediatria, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Espana.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,An Pediatr (Barc),"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",101162596,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Obesity/complications/diagnosis/etiology/therapy']",,,,,2011/05/24 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S1695-4033(11)00203-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anpedi.2011.03.018 [doi]']",ppublish,An Pediatr (Barc). 2011 Jul;75(1):63.e1-23. doi: 10.1016/j.anpedi.2011.03.018.

Enhanced melanocortin signaling in the hypothalamus results in both decreased food intake and increased energy expenditure. The discovery of monogenic obesities with dysfunction of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) greatly contributed to understanding of energy balance regulation. This review presents phenotypical characterization and prevalence of the MC4R gene mutations. Genome-wide association studies revealed that MC4R gene is significantly related not only to monogenic obesities but also to common obesity. An interaction of variants in the MC4R gene with fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene significantly increases the risk for obesity, particularly in adolescence. On the other hand, about 15 % of the MC4R gene variants result in a gain of function that protects against obesity and is associated with favorable metabolic profile. Long-term attempts to activate the MC4R have recently been finalized by a discovery of setmelanotide, a novel specific MC4R agonist that is devoid of untoward cardiovascular side-effects. The employment of specific MC4R agonists may open new horizons not only in the treatment of rare monogenic obesities but also in some common obesities where stimulation of MC4R could be achieved.","['Hainer, V', 'Aldhoon Hainerova, I', 'Kunesova, M', 'Taxova Braunerova, R', 'Zamrazilova, H', 'Bendlova, B']","['Hainer V', 'Aldhoon Hainerova I', 'Kunesova M', 'Taxova Braunerova R', 'Zamrazilova H', 'Bendlova B']","['Obesity Management Center, Institute of Endocrinology, Prague, Czech Republic. vhainer@endo.cz.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Czech Republic,Physiol Res,Physiological research,9112413,"['0 (Anti-Obesity Agents)', '0 (Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4)', '581-05-5 (alpha-MSH)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Obesity Agents/pharmacology', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation', 'Obesity/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4/genetics/*metabolism', 'alpha-MSH/pharmacology']",PMC8603737,,,['Conflict of Interest There is no conflict of interest.'],2020/10/24 06:00,2021/09/01 06:00,['2020/10/23 08:38'],"['2020/10/23 08:38 [entrez]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['934512 [pii]', 'pr69_s245 [pii]', '10.33549/physiolres.934512 [doi]']",ppublish,Physiol Res. 2020 Sep 30;69(Suppl 2):S245-S254. doi: 10.33549/physiolres.934512.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nutrition support may mitigate some of these effects. Nutrition priorities in obese critically ill patients include screening for nutritional risk, estimation of energy and protein requirement, and provision of macronutrients and micronutrients. RECENT FINDINGS: Estimation of energy requirement in obese critically ill patients is challenging because of variations in body composition among obese patients and absence of reliable predictive equations for energy expenditure. Whereas hypocaloric nutrition with high protein has been advocated in obese critically ill patients, supporting data are scarce. Recent studies did not show differences in outcomes between hypocaloric and eucaloric nutrition, except for better glycemic control. Sarcopenia is common among obese patients, and the provision of increased protein intake has been suggested to mitigate catabolic changes especially after the acute phase of critical illness. However, high-quality data on high protein intake in these patients are lacking. Micronutrient deficiencies among obese critically ill patients are common but the role of their routine supplementation requires further study. SUMMARY: An individualized approach for nutritional support may be needed for obese critically ill patients but high-quality evidence is lacking. Future studies should focus on nutrition priorities in this population, with efficient and adequately powered studies.","['Al-Dorzi, Hasan M', 'Stapleton, Renee D', 'Arabi, Yaseen M']","['Al-Dorzi HM', 'Stapleton RD', 'Arabi YM']","['College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, and Intensive Care Department, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Pulmonary and Critical Medicine, University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont, USA.', 'College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, and Intensive Care Department, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,9804399,['0 (Dietary Proteins)'],IM,"['*Critical Illness/therapy', '*Dietary Proteins', 'Energy Intake', 'Humans', 'Nutritional Requirements', 'Nutritional Support', 'Obesity/complications/metabolism/therapy']",,,,,2021/12/22 06:00,2022/05/07 06:00,['2021/12/21 06:06'],"['2021/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/21 06:06 [entrez]']","['00075197-202203000-00010 [pii]', '10.1097/MCO.0000000000000803 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care. 2022 Mar 1;25(2):99-109. doi: 10.1097/MCO.0000000000000803.,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Furthermore, few researchers have assessed obesity's effect on the health status of established HF patients. This study evaluated the influence of obesity on the health status, at baseline and 1 year later, on patients with established HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Comprehensive clinical data, health status, and obesity classification of 543 HF outpatients from 13 centers was assessed at baseline and 1 year later. Health status was quantified with the generic Short Form-12 and disease-specific Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary score. Cross-sectional and longitudinal risk-adjusted general linear models were computed comparing the health status of patients who were classified as either underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Obesity classification was not significantly associated with patients' baseline health status and did not predict 1-year health status. CONCLUSIONS: Although obesity has been reported to confer a survival advantage to patients with HF, it was not associated with better health status at baseline, or after 1 year, in our cohort. Better understanding of the relationship among HF, body weight, and health status is needed before evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding weight management for HF patients.","['Conard, Mark W', 'Haddock, C Keith', 'Poston, Walker S Carlos', 'Havranek, Edward', 'McCullough, Peter', 'Spertus, John']","['Conard MW', 'Haddock CK', 'Poston WS', 'Havranek E', 'McCullough P', 'Spertus J']","['University of Missouri, Kansas City, Missouri, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Card Fail,Journal of cardiac failure,9442138,,IM,"['Aged', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cardiac Output, Low/*complications/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diabetes Complications', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/etiology', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/classification/*complications/physiopathology', 'Overweight']",,,,,2006/12/19 09:00,2007/01/27 09:00,['2006/12/19 09:00'],"['2006/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2006/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1071-9164(06)00883-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cardfail.2006.08.006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Card Fail. 2006 Dec;12(9):700-6. doi: 10.1016/j.cardfail.2006.08.006.,,,,,,,,,,['Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Consortium'],,,,,,,,,,

Women with obesity are traditionally limited by the choices available to them during pregnancy and birth because of the higher risk of complications. This evidence synthesis set out to summarise how women with obesity's perceptions of pregnancy and birth risk influence the care choices that they make. METHODS: A search of medical and health databases for qualitative studies written in the English language, published Jan 1993-April 2019 and reporting on pregnant women with obesity's perception of risk and influence of pregnancy and birth choices. Data was extracted by two reviewers onto a questions framework and then analysed using a thematic synthesis technique. Confidence in the qualitative findings was assessed using GRADE-CERQual. RESULTS: 23 full texts were included. The common themes on perception of risk were: 'Self-blame arising from others' stereotyped beliefs ', 'Normalisation', 'Lack of preparation', 'Fearful acceptance and inevitability' and 'Baby prioritised over mother'. For influence of choices, the themes were: 'External influences from personal stresses', 'Restrictive guidelines', 'Relationship with healthcare professional' and 'Perception of Risk'. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on what influences women with obesity's pregnancy choices is limited.

RESULTS: Using body mass index (BMI), 39.8% of children were obese. A significant relationship was found between childhood obesity and computer usage, television watching, total hours in sedentary behavior, and maternal BMI. An indirect significant relationship with childhood obesity was also shown if a parent was home when the child got home from school and if a father participated in exercise with their child. Caloric intake, total time in physical activity, demographic variables, and father's BMI showed no significant relationship with children's BMI. CONCLUSION: Interventions should be designed targeting total time spent on the computer, total time watching television, and maternal obesity in child obesity programs.","['Arluk, Shaye L', 'Branch, J David', 'Swain, David P', 'Dowling, Elizabeth A']","['Arluk SL', 'Branch JD', 'Swain DP', 'Dowling EA']","['Undergraduate Exercise Science Program, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA 23529, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mil Med,Military medicine,2984771R,,IM,"['Anthropometry', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Diet Surveys', 'Energy Intake', 'Energy Metabolism', '*Exercise', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Military Medicine', 'Military Personnel/*statistics & numerical data', '*Nuclear Family', 'Obesity/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Risk Factors', 'Television', 'Time Factors', 'Virginia/epidemiology']",,,,,2003/08/07 05:00,2003/09/18 05:00,['2003/08/07 05:00'],"['2003/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mil Med. 2003 Jul;168(7):583-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weight management strategies such as diet and hydration should balance nutritional requirements with weight loss; particular attention to protein needs in chair- and bedbound patients is necessary. Additional approaches such as exercise, bariatric weight loss surgery, and weight loss medication should be considered on an individual basis related to their inherent risks in this population. Weight loss/management options framed from an interdisciplinary perspective can improve quality of life for these patients and their caregivers. Research specific to obesity in this age group is warranted.","['Gallagher Camden, Susan', 'Gates, Judy']","['Gallagher Camden S', 'Gates J']","['Celebration Institute, Inc., Houston, TX, USA.

We sought to define the association between childhood obesity and household income and how household income and childhood behaviors promote childhood obesity. METHODS: We assessed body mass index in 109,634 Massachusetts children, identifying the percentage of children who were overweight/obese versus the percentage of children in each community residing in low-income homes. We compared activity patterns and diet in 999 sixth graders residing in 4 Michigan communities with varying annual household income. RESULTS: In Massachusetts, percentage of overweight/obese by community varied from 9.6% to 42.8%. As household income dropped, percentage of overweight/obese children rose. In Michigan sixth graders, as household income goes down, frequency of fried food consumption per day doubles from 0.23 to 0.54 (P < .002), and daily TV/video time triples from 0.55 to 2.00 hours (P < .001), whereas vegetable consumption and moderate/vigorous exercise go down. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of overweight/obese children rises in communities with lower household income. Children residing in lower income communities exhibit poorer dietary and physical activity behaviors, which affect obesity.","['Eagle, Taylor F', 'Sheetz, Anne', 'Gurm, Roopa', 'Woodward, Alan C', 'Kline-Rogers, Eva', 'Leibowitz, Robert', 'Durussel-Weston, Jean', 'Palma-Davis, LaVaughn', 'Aaronson, Susan', 'Fitzgerald, Catherine M', 'Mitchell, Lindsey R', 'Rogers, Bruce', 'Bruenger, Patricia', 'Skala, Katherine A', 'Goldberg, Caren', 'Jackson, Elizabeth A', 'Erickson, Steven R', 'Eagle, Kim A']","['Eagle TF', 'Sheetz A', 'Gurm R', 'Woodward AC', 'Kline-Rogers E', 'Leibowitz R', 'Durussel-Weston J', 'Palma-Davis L', 'Aaronson S', 'Fitzgerald CM', 'Mitchell LR', 'Rogers B', 'Bruenger P', 'Skala KA', 'Goldberg C', 'Jackson EA', 'Erickson SR', 'Eagle KA']","['Cardiovascular Center, University of Michigan Health System, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-5852, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am Heart J,American heart journal,0370465,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Attitude to Health', '*Body Mass Index', 'Child', '*Child Behavior', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Diet', 'Exercise/*physiology', 'Family Characteristics', 'Health Status Disparities', 'Humans', 'Income', '*Life Style', 'Male', 'Mass Screening/organization & administration', 'Massachusetts/epidemiology', 'Michigan/epidemiology', 'Obesity/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Obesity, Morbid/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Overweight/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Assessment', 'School Health Services', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/08/01 06:00,['2012/05/22 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-8703(12)00174-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ahj.2012.02.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Am Heart J. 2012 May;163(5):836-43. doi: 10.1016/j.ahj.2012.02.025.,['2 R25 CA57712/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Mosby, Inc.

According to an island-wide survey, the prevalence of obesity varied from 4.3% to 17.4% in children aged three to nineteen years. Obesity is defined as an excess of body fat. Since the standard references of weight-for-height and body mass index for Taiwanese are not available, a weight-for-length index has been introduced. We have found that its easy computation and interpretation with high reliability make it a desirable measure of relative weight either in clinical practice or in research. The family background of the obese children has been investigated by many workers. In our own series, the obese children were about five times as likely to have an obese parent as control. There was also a significant difference in the chance of having an obese sibling between the obese and control groups. Several health sequelae of childhood obesity have been studied in Taiwan. Obese children appear to have high prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and abnormal glucose metabolism. Of several cutaneous manifestations of obesity, colored striae were sometimes overlooked. In our experience, 40% of the moderate to severe obese cases have such striking marks prominently located on the thighs, arms and abdomen. A few pediatric weight-losing programs have been carried out in Taiwan. In our Pediatric Anti-Obesity Club, four fundamental components: diet, exercise, behavior modification and parent involvement were included in the treatment program. In family-based parent-directed program, 11% of the participants showed decreases in degree of obesity after one year follow-up, compared to 3% of a control group. In another individualized outpatient counseling clinic, the success rate was 59% after one year. Although the long-term effectiveness cannot determined, it seems rational that a realistic and culturally sensitive weight reduction program should be developed for countries, such as Taiwan, with increasing prevalence of childhood obesity.","['Chen, W']",['Chen W'],"['China Medical College, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China (Republic : 1949- ),Zhonghua Min Guo Xiao Er Ke Yi Xue Hui Za Zhi,Zhonghua Minguo xiao er ke yi xue hui za zhi [Journal].

First, it determines if there is a relationship between body weight and the onset of functional impairment across time among this sample of older adults. More specifically, it examines if obese older adults are more likely to experience the onset of functional impairment. Second, it explores how health behaviors and health conditions may explain the relationship between body weight and the onset of functional impairment. DESIGN AND METHODS: With the use of longitudinal data from the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) survey, logistic regression models on the onset of functional impairment over two time points are estimated for older adults. RESULTS: Results indicate that body weight (more specifically being overweight or obese) makes one more likely to experience the onset of functional impairment across various domains of impairment. Outside of health behaviors and health conditions, obesity has an independent effect on the onset of impairment in strength, lower body mobility, and activities of daily living. IMPLICATIONS: Study findings support the active treatment of weight problems in older adults. Future directions for research in this area should address effective weight management interventions targeting issues related to older individuals.","['Jenkins, Kristi Rahrig']",['Jenkins KR'],"['The Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, 426 Thompson Street, Box 1248, Room 2044, Ann Arbor, MI 48106-1248, USA. kristirj@isr.umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Gerontologist,The Gerontologist,0375327,,IM,"['*Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Body Weight', 'Chronic Disease/epidemiology', 'Disabled Persons/*statistics & numerical data', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Motor Activity/physiology', 'Movement/physiology', 'Obesity/complications/epidemiology/*physiopathology', 'Risk-Taking', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,,2004/04/13 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/04/13 05:00'],"['2004/04/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/04/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/geront/44.2.206 [doi]'],ppublish,Gerontologist. 2004 Apr;44(2):206-16. doi: 10.1093/geront/44.2.206.,['5T32 AG 00221/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Online surveys were conducted among 3,008 adult PwO (BMI>/=30 by self-reported height and weight) and 606 HCPs. Results: PwO with weight loss >/= 10% during the previous three years were more likely to have been diagnosed with obesity and to have discussed a weight loss plan with an HCP. However, only 21% believe HCPs have a responsibility to actively contribute to their obesity treatment. Further, HCPs tend not to effectively communicate the diagnosis of obesity, its nature as a serious and chronic disease, the full range of treatment options, and obesity's implications for health and quality of life. Regarding treatment goals, HCPs more often focus on BMI reduction, while PwO's goals focus on improved functioning, energy, and appearance. HCPs also tend to underestimate their patients' motivation to address their obesity. Twenty-eight percent of HCPs 'completely agreed' that losing weight was a high priority for PwO, whereas more than half of PwO 'completely agreed' that losing weight was a high priority for them. When asked how their HCP could better support them, PwO most often expressed a desire for helpful resources, as well as assistance with specific and realistic goal-setting to improve health. Conclusions: HCPs can more effectively implement obesity treatment guidelines by more clearly and proactively communicating with PwO about their diagnosis, health implications of obesity, desired treatment goals, and the full range of treatment options. HCPs should understand that most PwO believe that managing their disease is solely their own responsibility. HCPs can also encourage more effective conversations by better appreciating their patients' motivation and treatment goals.","['Look, Michelle', 'Kolotkin, Ronette L', 'Dhurandhar, Nikhil V', 'Nadglowski, Joseph', 'Stevenin, Boris', 'Golden, Angela']","['Look M', 'Kolotkin RL', 'Dhurandhar NV', 'Nadglowski J', 'Stevenin B', 'Golden A']","['a San Diego Sports Medicine and Family Health , San Diego , CA , USA.', 'b Quality of Life Consulting , Durham , NC , USA.', 'c Department of Community and Family Medicine , Duke University School of Medicine , Durham , NC , USA.', 'd Faculty of Health Studies , Western Norway University of Applied Sciences , Forde , Norway.', 'e Forde Hospital Trust , Forde , Norway.', 'f Morbid Obesity Centre, Vestfold Hospital Trust , Tonsberg , Norway.', 'g Nutritional Sciences , Texas Tech University , Lubbock , TX , USA.', 'h Obesity Action Coalition , Tampa , FL , USA.', 'i Novo Nordisk Inc ., Plainsboro , NJ , USA.', 'j NP from Home, LLC ., Munds Park , AZ , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Postgrad Med,Postgraduate medicine,0401147,,IM,"['Adult', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', '*Attitude to Health', 'Female', 'Health Personnel/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*pathology/therapy', '*Self Report', 'Self-Management/psychology', 'Social Support', 'Weight Loss']",,['NOTNLM'],"['People with obesity', 'attitudes towards obesity', 'clinical treatment guidelines', 'obesity management', 'weight loss']",,2019/06/04 06:00,2019/07/03 06:00,['2019/06/04 06:00'],"['2019/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00325481.2019.1620616 [doi]'],ppublish,Postgrad Med. 2019 Jun;131(5):357-365. doi: 10.1080/00325481.2019.1620616.

Given energetic expenditure in standing, a complete understanding of compensation in obese patients with sagittal malalignment remains relevant. PURPOSE: This study compares obese and non-obese patients with progressive sagittal malalignment for differences in recruitment of pelvic and lower-limb mechanisms. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Single-center retrospective review. PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 554 patients (277 obese, 277 non-obese) were identified for analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Upper body alignment parameters: sagittal vertical axis (SVA) and T1 spinopelvic inclination (T1SPi). Compensatory lower-limb mechanisms: pelvic translation (pelvic shift [PS]), knee (KA) and ankle (AA) flexion, hip extension (sacrofemoral angle [SFA]), and global sagittal angle (GSA). METHODS: Inclusion criteria were patients >/=18 years who underwent full-body stereographic x-rays. Included patients were categorized as non-obese (N-Ob: body mass index [BMI]<30 kg/m(2)) or obese (Ob: BMI>/=30 kg/m(2)). To control for potential confounders, groups were propensity score matched by age, gender, and baseline pelvic incidence (PI), and subsequently categorized by increasing spinopelvic (pelvic incidence minus lumbar lordosis [PI-LL]) mismatch: <10 degrees , 10 degrees -20 degrees , >20 degrees . Independent t tests and linear regression models compared sagittal (SVA, T1SPi) and lower limb (PS, KA, AA, SFA, GSA) parameters between obesity cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 554 patients (277 Ob, 277 N-Ob) were included for analysis and were stratified to the following mismatch categories: <10 degrees : n=367; 10 degrees -20 degrees : n=91; >20 degrees : n=96. Obese patients had higher SVA, KA, PS, and GSA than N-Ob patients (p<.001 all). Low PI-LL mismatch Ob patients had greater SVA with lower SFA (142.22 degrees  vs. 156.66 degrees , p=.032), higher KA (5.22 degrees  vs. 2.93 degrees , p=.004), and higher PS (4.91 vs. -5.20 mm, p<.001) than N-Ob patients. With moderate PI-LL mismatch, Ob patients similarly demonstrated greater SVA, KA, and PS, combined with significantly lower PT (23.69 degrees  vs. 27.14 degrees , p=.012). Obese patients of highest (>20 degrees ) PI-LL mismatch showed greatest forward malalignment (SVA, T1SPi) with significantly greater PS, and a concomitantly high GSA (12.86 degrees  vs. 9.67 degrees , p=.005). Regression analysis for lower-limb compensation revealed that increasing BMI and PI-LL predicted KA (r(2)=0.234) and GSA (r(2)=0.563). CONCLUSIONS: With progressive sagittal malalignment, obese patients differentially recruit lower extremity compensatory mechanisms, whereas non-obese patients preferentially recruit pelvic mechanisms. The ability to compensate for progressive sagittal malalignment with the pelvic retroversion is limited by obesity.","['Jalai, Cyrus M', 'Diebo, Bassel G', 'Cruz, Dana L', 'Poorman, Gregory W', 'Vira, Shaleen', 'Buckland, Aaron J', 'Lafage, Renaud', 'Bess, Shay', 'Errico, Thomas J', 'Lafage, Virginie', 'Passias, Peter G']","['Jalai CM', 'Diebo BG', 'Cruz DL', 'Poorman GW', 'Vira S', 'Buckland AJ', 'Lafage R', 'Bess S', 'Errico TJ', 'Lafage V', 'Passias PG']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hospital for Joint Diseases, NYU Langone Medical Center, 301 East 17th St, New York, NY 10003, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hospital for Special Surgery, 535 E 70th St, New York, NY 10021, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hospital for Joint Diseases, NYU Langone Medical Center, 301 East 17th St, New York, NY 10003, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hospital for Special Surgery, 535 E 70th St, New York, NY 10021, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hospital for Joint Diseases, NYU Langone Medical Center, 301 East 17th St, New York, NY 10003, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hospital for Joint Diseases, NYU Langone Medical Center, 301 East 17th St, New York, NY 10003, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hospital for Special Surgery, 535 E 70th St, New York, NY 10021, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hospital for Joint Diseases, NYU Langone Medical Center, 301 East 17th St, New York, NY 10003, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hospital for Joint Diseases, NYU Langone Medical Center, 301 East 17th St, New York, NY 10003, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hospital for Special Surgery, 535 E 70th St, New York, NY 10021, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hospital for Joint Diseases, NYU Langone Medical Center, 301 East 17th St, New York, NY 10003, USA.

Thus, the most common forms of obesity would depend on the interaction of multiple genes as well as on the influence of various environmental factors, such as eating behaviour and lifestyle. Although none of these genes potentially involved in the control of body weight seems to be directly responsible for the syndrome, there have been reports of interesting associations between polymorphisms of certain candidate genes and obesity or its metabolic complications.

Environmental factors (early pre- and post-natal, societal or psychological determinants) always interact closely with the genetic factors of predisposition.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is marked by the presence of proinflammatory cytokines and, in general, the presence of high levels of inflammatory markers is associated with a severe disease course and joint damage. AIM: To assess the impact of obesity on disease activity, quality of life and articular damage in patients with established RA. METHODS: Between July 2009 to December 2009, 119 RA patients were included and divided in two groups according to the body mass index (obeses and controls). RA activity was assessed by the Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28, quality of life by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and radiographic joint damage by the modified Sharp score. RESULTS: Obesity was not correlated with worsen RA activity (p=0.71) nor quality of life impairment (p=0.51). The obese group had a lower modified Sharp score than the control group (64.97versus113.64; p < 0.032) and this association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, disease activity, extraarticular manifestations, comorbidities, presence of rheumatoid factor, and disease duration. CONCLUSION: Obesity does not have an impact on disease activity nor changes in quality of life, but it has a protective effect on the amount of joint destruction in established rheumatoid arthritis.","['Tekaya, Raoudha', 'Sahli, Hana', 'Zribi, Saida', 'Mahmoud, Ines', 'Ben Hadj Yahia, Chiraz', 'Abdelmoula, Leila', 'Chaabouni, Lilia', 'Zouari, Rafik']","['Tekaya R', 'Sahli H', 'Zribi S', 'Mahmoud I', 'Ben Hadj Yahia C', 'Abdelmoula L', 'Chaabouni L', 'Zouari R']","['Hopital Charles Nicolle, Tunis, Tunisie.']",['fre'],['Journal Article'],Tunisia,Tunis Med,La Tunisie medicale,0413766,,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/pathology/physiology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*complications/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Arthrography', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Cytoprotection/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Joints/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motor Activity', 'Obesity/*complications/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Quality of Life', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2011/05/11 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['/article-medicale-tunisie.php?article=1716 [pii]'],ppublish,Tunis Med. 2011 May;89(5):462-5.,,,,,,,,,L'obesite est un facteur protecteur contre l'atteinte structurale au cours de la polyarthrite rhumatoide.,,,,,,,,,,,

A concurrent increase in obesity has led some to suggest a relationship between the two trends. We explore the extent of this relationship. METHODS: Using a previously validated disease simulation model of white males in the United States, we estimated EAC incidence 1973 to 2005 given constant obesity prevalence and low population progression rates consistent with the early 1970s. Introducing only the observed, rising obesity prevalence, we calculated the incremental incidence caused by obesity. We compared these with EAC incidence data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry to determine obesity's contribution to the rise therein. Incidences were converted to absolute numbers of cases using U.S. population data. RESULTS: Using constant obesity prevalence, we projected a total of 30,555 EAC cases cumulatively over 1973 to 2005 and 1,151 in 2005 alone. Incorporating the observed obesity trend resulted in 35,767 cumulative EACs and 1,608 in 2005. Estimates derived from SEER data showed 111,223 cumulative and 7,173 cases in 2005. We conclude that the rise in obesity accounted for 6.5% of the increase in EAC cases that occurred from 1973 to 2005 and 7.6% in the year 2005. CONCLUSION: Using published OR for EAC among obese individuals, we found that only a small percentage of the rise in EAC incidence is attributable to secular trends in obesity. IMPACT: Other factors, alone and in combination, should be explored as causes of the EAC epidemic.","['Kong, Chung Yin', 'Nattinger, Kevin J', 'Hayeck, Tristan J', 'Omer, Zehra B', 'Wang, Y Claire', 'Spechler, Stuart J', 'McMahon, Pamela M', 'Gazelle, G Scott', 'Hur, Chin']","['Kong CY', 'Nattinger KJ', 'Hayeck TJ', 'Omer ZB', 'Wang YC', 'Spechler SJ', 'McMahon PM', 'Gazelle GS', 'Hur C']","['Institute for Technology Assessment, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*epidemiology/ethnology/etiology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*epidemiology/ethnology/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Models, Statistical', 'Obesity/complications/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology', 'White People']",PMC3382986,,,"['Conflict of Interest Disclosures: All authors have completed and submitted the', 'form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest and the following were', 'reported: Stuart Spechler: AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals: Grant/Research Support', 'Ironwood Pharmaceuticals Inc.: Consulting fee Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd:', 'Grant/Research Support XenoPort, Inc.: Consulting fee Torax Medical: Consulting', 'fee BARRX Medical, Inc.: Grant/Research Support G Scott Gazelle: GE Healthcare:', 'Consulting fee The remaining authors disclosed no potential conflicts of', 'interest.']",2011/09/21 06:00,2012/05/10 06:00,['2011/09/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-11-0547 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-11-0547 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2011 Nov;20(11):2450-6. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-11-0547.

Lung protective ventilation strategies, supplemented by lung-recruiting manoeuvres, may be feasible in critically ill obese patients with lung injury. Careful positioning of the obese is essential to optimise ventilation and facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation. Optimal hypocaloric nutrition with a high proportion of proteins is advised to control hyperglycaemia.

Its use has dramatically increased in number as it enables both weight reduction and metabolic improvements, with 60% of patients even achieving diabetes remission. Several mechanisms are actually demonstrated to be involved in those clinical improvements. Importantly, both obesity and T2D share many phenotypic characteristics, including increased systemic and adipose tissue inflammation, as well as gut microbiota dysbiosis.

First, they have to consider the motivation of the obese patient to change his habits. When the patient is not motivated to loss weight, their role is to identify and treat co-morbidities, to evaluate the risk related to the obesity and to establish a therapeutic diagnosis to evaluate motivation and ability to change. If the patient is motivated, the therapeutic choices have to be adapted individually to each patient. An inadequate management may not only result in a failure but may increase obesity. The objectives in obesity treatment are to achieve weight loss in order to reduce health risk as far as possible, to maintain that weight loss, to restore quality of life. Goals and methods must be realistic. Even a modest weight loss (5-10 % of initial weight) will improve health indices in an obese patient. Dietary treatment and physical activity are fundamental to the management of obesity. Compliance with the diet is the major problem, especially during the phase of weight maintenance after the excess weight loss has been lost. Initial weight reduction depends on the level of energy deficit and weight maintenance on compliance to a low fat diet and a physical activity programme. Cognitive behavioural approaches should be an integral part of the management of a chronic disease.

Obesity's effects on the vascular systems of young adults and African Americans have not been well characterized. The aim of this study was to assess the association between measures of obesity and aortic stiffness in 186 young adults (20 to 40 years, 50% African American) and 177 older adults (41 to 70 years, 33% African American). Aortic stiffness was measured by aortic pulse-wave velocity. The median pulse-wave velocity value was 468 cm/s for young adults and 627 cm/s for older adults (P<0.001). Higher body weight, body mass index, waist and hip circumferences, and waist-hip ratio were strongly correlated with higher pulse-wave velocity, independent of age, systolic blood pressure, race, and sex overall and among both age groups (P<0.01 for all). Even among the 20- to 30-year-olds, obese individuals (body mass index>30) had a mean pulse-wave velocity value 47 cm/s higher than did nonobese individuals (P<0.001). Obesity measures were among the strongest independent predictors of pulse-wave velocity overall and for both age groups. Results were consistent by race. In conclusion, excess body weight is associated with higher aortic stiffness in whites and African Americans as young as 20 to 30 years. The strength of the association, the early age at which it appears, and the prevalence of obesity among the young warn of substantially increased cardiovascular disease incidence as this cohort ages.","['Wildman, Rachel P', 'Mackey, Rachel H', 'Bostom, Andrew', 'Thompson, Trina', 'Sutton-Tyrrell, Kim']","['Wildman RP', 'Mackey RH', 'Bostom A', 'Thompson T', 'Sutton-Tyrrell K']","['Department of Epidemiology, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hypertension,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",7906255,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aorta/*physiopathology', 'Compliance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/diagnosis/ethnology/*physiopathology', 'Pulsatile Flow']",,,,,2003/09/04 05:00,2003/11/11 05:00,['2003/09/04 05:00'],"['2003/09/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/09/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['01.HYP.0000090360.78539.CD [pii]', '10.1161/01.HYP.0000090360.78539.CD [doi]']",ppublish,Hypertension. 2003 Oct;42(4):468-73. doi: 10.1161/01.HYP.0000090360.78539.CD.

A novel pilot program to begin teaching medical students about care of the obese patient was developed and student attitudes toward obesity and bariatric surgery were assessed. METHODS: The authors paired third-year students with obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Students established a longitudinal patient relationship, received faculty mentorship, and kept a reflections journal. An attitude assessment survey was administered before and after third year. Reflections were analyzed for common themes. RESULTS: Baseline student responses differed from those previously reported for practicing physicians on many survey statements, including more strongly agreeing with the relationship between obesity and serious medical conditions (P < .001), the need to educate patients about obesity risks (P < .001), and willingness to recommend bariatric surgery evaluation (P = .004). These differences were maintained after clinical clerkships. Reflection themes included recognition of obesity stereotypes, improved estimation of body mass index, and awareness of physicians' attitudes about obesity. CONCLUSION: Development and assessment of a novel pilot program to teach third-year medical students about obesity and bariatric surgery suggests a potential impact on student attitudes and understanding of obesity and obesity surgery. Students today may have different attitudes toward obesity than those reflected in prior data for physicians in practice, and programs such as this may help maintain positive attitudes.","['Roberts, David H', 'Kane, Erin M', 'Jones, Daniel B', 'Almeida, Jacqueline M', 'Bell, Sigall K', 'Weinstein, Amy R', 'Schwartzstein, Richard M']","['Roberts DH', 'Kane EM', 'Jones DB', 'Almeida JM', 'Bell SK', 'Weinstein AR', 'Schwartzstein RM']","['Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. dhrobert@bidmc.harvard.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Surg Innov,Surgical innovation,101233809,,IM,"['Academic Medical Centers', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Bariatric Surgery/*education', 'Boston', '*Curriculum', '*Education, Medical, Undergraduate/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Obesity/diagnosis/prevention & control/*surgery', 'Pilot Projects', 'Students, Medical']",PMC3372903,,,,2011/02/24 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/02/24 06:00'],"['2011/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['1553350611399298 [pii]', '10.1177/1553350611399298 [doi]']",ppublish,Surg Innov. 2011 Jun;18(2):176-83. doi: 10.1177/1553350611399298.

The obese diabetic patient with ESRD is a challenge for the nephrologist with regard to the type of renal replacement therapy that should be suggested and offered to the patient. There is no evidence that either peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis is contraindicated in obese ESRD patients. In the literature, we can find a discrepancy in the impact of obesity on mortality among hemodialysis vs. peritoneal dialysis patients. Several studies in hemodialysis patients suggest that a higher BMI confers a survival advantage - the so-called ""reverse epidemiology"". In contrast, the literature among obese peritoneal dialysis patients is inconsistent, with various studies reporting an increased risk of death, no difference, or a decreased risk of death. Many of these studies only spanned across a few years, and this is probably too short of a time frame for a realistic assessment of obesity's impact on mortality in ESRD patients. The decision for dialysis modality in an obese diabetic patient with ESRD should be individualized. According to the results of published studies, we cannot suggest PD or HD as a better solution for all obese diabetic patients. The obese patient should be educated about all their dialysis options, including home dialysis therapies.

Over 2 years, 25 medical students from each semester were trained and presented to 1590 freshmen and sophomores at suburban HSs in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The program included an interactive power point and a 30-day challenge to make small measurable changes in their current health behaviors. A modified team-based learning format was included to engage students and increase classroom interaction. RESULTS: Medical students reported the program improved their ability to communicate with adolescents and enhanced their training as future physicians. Teachers felt students had sustained retention of knowledge at the end of 30 days and the majority of students fulfilled their self-imposed challenge.

In any individual - and in the same individual at different times of life - the relative influence of these factors may vary. In this sense, obesity is a prototype of many of the diseases now confronting medical science. Among the most important concepts regarding such phenotypes is the idea that relevant genes mediate susceptibility to disease in a specific environmental context, not the inevitable occurrence of the phenotype regardless of the environment. Individuals with otherwise potent genetic predisposition to obesity will be lean in an environment of food deprivation/high demand for physical activity, and individuals not genetically predisposed to obesity may become so in an environment that includes tasty, calorically dense foods and/or few inducements to physical activity. Thus, in any effort to elucidate the genetic bases for susceptibility to obesity, the ""environment"" in which the obesity is occurring remains a critical factor regarding what sorts of genes will be identified. Because the genes that mediate susceptibility to obesity may affect energy intake, energy expenditure and/or the partitioning of calories between lean tissues and fat, the ability to define the gross metabolic basis for the obesity is very important in determining which genes are relevant to the phenotype. Because it is so difficult to experimentally define/control the environment of humans, and because the attainment of an obese state may actually rectify the metabolic differences predisposing to obesity, animal models of obesity have been looked at intensively for clues to the relevant genes in humans. Over the past 40 years, a series of autosomal dominant (Yellow) and recessive (obese, diabetes, tubby, fat, fatty) obesity mutations have been described in mice and rats. The molecular cloning of all of these genes has been accomplished within the past 4 years, providing an exciting array of new reagents for the molecular analysis of obesity. These genes encode molecules that appear to interact in physiologic systems that influence body fat stores. The genes and their apparent functions are summarized in the Table . The locations of these genes in the genomes of rodents and human are known, as are their genetic structure/sequence. Thus, their role(s) in human obesity can now be assessed directly.","['Leibel, R L']",['Leibel RL'],"['Laboratory of Human Behavior & Metabolism, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Obesity/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Rats', 'Species Specificity']",,,,,1997/09/01 00:00,1997/09/01 00:01,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jn/127.9.1908S [doi]'],ppublish,J Nutr. 1997 Sep;127(9):1908S. doi: 10.1093/jn/127.9.1908S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no indication that the huge increase in obesity seen the last decades is declining. The examination of psychological aspects of persons with morbid obesity is essential. Identification of the psychological factors associated with weight loss expands our knowledge about behaviors which are crucial in order to avoid failures in treatment. Most information on this is obtained preoperatively. Although there is no single personality type characteristic of the morbidly obese, they differ from the general population as their self-esteem and impulse control is lower. They have passive dependent and passive aggressive personality traits, as well as a trend for somatization and problem denial. Their thinking is usually dichotomous and catastrophic. Obese patients also show low cooperativeness and fail to see the self as autonomous and integrated. In the morbidly obese before undergoing surgical treatment, unusual prevalence of psychopathology, namely depression and anxiety disorders, is observed.

The intraoperative period represents an important opportunity to optimise and mitigate risk. However, there is little formal guidance on what intraoperative monitoring techniques should be used in this population. This narrative review collates the existing evidence for intraoperative monitoring devices in the obese patients. Although a number of non-invasive blood pressure monitors have been tested, an invasive arterial line remains the most reliable monitor if accurate, continuous monitoring is required. Goal-directed fluid therapy is recommended by clinical practice guidelines, but the methods tested to assess this had guarded applicability to the obese population. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (CO(2)) monitoring may offer additional benefit to standard capnography in this population. Individually titrated positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and recruitment manoeuvres improved intraoperative mechanics but yielded no benefit in the immediate postoperative period. Depth of anaesthesia monitoring appears to be beneficial in the perioperative period regarding recovery times and complications. Objective confirmation of reversal of neuromuscular blockade continues to be a central tenet of anaesthesia practice, particularly relevant to this group who have been characterised as an ""at risk"" extubation group. Where deep neuromuscular blockade is used, continuous neuromuscular blockade is suggested. Both obesity and the intraoperative context represent somewhat unstable search terms, as the clinical implications of the obesity phenotype are not uniform, and the type and urgency of surgery have significant impact on the intraoperative setting. This renders the generation of summary conclusions around what intraoperative monitoring techniques are suitable in this population highly challenging.","['Haren, Andrea P', 'Nair, Shrijit', 'Pace, Maria C', 'Sansone, Pasquale']","['Haren AP', 'Nair S', 'Pace MC', 'Sansone P']","[""Department of Anaesthesia, St Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin 4, Dublin, Ireland."", ""Department of Anaesthesia, St Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin 4, Dublin, Ireland."", 'University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.', 'University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy. pasquale.sansone@unicampania.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Ther,Advances in therapy,8611864,,,"['*Anesthesia', 'Humans', 'Monitoring, Intraoperative', '*Neuromuscular Blockade', 'Obesity/complications/epidemiology/surgery', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration']",PMC8179704,['NOTNLM'],"['Intraoperative', 'Monitoring', 'Obese', 'Obesity', 'Perioperative']",,2021/06/07 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2021/06/06 21:19'],"['2021/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/06/06 21:19 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12325-021-01774-y [pii]', '1774 [pii]', '10.1007/s12325-021-01774-y [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Ther. 2021 Jul;38(7):3622-3651. doi: 10.1007/s12325-021-01774-y.

DEVELOPMENT: The early onset of (PWS) is characterised by a severe neonatal hypotonia with poor suck reflex--which may lead to tube feeding--and poor weight gain. Later appears insatiable appetite, morbid obesity associated with short stature, dysmorphic syndrome with small hands and behavioural disorders. Although diagnosis is based on clinical features, it must be confirmed by genetic test looking for the characteristic deletion of the chromosome 15q11-q13 region. PWS is the first example in humans of genetic imprinting.

To date, obesity research focuses heavily on the associated physical problems and the identification of effective treatments. While an array of behavioral, pharmacological and surgical treatments has been developed, their ability to demonstrate long-term weight losses is not convincing. Thus, there has been a shift towards the identification of psychological and social factors that may assist in the prediction of successful treatments, most notably in the surgical treatment of obesity. As a result, less emphasis has been placed on post-treatment psychosocial influences. As the treatment of obesity becomes increasing multidimensional, the need for attention to psychosocial factors and the involvement of mental health providers increases. For the allied or mental health provider, a comprehensive understanding of obesity's physical, psychological and social basis is vital to ensure proper assessment or treatment, as it is warranted.","['Davin, Sara A', 'Taylor, Nicole M']","['Davin SA', 'Taylor NM']","['Department of Psychology, University of Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN 46227, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Psychol Health Med,"Psychology, health & medicine",9604099,['0 (Psychotropic Drugs)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bariatric Surgery/statistics & numerical data', 'Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Obesity/*psychology/*surgery', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics & numerical data', 'Psychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use', 'Quality of Life/psychology', 'Social Alienation', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2010/02/26 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2010/02/26 06:00'],"['2010/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['919141492 [pii]', '10.1080/13548500903431501 [doi]']",ppublish,Psychol Health Med. 2009 Dec;14(6):716-25. doi: 10.1080/13548500903431501.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, obesity's impact on in vitro fertilization (IVF) is inconclusive and there is little data concerning poor ovarian responders (POR). This study explored the effects of overweight and obesity on IVF outcomes of POR. Design. We retrospectively evaluated 188 POR undergoing IVF cycles. METHODS: Patients were categorized into three groups. Group 1 was normal weight POR (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2), n = 96); Group 2 was overweight POR (25.0-29.9 kg/m(2), n = 52); and Group 3 was obese POR (>/=30.0 kg/m(2), n = 40). Main measured outcomes included IVF outcomes. RESULTS: The oocyte maturity, total gonadotropin dose-duration, and cycle cancellation rates were similar. Obese women had significantly decreased LH levels. LH < 4 mIU/mL had a sensitivity (62%) and a specificity (86%) for IVF failure (AUC: 0.71). Fertilization rates of obese subjects were significantly lower than normal and overweight subjects (p = 0.04). Obese women's clinical pregnancy rates were significantly lower (15%) than normal weight women (33.3%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar counts of recruited mature oocytes, obese POR women had decreased fertilization and clinical pregnancy rates.

Particularly alarming is the link between obesity and the development of chronic disorders such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and some cancers (Bjorntorp, 1997). Environmental causes of obesity are thought to include a sedentary lifestyle and an abundance of highly palatable energy-dense foods (Hill et al. 2003). Genetic factors also contribute to susceptibility to obesity, although the genetic basis of most human obesities is thought to be polygenic (Comuzzie & Allison, 1998; Barsh et al. 2000).

We used individual data from the Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors Two-Township Study survey and medical use and expenditures data from the Bureau of National Health Insurance (NHI) of Taiwan. By adopting the prevalence-based and population attributable risk (PAR) approaches, direct costs of obesity for six kinds of obesity related metabolic syndrome diseases have been estimated. Comorbidities used in our analysis included ischemic heart diseases, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease accident, diabetes, hyper-cholesterolaemia and hypertension. The results indicate that overweight and obesity are associated with a higher prevalence and costs of the metabolic syndrome related diseases. PAR increases as the obese [body mass index (BMI)] prevalence increases. About 4-9% of the costs of those diseases can be attributed to overweight (24 < or = BMI < 27) and about 7-13% and 8-19% of such costs are attributable to the first and second degree obesity (27 < or = BMI < 30 and BMI > or = 30). The cost of obesity derived from the PAR and medical costs of metabolic syndrome diseases accounts for 2.9% of the national total healthcare expenditure. We therefore conclude that overweight and obesity have increased health costs and resulted in higher prevalence of and greater costs from metabolic syndrome related diseases in Taiwan. These findings provide important support for implementing obesity prevention programs in Taiwan.","['Fu, T', 'Wen, T', 'Yeh, P', 'Chang, H']","['Fu T', 'Wen T', 'Yeh P', 'Chang H']","['Institute of Economics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. tfu@econ.sinica.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Obes Rev,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,100897395,,IM,"['Adult', '*Cost of Illness', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome/*economics/etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/complications/*economics', 'Risk', 'Taiwan']",,,,,2008/03/01 09:00,2008/04/26 09:00,['2008/03/01 09:00'],"['2008/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['OBR441 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00441.x [doi]']",ppublish,Obes Rev. 2008 Mar;9 Suppl 1:68-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00441.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of support and posture minimizing the effect of obesity should be considered when attempting to improve the work tolerance of obese patients. One cannot predict accurately the O2 cost of exercise in the obese patient from the ergometer load because of uncertainties of distribution of the adipose tissue, the uncertain effects on breathing work, and often reduced motor efficiency or skill. The metabolic cost of exercise in the obese patient, therefore, needs to be directly measured; only then can one establish the degree of normality of the physiologic responses to exercise, e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, and minute ventilation.","['Whipp, B J', 'Davis, J A']","['Whipp BJ', 'Davis JA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am Rev Respir Dis,The American review of respiratory disease,0370523,,IM,"['Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/complications/metabolism/*physiopathology', '*Physical Exertion', '*Respiration', 'Respiration Disorders/etiology', 'Stress, Mechanical']",,,,,1984/02/01 00:00,1984/02/01 00:01,['1984/02/01 00:00'],"['1984/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1164/arrd.1984.129.2P2.S90 [doi]'],ppublish,Am Rev Respir Dis. 1984 Feb;129(2 Pt 2):S90-2. doi: 10.1164/arrd.1984.129.2P2.S90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NASA: 84126302'],,,,,,,

We use a web-based, randomized experiment with a nationally representative sample of American adults (n = 718) to test hypotheses derived from theory and research on narrative persuasion. Respondents exposed to narratives that acknowledged individual responsibility while emphasizing obesity's social determinants were less likely to engage in counterargument and felt more empathy for the story's main character than those exposed to a message that did not acknowledge individual responsibility. Counterarguing and affective empathy fully mediated the relationship between message condition and support for policies to reduce rates of obesity. Failure to acknowledge individual responsibility in narratives emphasizing social determinants of obesity may undermine the persuasiveness of policy narratives. Omitting information about individual responsibility, a strongly-held American value, invites the public to engage in counterargument about the narratives and reduces feelings of empathy for a character that experiences the challenges and benefits of social determinants of obesity.","['Niederdeppe, Jeff', 'Roh, Sungjong', 'Shapiro, Michael A']","['Niederdeppe J', 'Roh S', 'Shapiro MA']","['Department of Communication, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Communication, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Communication, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['*Health Policy', 'Humans', 'Narration', 'Obesity/epidemiology/*prevention & control', '*Social Responsibility', '*Socioeconomic Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC4338108,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2015/02/24 06:00,2016/01/09 06:00,['2015/02/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-14-38923 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0117565 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Feb 23;10(2):e0117565. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0117565. eCollection 2015.,,20150223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, the number of intensive care patients suffering additionally from a significant obesity is also increasing continuously. Some particular features of these patients need to be observed. Differences to normal-weight patients involve, for example, respiratory physiology: the obesity leads to a decrease of lung volume and to a marked increase in breathing work as well as oxygen consumption. Clinically relevant changes occur in the upper airways and neck. Thus, mask ventilation, intubation or surgical interventions to secure the airways are clearly more difficult than in normal-weight patients. Obese intensive care patients are therefore primarily to be considered as patients with difficult airway conditions. In addition in cases of extreme obesity, drug distribution, degradation and excretion can differ from those of normal-weight patients. This must be taken into account for medication dosing. In spite of the overweight, obese patients may be undernourished upon admission to the ICU. Thus, for this group of patients also, enteral nutrition should be started as early as possible. Although obesity is accompanied by a higher mortality on account of the many possible comorbidities, numerous studies have confirmed that even extreme obesity does not increase the mortality rate in comparison with that of normal-weight patients.","['Bone, Hans-Georg', 'Freyhoff, Jorg', 'Utech, Markus']","['Bone HG', 'Freyhoff J', 'Utech M']",,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Anasthesiol Intensivmed Notfallmed Schmerzther,"Anasthesiologie, Intensivmedizin, Notfallmedizin, Schmerztherapie : AINS",9109478,,IM,"['Bariatric Surgery/*methods', 'Critical Care/*methods', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Obesity/*complications/epidemiology/surgery/*therapy', 'Obesity, Morbid/surgery', 'Perioperative Care', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,2014/05/28 06:00,2015/01/06 06:00,['2014/05/28 06:00'],"['2014/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0034-1376446 [doi]'],ppublish,Anasthesiol Intensivmed Notfallmed Schmerzther. 2014 May;49(5):288-96. doi: 10.1055/s-0034-1376446.

Adolescent obesity is epidemic, and it is a complex integration of social, psychological, and physical factors that exacerbate the turbulent transitional years of adolescence. Adolescents are vulnerable to issues related to weight, and they are at risk for suffering obesity's negative effects, thereby resulting in unfortunate school outcomes such as decreased rates of attendance, poor academic performance, and school suspensions. Disparities related to overweight and obesity exist; therefore, the negative effects of obesity may disproportionately affect minorities and poor schoolchildren.

Since its relaunch, DTM has received more than 386,000 page views from approximately 110,000 unique visitors. However, the potential exists for more widespread use of DTM if more public health practitioners understood what the site offered and how others have used it in the field. Here, we explain how public health practitioners can explore the most recent state-level data on nutrition, physical activity, breastfeeding, and obesity and use this data to inform programmatic and policy efforts to prevent and control chronic diseases. We demonstrate 3 different ways practitioners can visualize data (ie, Explore by Location, Explore by Topic, and the Open Data Portal) and present 3 real-world examples to highlight DTM's utility as a public health tool.","['Lange, Samantha J', 'Moore, Latetia V', 'Galuska, Deborah A']","['Lange SJ', 'Moore LV', 'Galuska DA']","['Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, Research Participation Program, Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770 Buford Highway NE, Mailstop S107-5, Atlanta, GA 30341.

However, obese animals have many similar traits in common. They are all hyperinsulinemic, an abnormality that occurs early in the development of these syndromes and appears to be of prime importance in producing most of the metabolic changes observed both in the early and late phases of the obesity syndromes. In all instances, obesity is an evolutional syndrome in which the early phase is different from the later one. The early phase is principally characterized by increased hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) output, increased adipose tissue lipogenesis and VLDL uptake, hence, increased fat accretion and fat cell size. These abnormalities are secondary to hyperinsulinemia and can be reversed toward normal by normalizing circulating insulin levels. The late phase is characterized by the continuation of the disorders of the early one plus a superimposed abnormality, the insulin resistance state, that is detectable particularly at the level of adipose and muscle tissues, and eventually brings about hyperglycemia. Insulin resistance is a multifactorial pathological condition that includes at least: (a) a decrease (more or less marked) in insulin binding to target tissues that is responsible for the decrease in tissue sensitivity to the hormone; (b) intracellular defects that are probably responsible for the decreased insulin responsiveness of target tissues. The origin of hyperinsulinemia in animal obesities is still ill-defined. Lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) produce rapid and lasting hyperinsulinemia. Such lesions produce, in addition, increased secretion of insulin and glucagon and changes in pancreatic insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin content in subsequently perfused pancreases. The locus responsible for these effects is not defined and may actually involve a series of interrelated loci. Whatever the latter may be, one of the routes of CNS influence upon endocrine pancreas is the vagus nerve, although a humoral factor has also been claimed. The etiology of hyperinsulinemia in genetically obese animals is unknown. Genetic inheritance could bear primarily upon some hypothalamic or other CNS sites, with secondary alterations in the endocrine pancreas function, or primarily on the islets of Langerhans with possible alteration in the respective function of the A, B, and D cells with resulting excessive insulin secretion.","['Jeanrenaud, B']",['Jeanrenaud B'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Metabolism,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,0375267,['0 (Insulin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Glycolysis', 'Hyperinsulinism/*blood/complications', 'Insulin/*blood', 'Mice', 'Mice, Obese', 'Muscles/metabolism', 'Obesity/*blood/complications/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Syndrome']",,,,,1978/12/01 00:00,1978/12/01 00:01,['1978/12/01 00:00'],"['1978/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0026-0495(78)90244-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0026-0495(78)80006-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Metabolism. 1978 Dec;27(12 Suppl 2):1881-92. doi: 10.1016/s0026-0495(78)80006-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, we hypothesized that clinicians had assigned obese patients a greater ASA-PS score before obesity became an ""official"" criterion in 2015. METHODS: Basic demographic and physical details were collected on patients receiving anesthetics in the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System between 1986 and 2010. The risk ratio (RR) of ""up-coding"" ASA-PS classification assignments was calculated for patients of varying body mass index (BMI). We specifically focused on the subset of patients aged 20-29 yr in whom the medical sequelae of obesity would not yet likely be manifest. RESULTS: Among a total of 194,698 patients, the percentage who were obese increased from 20% to 39% between 1986 and 2010. Obese patients of all ages were more likely than non-obese patients to be classified as ASA-PS II-IV rather than ASA-PS I. The RR and ratio of RR analyses indicated a consistent pattern of up-coding patients with greater BMI (contingency table Chi-square: P < 0.001). Most notably, relative to patients with a normal BMI, young obese patients aged 20-29 yr had an increased likelihood of up-coding in ASA-PS compared with obese patients in the older cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a consistent and temporally stable practice of up-coding obese patients despite this lack of explicit guidance. The ASA House of Delegates' recent decision to specifically mention obesity reinforces long-existing practices regarding ASA-PS coding and will likely not degrade the validity of data sets collected before the change.","['Guerry, Christopher', 'Butterworth, John F 4th']","['Guerry C', 'Butterworth JF 4th']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, VCU, P.O.

On the other hand, microRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play key roles in the post-transcriptional regulation gene expression by suppressing translation and protein synthesis. We examined the association between obesity-related miRNAs and gene expression in gingival tissue using miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) pairing analysis in an obese rat model. METHODS: Sixteen male Wistar rats aged 8 weeks old were divided into two groups: the control group was fed a normal powdered food for 8 weeks, and the obesity group was fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Distance from the cement-enamel junction to the alveolar bone crest of the first molars was measured. miRNA microarray analysis was performed on samples of serum and gingival tissue; the resulting data were used to calculate fold changes in miRNA levels in the obesity group relative to the control group, and miRNA-mRNA pairing analysis was performed to identify mRNAs potentially targeted by miRNAs of interest. RESULTS: Alveolar bone loss in the obesity group exceeded that in the control group (p = .017). miRNA-mRNA pairing analysis identified an association between 4 miRNAs (miR-759, miR-9a-3p, miR-203b-3p, and miR-878) that were differentially expressed in the obesity and control groups and 7 genes (Ly86, Arid5b, Rgs18, Mlana, P2ry13, Kif1b, and Myt1) expressed in gingival tissue. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that several miRNAs play an important role in the mechanism of periodontal disease progression induced by the obesity.","['Maruyama, Takayuki', 'Kobayashi, Terumasa', 'Sugiura, Yoshio', 'Yoneda, Toshiki', 'Ekuni, Daisuke', 'Morita, Manabu']","['Maruyama T', 'Kobayashi T', 'Sugiura Y', 'Yoneda T', 'Ekuni D', 'Morita M']","['Department of Preventive Dentistry, Okayama University Academic Field of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Advanced Research Center for Oral and Craniofacial Sciences, Okayama University Dental School, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Preventive Dentistry, Okayama University Academic Field of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Preventive Dentistry, Okayama University Academic Field of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Preventive Dentistry, Okayama University Academic Field of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Preventive Dentistry, Okayama University Academic Field of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Preventive Dentistry, Okayama University Academic Field of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Periodontal Res,Journal of periodontal research,0055107,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Male', '*MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Obesity/complications/genetics', '*Periodontitis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",,['NOTNLM'],"['experimental animal model', 'mRNA', 'microRNA', 'obesity', 'periodontitis']",,2022/03/03 06:00,2022/05/25 06:00,['2022/03/02 08:42'],"['2022/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2022/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/25 06:00 [medline]', '2022/03/02 08:42 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jre.12979 [doi]'],ppublish,J Periodontal Res. 2022 Jun;57(3):502-509. doi: 10.1111/jre.12979.

Obesity-related electronic health records can be a useful resource to identify and address obesity. The analysis of real-world data from T82-coded (International Classification of Primary Care coding, for obesity) primary care individuals can be an excellent national source of data on obesity's prevalence, characteristics, and impact on the National Health Service. METHODS: Retrospective longitudinal study, based on a database of electronic medical records, from the Regional Health Administration of northern Portugal. The study objectives were to determine the prevalence of obesity and to characterize an adult obese population in northern Portugal from a bio-demographic point of view along with profiles of comorbidities and the use of health resources. This study used a database of 266,872 patients in December 2019 and screened for diagnostic code T82 from the International Classification of Primary Care. RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity was 10.2% and the highest prevalence of obesity was in the 65-74 age group (16.1%). The most prevalent morbidities in patients with obesity as coded through ICPC-2 were K86 (uncomplicated hypertension), T90 (non-insulin-dependent diabetes), and K87 (complicated hypertension). Descriptive information showed that T82 subjects used more consultations, medications, and diagnostic tests than non-T82 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Routine recording of weight and height deserves special attention to allow obesity recognition at an early stage and move on to the appropriate intervention. Future work is necessary to automate the codification of obesity for subjects under 18 years of age, to raise awareness and anticipate the prevention of problems associated with obesity. Practical strategies need to be implemented, such as the creation of a specific program consultation with truly targeted approaches to obesity.","['Pascoa, Rosalia', 'Teixeira, Andreia', 'Henriques, Teresa S', 'Monteiro, Hugo', 'Monteiro, Rosario', 'Martins, Carlos']","['Pascoa R', 'Teixeira A', 'Henriques TS', 'Monteiro H', 'Monteiro R', 'Martins C']","['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Community Medicine, Information and Health Decision Sciences (MEDCIDS), University of Porto, Al.

This review examines evidence for screening and treating obesity in adults. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and Cochrane Library (January 1994 through February 2003). STUDY SELECTION: Systematic reviews; randomized, controlled trials; and observational studies of obesity's health outcomes or efficacy of obesity treatment. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently abstracted data on study design, sample, sample size, treatment, outcomes, and quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: No trials evaluated mass screening for obesity, so the authors evaluated indirect evidence for efficacy. Pharmacotherapy or counseling interventions produced modest (generally 3 to 5 kg) weight loss over at least 6 or 12 months, respectively. Counseling was most effective when intensive and combined with behavioral therapy. Maintenance strategies helped retain weight loss. Selected surgical patients lost substantial weight (10 to 159 kg over 1 to 5 years). Weight reduction improved blood pressure, lipid levels, and glucose metabolism and decreased diabetes incidence. The internal validity of the treatment trials was fair to good, and external validity was limited by the minimal ethnic or gender diversity of volunteer participants. No data evaluated counseling harms. Primary adverse drug effects included hypertension with sibutramine (mean increase, 0 mm Hg to 3.5 mm Hg) and gastrointestinal distress with orlistat (1% to 37% of patients). Fewer than 1% (pooled samples) of surgical patients died; up to 25% needed surgery again over 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Counseling and pharmacotherapy can promote modest sustained weight loss, improving clinical outcomes. Pharmacotherapy appears safe in the short term; long-term safety has not been as strongly established. In selected patients, surgery promotes large amounts of weight loss with rare but sometimes severe complications.","['McTigue, Kathleen M', 'Harris, Russell', 'Hemphill, Brian', 'Lux, Linda', 'Sutton, Sonya', 'Bunton, Audrina J', 'Lohr, Kathleen N']","['McTigue KM', 'Harris R', 'Hemphill B', 'Lux L', 'Sutton S', 'Bunton AJ', 'Lohr KN']","['University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,,IM,"['Adult', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Counseling', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Humans', '*Mass Screening', 'Obesity/*prevention & control/therapy', 'Observation', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Review Literature as Topic']",,,,,2003/12/04 05:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['139/11/933 [pii]', '10.7326/0003-4819-139-11-200312020-00013 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 2003 Dec 2;139(11):933-49. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-139-11-200312020-00013.,['290-97-0011/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['Ann Intern Med. 2003 Dec 2;139(11):I57.

This study compared bariatric surgery demographics at a large university hospital to that of a broader region's population statistics. From this comparison, an economic model was derived that evaluated, for the state of New Mexico, the cost of obesity in terms of lost business output, employment, and income. METHODS: Between September 2003 and September 2005, we analyzed the charts of all of our patients from New Mexico who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass and laparoscopic banding. Input-output analysis estimate margins, the purchase prices for goods and services, and regional purchase coefficients, the percent of spending by local suppliers, were used to model the regional economy. Collected patient data, used in conjunction with IMPLAN model data, were used to estimate, on a regional basis, an industry-by-industry formulation of input-output accounts to calculate multipliers in order to assess the impact of economic costs of the obese on the general economy. RESULTS: Total labor income impacts are nearly 200 million dollars, 1,660 dollars of output income per household and 245 dollars of labor income per household. Obesity cost New Mexico more than 7,300 jobs and cut state and local tax revenues by more than 48 million dollars. CONCLUSION: Obesity's impact of more than 1.3 billion dollars amounts to 2.5% of New Mexico's gross state product. Governmental measures to combat this menace are warranted.","['Frezza, Eldo E', 'Wachtel, Mitchell S', 'Ewing, Bradley T']","['Frezza EE', 'Wachtel MS', 'Ewing BT']","['Department of Surgery, Division of General Surgery, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas 79415, USA. eldo.frezza@ttuhsc.edu <eldo.frezza@ttuhsc.edu>']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Surg Obes Relat Dis,Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,101233161,,IM,"['Adult', '*Cost of Illness', 'Female', 'Gastric Bypass/*economics', 'Gastroplasty/*economics', '*Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals, University/economics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'New Mexico', 'Obesity, Morbid/*economics/surgery', 'State Government']",,,,,2006/10/04 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/10/04 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1550-7289(06)00740-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.soard.2006.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Surg Obes Relat Dis. 2006 Sep-Oct;2(5):504-8. doi: 10.1016/j.soard.2006.08.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative trait analysis, with simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLPs) at loci previously linked to rodent obesities, identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on Chromosome (Chr) 15, accounting for approximately 9% of the variance in adiposity and 14% of the variance in mesenteric depot size.

Dietary protein mimics obesity's effects on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria and, in certain circumstances, may have the potential to adversely affect kidney function. Here we tested the hypothesis that dietary protein independently explains elevations in the GFR and proteinuria found in obese persons with a normal serum creatinine. Seventeen patients were randomized in a double-blind, crossover fashion for 1-week periods to high (140 g/day) and low (50 g/day) protein diets with a 1-week washout interval separating these periods. High protein consumption was associated with a very modest but significant increase in the GFR of 5 +/- 6 ml/min. Hence, while dietary protein does modulate kidney parameters, it is unlikely to fully account for the elevations in GFR and proteinuria found in obesity.","['Friedman, Allon N', 'Yu, Zhangsheng', 'Juliar, Beth E', 'Nguyen, James T', 'Strother, Matthew', 'Quinney, Sara K', 'Li, Lang', 'Inman, Margaret', 'Gomez, Gerardo', 'Shihabi, Zak', 'Moe, Sharon']","['Friedman AN', 'Yu Z', 'Juliar BE', 'Nguyen JT', 'Strother M', 'Quinney SK', 'Li L', 'Inman M', 'Gomez G', 'Shihabi Z', 'Moe S']","['Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA. allfried@iupui.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Kidney Int,Kidney international,0323470,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Dietary Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dietary Proteins/*administration & dosage', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*physiopathology', 'Kidney Diseases/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/complications/*physiopathology']",,,,,2010/07/29 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0085-2538(15)54603-6 [pii]', '10.1038/ki.2010.184 [doi]']",ppublish,Kidney Int. 2010 Oct;78(7):693-7. doi: 10.1038/ki.2010.184.

Considering that the major cause of most human obesities is the modern lifestyle in a rapidly changing environment, this suggests that the battle is between brain areas controlling internal metabolic homeostasis and those dealing with cognitive and emotional processing of external information. Thus, this review is intended to bridge this apparent neural dichotomy and highlight possible ways of interactions between these homeostatic and nonhomeostatic systems. RECENT FINDINGS: Rapid progress has been made in identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying the neural circuits regulating food intake and energy balance. Specific populations of peptidergic neurons in the medial hypothalamus can be considered metabolic integrators sensing both short and long-term availability of fuels. These cell groups in turn connect with various other brain regions to orchestrate adaptive responses through changes in food intake, as well as endocrine and autonomic responses. Alternatively, the impact of the environmental changes on ingestive behavior have been documented, and many of the underlying cortico-limbic pathways are starting to be identified. It has been proposed that a switch from instinctual control of energy balance to a more cognitive control will be necessary to stop the obesity epidemic. SUMMARY: The realization that there is nothing wrong with the homeostatic regulatory system in common obesity suggests that a systematic investigation of pathways that link the 'cognitive' with the 'metabolic' brain might be a more promising area of research. Such an investigation would reveal new molecular and cellular mechanisms providing new drug targets, leading to behavioral therapies that are directed more towards the causes of common obesity.","['Berthoud, Hans-Rudolf']",['Berthoud HR'],"['Pennington Biomedical Research Center, 6400 Perkins Road, Baton Rouge, LA 70808, USA. berthohr@pbrc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,9804399,,IM,"['*Developed Countries', '*Diet', 'Energy Metabolism/*physiology', 'Food Preferences/physiology', 'Homeostasis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamus, Middle/*physiology', 'Models, Neurological', 'Neural Pathways/physiology', 'Obesity/*etiology/physiopathology']",,,,,2003/10/15 05:00,2004/05/20 05:00,['2003/10/15 05:00'],"['2003/10/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00075197-200311000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care. 2003 Nov;6(6):615-20. doi: 10.1097/00075197-200311000-00002.,,,,,,,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Utility indices reduce QOL measurements to a single numerical value that can be used in the calculation of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years and the cost effectiveness for obesity treatment. The purpose of this investigation is to assess the sensitivity of the Health and Activities Limitation Index (HALex) utility index to obesity. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The answers to five questions regarding an individual's self-perception of his or her health status and information about limitation in daily and work activities were collected from 32,440 adults in the 1998 National Health Information Survey. Answers to the questions were scored and converted to a utility index score ranging from 0 (near-death state) to 1 (perfect health) with no limitations. Average values for indices corresponding to differing body mass indices were obtained and significance determined by ANOVA. RESULTS: The utility index for normal weight males and females was 0.86 +/- 0.19 and fell to 0.68 +/- 0.27 for superobese males and 0.60 +/- 0.28 in superobese females. Utility indices fell linearly with increasing body mass index and were lower for respondents having obesity-related comorbid conditions known to reduce the quality of life. DISCUSSION: There is a statistically significant decrease in the QOL with increasing obesity, slightly worse for women compared with men. The Health and Activities Limitation Index can quantitate the effect obesity and its complications have on quality of life.","['Livingston, Edward H', 'Ko, Clifford Y']","['Livingston EH', 'Ko CY']","['Department of Surgery, Veterans Administration Greater Los Angeles Health Care System, Los Angeles, California, USA. elivingston@mednet.ucla.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Obes Res,Obesity research,9305691,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Body Mass Index', 'Emotions', 'Female', '*Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/classification/*physiopathology/psychology', '*Quality of Life', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Work']",,,,,2002/08/16 10:00,2003/01/31 04:00,['2002/08/16 10:00'],"['2002/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/oby.2002.111 [doi]'],ppublish,Obes Res. 2002 Aug;10(8):824-32. doi: 10.1038/oby.2002.111.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All four medial cell groups contain leptin receptors. To determine which of these cell groups normally mediates the effects of leptin on food intake and body weight gain, we injected colchicine bilaterally into each nucleus and determined the pathophysiological effects of disruption and responsivity to leptin injected intracerebroventricularly. Intracerebroventricular injections of leptin in sham-lesioned rats decreased food intake during the dark period, but not during the light period. Lesions of the arcuate (ARC), paraventricular (PVN), and ventromedial (VMN) nuclei all resulted in leptin insensitivity; by contrast, lesions of the dorsomedial nuclei (DMN) augmented sensitivity to leptin on feeding and body weight gain. Although rats with ARC and PVN lesions were obese, they were still capable of reducing caloric efficiency over the 5 days of study and increasing uncoupling protein content in interscapular brown adipose tissue. Caloric efficiency and uncoupling protein content were unchanged in rats with VMN and DMN lesions. Finally, the slope of the relationship between leptin and mesenteric white adipose tissue was increased in rats with VMN lesions and abolished in rats with ARC lesions. Thus, lesions of the ARC, PVN, and VMN produced obesity via separate pathways. We conclude that the medial hypothalamic cell groups, each with a different role in energy balance, are all necessary for normal leptin responsiveness.","['Choi, S', 'Sparks, R', 'Clay, M', 'Dallman, M F']","['Choi S', 'Sparks R', 'Clay M', 'Dallman MF']","['Department of Physiology, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0444, USA. suchoi@itsa.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Leptin)', '0 (Proteins)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Colchicine', 'Dorsomedial Hypothalamic Nucleus/drug effects', 'Eating/drug effects', 'Hypothalamic Diseases/chemically induced/*complications', 'Injections, Intraventricular', 'Leptin', 'Male', 'Obesity/*etiology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Proteins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Ventromedial Hypothalamic Nucleus/drug effects']",,,,,1999/09/28 00:00,1999/09/28 00:01,['1999/09/28 00:00'],"['1999/09/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.140.10.7064 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1999 Oct;140(10):4426-33. doi: 10.1210/endo.140.10.7064.,"['2-R25-MH-18910/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-09519/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-28172/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of adipsin messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein was analyzed in rodents during metabolic perturbations and in several experimental models of obesity. Adipsin mRNA abundance is increased in adipose tissue during fasting in normal rats and in diabetes due to streptozotocin-induced insulin deficiency. Adipsin mRNA abundance decreased during the continuous infusion of glucose, which induces a hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic state that is accompanied by an increased adipose mass; it is suppressed (greater than 100-fold) in two strains of genetically obese mice (db/db and ob/ob), compared to their congenic counterparts, and is also reduced when obesity is induced chemically by injection of monosodium glutamate into newborn mice. Circulating adipsin protein is decreased in these animal models of obesity, as determined by immunoblotting with antisera to adipsin. Little change in adipsin expression is observed in a model of obesity obtained by pure overfeeding of normal rats (cafeteria model). These data suggest a possible role for adipsin in the above-mentioned disordered metabolic states, and raise the possibility that adipsin expression may be used to distinguish obesities that arise from certain genetic or metabolic defects from those that result from pure overfeeding.","['Flier, J S', 'Cook, K S', 'Usher, P', 'Spiegelman, B M']","['Flier JS', 'Cook KS', 'Usher P', 'Spiegelman BM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.46 (Complement Factor D)', 'EC 3.4.21.46 (complement factor D, mouse)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/enzymology', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Complement Factor D', 'Endopeptidases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Immune Sera', 'Mice', 'Mice, Obese', 'Obesity/*enzymology/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reference Values', '*Serine Endopeptidases', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,,,,1987/07/24 00:00,1987/07/24 00:01,['1987/07/24 00:00'],"['1987/07/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/24 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.3299706 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1987 Jul 24;237(4813):405-8. doi: 10.1126/science.3299706.,"['AM28082/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM31405/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK34605/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both professionals and researchers agree that treatment must also have a multifactorial approach, including diet, physical activity, pharmacology and/or surgical treatment. These two last ones should be reserved for those cases of morbid obesities or in case of failure of the previous ones. The aim of the PRONAF study is to determine what type of exercise combined with caloric restriction is the most appropriate to be included in overweigth and obesity intervention programs, and the aim of this paper is to describe the design and the evaluation methods used to carry out the PRONAF study. METHODS/DESIGN: One-hundred nineteen overweight (46 males) and 120 obese (61 males) subjects aged 18-50 years were randomly assigned to a strength training group, an endurance training group, a combined strength + endurance training group or a diet and physical activity recommendations group. The intervention period was 22 weeks (in all cases 3 times/wk of training for 22 weeks and 2 weeks for pre and post evaluation). All subjects followed a hypocaloric diet (25-30% less energy intake than the daily energy expenditure estimated by accelerometry). 29-34% of the total energy intake came from fat, 14-20% from protein, and 50-55% from carbohydrates. The mayor outcome variables assesed were, biochemical and inflamatory markers, body composition, energy balance, physical fitness, nutritional habits, genetic profile and quality of life. 180 (75.3%) subjects finished the study, with a dropout rate of 24.7%. Dropout reasons included: personal reasons 17 (28.8%), low adherence to exercise 3 (5.1%), low adherence to diet 6 (10.2%), job change 6 (10.2%), and lost interest 27 (45.8%). DISCUSSION: Feasibility of the study has been proven, with a low dropout rate which corresponds to the estimated sample size. Transfer of knowledge is foreseen as a spin-off, in order that overweight and obese subjects can benefit from the results. The aim is to transfer it to sports centres. Effectiveness on individual health-related parameter in order to determine the most effective training programme will be analysed in forthcoming publications.

A critical discussion of two arguments against the use of animals in obesity research.,320-4,10.1136/medethics-2011-100368 [doi],"Animal use in medical research is widely accepted on the basis that it may help to save human lives and improve their quality of life. Recently, however, objections have been made specifically to the use of animals in scientific investigation of human obesity. This paper discusses two arguments for the view that this form of animal use, unlike some other forms of animal-based medical research, cannot be defended. The first argument leans heavily on the notion that people themselves are responsible for developing obesity and so-called 'lifestyle' diseases; the second involves the claim that animal studies of obesity's causes and therapies distract attention from preventive efforts. Drawing on both empirical data and moral reasoning, we argue that the relevant attributions of responsibility and claims about distraction are not plausible, and that, therefore, there is no reason to single out the use of animals in obesity research as especially problematic.","['Lund, Thomas Boker', 'Sorensen, Thorkild I A', 'Olsson, I Anna S', 'Hansen, Axel Kornerup', 'Sandoe, Peter']","['Lund TB', 'Sorensen TI', 'Olsson IA', 'Hansen AK', 'Sandoe P']","['Department of Food and Resource Economics, University of Copenhagen, , Frederiksberg, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Med Ethics,Journal of medical ethics,7513619,,IM,"['Animal Experimentation/*ethics', 'Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Ethics, Research', 'Humans', '*Life Style', '*Obesity/prevention & control/therapy', '*Personal Autonomy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Social Responsibility']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Animal Experimentation', 'Public Policy', 'Research Ethics']",,2013/05/28 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['medethics-2011-100368 [pii]', '10.1136/medethics-2011-100368 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Ethics. 2014 May;40(5):320-4. doi: 10.1136/medethics-2011-100368.

RESULTS: Obese patients demonstrated an increased frequency of CD3+CD4+ T-cells (mean difference 12%, P=0.004), a decreased frequency of CD3+CD8+ T-cells (mean difference 9.4%, P=0.016) and an increased frequency of CD3+CD8+CD95+ T-cells (mean difference 13.3%, P=0.032). No other differences among T-cell or monocyte subsets were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is associated with alterations in frequencies of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and aberrations in the expression of CD95 among CD8+ T-cells. These data suggest both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell compartments, as well as the regulation of CD95 expression on CD8+ T-cells, as targets for further study into obesity's effects on the immune system.","[""O'Rourke, Robert W"", 'Kay, Thomas', 'Scholz, Mark H', 'Diggs, Brian', 'Jobe, Blair A', 'Lewinsohn, David M', 'Bakke, Antony C']","[""O'Rourke RW"", 'Kay T', 'Scholz MH', 'Diggs B', 'Jobe BA', 'Lewinsohn DM', 'Bakke AC']","['Department of Surgery, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA. orourkro@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Obes Surg,Obesity surgery,9106714,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*blood', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity, Morbid/*blood/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*metabolism']",,,,,2005/12/16 09:00,2006/04/21 09:00,['2005/12/16 09:00'],"['2005/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1381/096089205774859308 [doi]'],ppublish,Obes Surg. 2005 Nov-Dec;15(10):1463-8. doi: 10.1381/096089205774859308.,['5 M01 RR000334/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tissular distribution of drugs may depend on the obesity-induced changes in the body composition taking into account the degree of drug liposolubility. Some other factors such as protein binding and regional blood flow may also be involved in tissular diffusion of drugs in obesity. Drug binding to albumin does not seem to be modified in obesity. On the contrary, the protein binding of some basic drugs is increased because of the rise of the plasma alpha 1 glycoprotein acid levels in obesity. Although the cardiac output and the total blood volume are increased in obese patients, the blood flow recalculated according to the adipose tissue weight, is less than in non obese subjects: this point could reduce the diffusion of some lipophilic drugs. More complex are the obesity induced changes in the hepatic clearance of drugs: some reactions such as oxydo-reduction and acetylation do not vary, some others such as sulfoconjugation or glucuronoconjugation are increased. The renal clearance is increased for drugs totally eliminated by glomerular filtration and for drugs which are both filtrated and secreted. According to the liposolubility characteristic of a drug and its clearance, one can calculate the loading dose and the maintenance dose.","['Girardin, E', 'Bruguerolle, B']","['Girardin E', 'Bruguerolle B']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Faculte de Medecine, Marseille.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Therapie,Therapie,0420544,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/drug therapy/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Pharmacokinetics', 'Tissue Distribution']",,,,,1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Therapie. 1993 Jul-Aug;48(4):397-402.,,,,,,,,,"Modifications, pharmacocinetiques dans l'obesite.",,,,,,,,,,,

Primary and high schools (N = 47) were recruited from every state and territory of Australia and included 7889 children from government, private and Catholic schools (82% response rate) in August-November, 2006. The socioeconomic status (SES) of schools was based on a government survey of total family income. A questionnaire completed by students, measured demographic details of gender, age, weight perceptions and ethnic/cultural background. Height and weight were measured by trained research assistants. Outcome measures included body mass index (BMI), prevalence of obesity, overweight, weight perceptions. Prevalence of obesity was 6.4% of males and 5.6% of females in primary school students (P = 0.34). More high school males were obese than females (7.7% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.001). Obesity was more prevalent among students from Pacific Islander backgrounds. Adolescents who were most likely to be obese were boys and girls of low SES or Pacific Islander or Middle Eastern/Arabic background. The least likely to be obese were Anglo/Caucasian or Asian students and in particular, the girls. Obese female adolescents from Aboriginal, Middle Eastern/Arabic and Pacific Islander backgrounds were less likely than their Caucasian or Asian peers to perceive themselves as 'too fat'.Those working in clinical, community or educational settings with young people and in particular, obese young people, should be aware that obesity is likely to be more prevalent, more culturally acceptable and perhaps more desirable among children and teens from low SES communities and/or Middle Eastern and Pacific Islander backgrounds. Health and social work professionals should be careful not to exaggerate the risks of overweight or obesity or inadvertently create weight concerns among young people. The different body image perceptions identified in this study should be taken into account when planning clinical, community or preventive initiatives among children or adolescents from varying ethnic groups.","[""O'Dea, Jennifer A""]","[""O'Dea JA""]","[""Faculty of Education & Social Work, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia. j.o'dea@edfac.usyd.edu.au""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Health Soc Care Community,Health & social care in the community,9306359,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Attitude to Health', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Body Image', 'Child', '*Culture', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/epidemiology/*ethnology/prevention & control/therapy', '*Social Class', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,,,2008/03/11 09:00,2008/06/18 09:00,['2008/03/11 09:00'],"['2008/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['HSC768 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2524.2008.00768.x [doi]']",ppublish,Health Soc Care Community. 2008 May;16(3):282-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2524.2008.00768.x.

This obesity was observed in the inbred DW strain of mice at the Institut Pasteur-France, and is due to a recessive mutation on chromosome 4 at the diabetes locus. The mice became grossly obese, gaining weight until at least 16 mo of age. By 6 mo of age they exhibited hyperphagia, hypercholesterolemia, severe hyperinsulinemia, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of adipocytes, and impaired fertility. In contrast with other diabetic strains of mice, glycemia was normal in females and slightly elevated in males. This result indicates that the mutation of the db locus does not necessarily lead to a frank diabetes. Body temperature was normal either at 22 degrees C or after a cold exposure at 4 degrees C. GDP (guanosine diphosphate) binding to brown adipose tissue mitochondria was normal in obese mice as compared to lean. These data differentiate this model from other genetic obesities in mice and rats. This new model of genetic obesity offers interesting characteristics for the study of obesity.","['Aubert, R', 'Herzog, J', 'Camus, M C', 'Guenet, J L', 'Lemonnier, D']","['Aubert R', 'Herzog J', 'Camus MC', 'Guenet JL', 'Lemonnier D']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,['0 (Insulin)'],IM,"['Adipose Tissue/cytology', 'Animals', 'Body Temperature Regulation', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Insulin/blood', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Obese/blood/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Obesity/blood/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,,1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jn/115.3.327 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nutr. 1985 Mar;115(3):327-33. doi: 10.1093/jn/115.3.327.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The heritability of fat mass or percent body fat derived from underwater-weighing assessment of body density reaches approximately 25% of the age- and gender-adjusted phenotypic variance. The within-identical-twin-pair resemblance in the response to a standardized overfeeding protocol emphasizes the importance of the genotype in determining individual differences in body weight and body composition.

These studies show, in rats eating a high-fat diet, that differences in norepinephrine turnover, particularly in brown adipose tissue, may play an important role in whether dietary obesity develops and in the manifestations of resistance to this phenomenon observed in the S 5B/Pl rat.","['Yoshida, T', 'Fisler, J S', 'Fukushima, M', 'Bray, G A', 'Schemmel, R A']","['Yoshida T', 'Fisler JS', 'Fukushima M', 'Bray GA', 'Schemmel RA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,['X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', '*Diet/adverse effects', '*Eating', 'Female', '*Lighting', 'Norepinephrine/*metabolism', 'Obesity/blood/etiology/*metabolism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",,,,,1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpregu.1987.252.2.R402 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1987 Feb;252(2 Pt 2):R402-8. doi: 10.1152/ajpregu.1987.252.2.R402.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These abnormalities appear to be related primarily to hyperinsulinemia as they are reversed to or toward normal when hyperinsulinemia is corrected or, conversely, as they develop concomitantly with hyperinsulinemia. In the liver (ob/ob mice), another defect can be demonstrated, i.e. a decreased hepatic insulin clearance. This defect is also related to hyperinsulinemia and is markedly reduced upon normalizing hyperinsulinemia of obese mice. Hyperinsulinemia may thus be a key feature of the obesity syndromes, and bring about most of the abnormalities noted, including the subsequent state of insulin resistance known to exist in obese animals. The etiology of hyperinsulinemia of genetically obese animals is still unknown. Among the possible mechanisms one should cite possible primary dysfunction of the pancreas, possible primary dysregulation, by the hypothalamus, of overall endocrine pancreas activity.","['Jeanrenaud, B']",['Jeanrenaud B'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Ann Nutr Aliment,Annales de la nutrition et de l'alimentation,0372653,"['0 (Insulin)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Hypothalamus/injuries', 'Insulin/blood/metabolism', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Islets of Langerhans/physiopathology', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Obese', '*Obesity/etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats']",,,,,1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Nutr Aliment. 1979;33(1):27-38.,,,,,,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At this examination, school medical officers rated the boys and girls into one of the following categories: grossly obese, moderately obese, normal, thin or very thin. A comparison is made between doctors' rating and assessment of obesity by relative weight (RW). Obesity was defined as RW greater than 120. Overall 803 (15.2 per cent) girls were rated obese by doctors compared with 469 (8.9 per cent) identified by RW. Only 414 (7.8 per cent) girls were considered obese by both methods. In boys the difference between the two methods was less marked. There were 362 (6.4 per cent) boys rated as obese by doctors, 404 (7.2 per cent) by relative weight and 262 (4.6 per cent) by both methods. The discrepancies demonstrate that one method of assessment cannot replace another. Doctors' rated considerably more girls than boys as obese. Although at this age girls were heavier than boys for a given height, the doctors' rating may also reflect the different attitudes towards obesity in men and women which are prevalent in our society. Without comparison with a more accurate measure of adiposity it is not possible to reach a definite conclusion as to whether clinical assessment, relative weight, or indeed both methods combined are the most suitable for identifying obese adolescents.","['Moynihan, C M', 'Stark, O', 'Peckham, C S']","['Moynihan CM', 'Stark O', 'Peckham CS']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Obes,International journal of obesity,7703240,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Height', 'Body Weight', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/classification/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'United Kingdom']",,,,,1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Obes. 1986;10(1):3-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obesity prevalence is increasing since thirty years and the treatment of obesities is particularly necessary to solve this public health and economical problem. The receptors of numerous hypothalamic neuropeptides are potential targets for such drug treatments. Hormones of the gastro-intestinal tract or produced by the adipose tissue directly interact with these central pathways to regulate feeding behavior. The use of leptin, an adipose tissue hormone that inhibits food intake, has not been conclusive because of the development of leptin resistance in obese subjects. Similar disappointing results have been obtained with antagonists of neuropeptide Y (NPY), one of the most potent orexigenic peptide. This was linked to the complexity and redundancy of the circuits involved in feeding regulation. Consequently, a multitherapy targeting several pathways simultaneously is probably the best option to cure obesity. Among these pathways, PYY 3-36 has been tested in man and some encouraging data have been obtained in animals with antagonists of some other orexigenic peptides such as orexins and melanin-concentrating hormone. A few gene therapy trials in the rat brain have restored interest for the leptin and NPY pathways. Their general use is however not planed in a next future. According to the type of obesity, these new treatments might be associated with either current (or almost current) drugs acting either on serotoninergic/catecholaminergic or cannabinoid pathways, or with surgery. Behavioral changes (food intake, exercise) and preventive actions during early life (in utero, young children) will remain for a while the best solutions to limit overweight development. The new treatments will help obese people to adhere to these behavioral changes by improving their efficiency to induce weight loss.","['Beck, Bernard']",['Beck B'],"['INSERM U724 et UHP/Neurocal, Faculte de Medecine, 9, avenue de la Foret de Haye BP 184, 54505 Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.

Both periodic components can be investigated by chronobiometric procedures by combining the Cosinor method with spectral analysis. A 24-hour profile of hunger sensation (HS) can be plotted on a 1-to-10 scale of intensity using self-rated scores performed every half-hour of the day. Circadian and ultradian components were studied in 60 patients affected by essential obesity (20 men and 40 women; mean age, 38.4 years; mean body weight, 101 kg) before and after treatment with dexfenfluramine (Isomeride; Servier, Orleans, France) 15 mg orally twice daily, for 30 days. The control group consisted of 30 clinically healthy subjects (15 men and 15 women; mean age, 37.5 years; mean body weight, 69 kg). Chronobiometric analysis shows three patterns in obese patients, which suggests that HS may be normal (eurectic obesity), exaggerated (hyperrectic obesity), or diminished (hyporectic obesity). After dexfenfluramine administration, HS was showed a substantial decrease in the daily mean level. The spectrum of resolution in circadian and ultradian components was found to be maintained in eurectic obesity and partially readjusted in hyperrectic and hyporectic obesities. This demonstrates that dexfenfluramine acts not only as an anorectic but also as a chronizer by interfering with the recursive components of HS. The anorectic and chronizing effects suggest that dexfenfluramine is a ""chronoanorectic drug"" that interacts with the chronobiologic properties of the serotoninergic system.","['Cugini, P', 'Battisti, P', 'Paggi, A', 'Di Stasio, M E', 'Di Palma, L', 'Morelli, F', 'Pisculli, M', 'Lavielle, R']","['Cugini P', 'Battisti P', 'Paggi A', 'Di Stasio ME', 'Di Palma L', 'Morelli F', 'Pisculli M', 'Lavielle R']","['Institute of Medical Clinic II (Chronobiology Unit), University of Rome La Sapienza, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Metabolism,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,0375267,['2DS058H2CF (Fenfluramine)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Circadian Rhythm', 'Female', 'Fenfluramine/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Hunger', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/drug therapy/*physiopathology']",,,,,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0026-0495(95)90211-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0026-0495(95)90211-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Metabolism. 1995 Feb;44(2 Suppl 2):50-6. doi: 10.1016/0026-0495(95)90211-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effects of dog and owner body weight on veterinarian perceptions and treatment recommendations.,2455-2464,10.1038/s41366-020-0622-7 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Weight bias against persons with obesity impairs health care delivery and utilization and contributes to poorer health outcomes. Despite rising rates of pet obesity (including among dogs), the potential for weight bias in veterinary settings has not been examined. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In two online, 2 x 2 experimental studies, the effects of dog and owner body weight on perceptions and treatment recommendations were investigated in 205 practicing veterinarians (Study 1) and 103 veterinary students (Study 2). In both studies, participants were randomly assigned to view one of four vignettes of a dog and owners with varying weight statuses (lean vs. obesity). Dependent measures included emotion/liking ratings toward the dog and owners; perceived causes of the dog's weight; and treatment recommendations and compliance expectations. Other clinical practices, such as terms to describe excess weight in dogs, were also assessed. RESULTS: Veterinarians and students both reported feeling more blame, frustration, and disgust toward dogs with obesity and their owners than toward lean dogs and their owners (p values < 0.001). Interactions between dog and owner body weight emerged for perceived causes of obesity, such that owners with obesity were perceived as causing the dog with obesity's weight, while lean owners were perceived as causing the lean dog's weight. Participants were pessimistic about treatment compliance from owners of the dog with obesity, and weight loss treatment was recommended for the dog with obesity when presenting with a medical condition ambiguous in its relationship to weight. Veterinarians and students also reported use of stigmatizing terms to describe excess weight in dogs. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this investigation, with replication, have implications for training and practice guidelines in veterinary medicine.","['Pearl, Rebecca L', 'Wadden, Thomas A', 'Bach, Caroline', 'Leonard, Sharon M', 'Michel, Kathryn E']","['Pearl RL', 'Wadden TA', 'Bach C', 'Leonard SM', 'Michel KE']","['Center for Weight and Eating Disorders, Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. rpearl@pennmedicine.upenn.edu.', 'Center for Weight and Eating Disorders, Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Center for Weight and Eating Disorders, Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Center for Weight and Eating Disorders, Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Advanced Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Int J Obes (Lond),International journal of obesity (2005),101256108,,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', '*Body Weight', '*Dogs', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/etiology/*veterinary', 'Ownership', 'Pets', 'Stereotyping', '*Veterinarians']",PMC7686094,,,"['Competing Interests: The authors have no competing interests to disclose.

Data were compared to those obtained from 10 normal volunteers (age 48 +/- 13; p < 0.05, vs. obeses). End-diastolic and stroke volumes did not differ between the two groups, whereas end-systolic volume was significantly higher in obese subjects (67 +/- 20 vs. 49 +/- 20 ml; p < 0.05), and, as a consequence, LV ejection fraction at rest was decreased in obese subjects (59 +/- 7%) compared to normals (65 +/- 6%; p < 0.05). Due to the higher heart rate in obese subjects (81 +/- 13 vs. 69 +/- 10 pbm, respectively; p < 0.05) cardiac output was significantly greater compared to normals (7.1 +/- 0.8 vs. 6.2 +/- 0.2 liters/min, respectively; p < 0.01). During exercise, ejection fraction normally increased in normals (70 +/- 7%; p < 0.001, vs. baseline) but not in obese subjects (60 +/- 9%; p = nonsignificant vs. baseline). In addition, systolic blood pressure/end-systolic volume ratio was significantly decreased in obese subjects (23 +/- 1.3) compared to normals (2.8 +/- 1.6; p < 0.05). Peak filling rate, normalized to end-diastolic counts per second, was significantly lower in obese subjects (2.2 +/- 1.3) compared to normals (2.8 +/- 1.6; P < 0.05). This difference was also true when peak filling rate was computed in stroke counts per second (3.8 +/- 0.8 in obeses vs. 4.4 +/- 0.4 in normals; p < 0.05). Repeat analysis in a subgroup of 10 young obese subjects (age < or = 30 years) confirmed decreased ejection fraction at rest (60 +/- 4%; p < 0.05) and peak filling rate (2.4 +/- 0.4 end-diastolic counts/s; p < 0.05), as well as the lack of ejection fraction increase during exercise (59 +/- 9%).

Heightened adiposity and inadequate musculature secondary to obesity alter bipedal stance and gait, diminish musculoskeletal tissue quality, and compromise neuromuscular feedback; these physiological changes alter stability and increase injury risk from falls. Studies in the field focus on obese patients across a broad range of body mass indices (BMI >30 kg/m2) but without isolating the most morbidly obese subset (BMI >/=40 kg/m2). We investigated the impact of obesity in perturbing postural stability in morbidly obese subjects elected for bariatric intervention, harboring a higher-spectrum BMI. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Traditional force plate measurements and stabilograms are gold standards employed when measuring center of pressure (COP) and postural sway. To quantify the extent of postural instability in subjects with obesity before bariatric surgery, we assessed 17 obese subjects with an average BMI of 40 kg/m2 in contrast to 13 nonobese subjects with an average BMI of 30 kg/m2. COP and postural sway were measured from static and dynamic tasks. Involuntary movements were measured when patients performed static stances, with eyes either opened or closed. Two additional voluntary movements were measured when subjects performed dynamic, upper torso tasks with eyes opened. RESULTS: Mean body weight was 85% (p < 0.001) greater in obese than nonobese subjects. Following static balance assessments, we observed greater sway displacement in the anteroposterior (AP) direction in obese subjects with eyes open (87%, p < 0.002) and eyes closed (76%, p = 0.04) versus nonobese subjects. Obese subjects also exhibited a higher COP velocity in static tests when subjects' eyes were open (47%, p = 0.04). Dynamic tests demonstrated no differences between groups in sway displacement in either direction; however, COP velocity in the mediolateral (ML) direction was reduced (31%, p < 0.02) in obese subjects while voluntarily swaying in the AP direction, but increased in the same cohort when swaying in the ML direction (40%, p < 0.04). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Importantly, these data highlight obesity's contribution towards increased postural instability. Obese subjects exhibited greater COP displacement at higher AP velocities versus nonobese subjects, suggesting that clinically obese individuals show greater instability than nonobese subjects. Identifying factors contributory to instability could encourage patient-specific physical therapies and presurgical measures to mitigate instability and monitor postsurgical balance improvements.","['Pagnotti, Gabriel M', 'Haider, Amna', 'Yang, Ariel', 'Cottell, Kathryn E', 'Tuppo, Catherine M', 'Tong, Kai-Yu', 'Pryor, Aurora D', 'Rubin, Clinton T', 'Chan, M Ete']","['Pagnotti GM', 'Haider A', 'Yang A', 'Cottell KE', 'Tuppo CM', 'Tong KY', 'Pryor AD', 'Rubin CT', 'Chan ME']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'Bariatric and Metabolic Weight Loss Center, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'Bariatric and Metabolic Weight Loss Center, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Bariatric and Metabolic Weight Loss Center, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA, meilin.chan@stonybrook.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Obes Facts,Obesity facts,101469429,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Bariatrics', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity, Morbid/*physiopathology/surgery', 'Physical Therapy Modalities', '*Postural Balance', 'Preoperative Period', 'Young Adult']",PMC7670358,['NOTNLM'],"['Bariatric intervention', 'Fall risk', 'Musculoskeletal health', 'Obesity', 'Postural instability']","['C.T.

OBJECTIVE: To compare body composition, basal metabolic rate (BMR) and metabolic outcomes of adults, with lesional or genetic hypothalamic obesity, with obese patients suffering from primary obesity, once matched for body mass index (BMI). DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Adults with hypothalamic obesity of genetic origin (Prader Willi syndrome (PWS)) or acquired hypothalamic damage (HD), such as craniopharygioma, were compared with obese control candidates awaiting bariatric surgery (C), with a BMI between 35 and 65 kg m(-)(2), and aged between 18 and 50 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body composition measured by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning, BMR using indirect calorimetry, hormonal and metabolic assessments. RESULTS: A total of 27 adults with a genetic diagnosis of PWS, 15 obese subjects with HD and 206 obese controls with similar BMI were studied. Compared with the control group, PWS patients had an increased percentage of fat mass (FM), and a decreased percentage of android FM. The BMR of PWS patients was significantly lower than controls and highly correlated with lean body mass in PWS and C patients. Body composition of HD was similar with those of obese patients. A trend toward an increased prevalence of diabetes in HD patients and of cytolysis in PWS was observed in comparison with primary obese patients. CONCLUSION: Genetic and lesional hypothalamic obesities have different consequences for phenotypic features such as body composition or BMR compared with primary obese patients. The mechanisms of adipose tissue development and metabolic complications may be different between genetic and lesional obesities.","['Lloret-Linares, C', 'Faucher, P', 'Coupaye, M', 'Alili, R', 'Green, A', 'Basdevant, A', 'Clement, K', 'Poitou, C']","['Lloret-Linares C', 'Faucher P', 'Coupaye M', 'Alili R', 'Green A', 'Basdevant A', 'Clement K', 'Poitou C']","['1] Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Lariboisiere, Unit of Therapeutic Research, Department of Internal Medicine, Paris, France [2] INSERM U705, CNRS UMR 8206, Neuropsychopharmacology of Drug Addiction, Faculty of Pharmacy, University Paris Descartes, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Obes (Lond),International journal of obesity (2005),101256108,,IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Basal Metabolism', '*Body Composition', 'Body Fat Distribution', 'Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamic Diseases/complications/epidemiology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/epidemiology/etiology/*metabolism', 'Prader-Willi Syndrome/complications/epidemiology/*metabolism']",,,,,2013/01/16 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/01/16 06:00'],"['2012/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2012/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ijo2012228 [pii]', '10.1038/ijo.2012.228 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Obes (Lond). 2013 Sep;37(9):1198-203. doi: 10.1038/ijo.2012.228.

The possible link between alexithymia and psychosomatic or psychopathological disorders is now well documented. In particular, studies suggested that alexithymia may be frequently observed in obese or bulimic patients. This study was designed to investigate the link between obesity and alexithymia according to the presence or not of binge eating problems; 40 obese female patients (BMI > or = 27.3) seeking obesity treatment and 32 normal weight women used as controls were included in the study. In the obese group, 11 patients (27.5%) exhibited binge-eating disorder according to the DSM IV criteria. Alexithymia was assessed using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS), and past and current mental disorders were assessed by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM III-R (SCID). In addition, current depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The mean TAS score was found significantly higher in obese patients than in controls (72.6 +/- 11.8 vs 65.2 +/- 9.3, respectively; p < 0.005). In the same way, alexithymia (defined by TAS score > or = 74) was found significantly more frequent in obese patients than in controls (52.5% vs 21.8%, respectively; p < 0.03). However, among obese patients no significant difference was found between patients with and without binge-eating disorder. Current major depression was also found significantly more frequent in obese patients than in controls (15% vs 0%, respectively; p < 0.03), and the mean BDI score was very significantly higher in obese patients (12.2 +/- 8.7 vs 4.6 +/- 4.6, respectively; p < 0.0001). Comparisons between obese patients with and without binge-eating disorder showed that only past major depression was found significantly more frequent in those with binge-eating disorder (81.8% vs 10.3%, respectively; p < 0.0001), although the mean BDI score was significantly higher in patients with binge-eating disorder (18.5 +/- 11.7 vs 9.8 +/- 5.9, respectively; p < 0.02). Group by group comparisons suggested that two factors may play a role in the correlation found between obesity and alexithymia. First, the mean TAS score was found significantly higher in subjects with low educational level (p < 0.05), obese patients exhibiting significantly lower educational level when compared to controls (p < 0.002). Then, a significant positive correlation was found between TAS scores and BDI scores (Spearman's test: p < 0.01), obese patients showing significantly higher BDI scores than controls (p < 0.0001). In order to confirm these results, a logistic regression procedure was performed in the total sample (obese patients + controls). Three factors were found significantly increasing the risk to get a TAS score > or = 74: low educational level (odds ratio: 3.56), past and/or current major depression (odds ratio: 2.77), and BDI score > or = 8 (odds ratio: 2.18). Obesity in itself had no significant effect on TAS scores. Our results confirm that alexithymia is a psychological feature frequently observed in obese patients. In our study, the correlation found between obesity and alexithymia appears to be irrespective of binge-eating disorder, and seems to be mediated by the educational level and the frequency of associated depression. However, further investigations need to be done in order to specify the relationships between obesity, alexithymia, low educational level, and depression.","['De Chouly De Lenclave, M B', 'Florequin, C', 'Bailly, D']","['De Chouly De Lenclave MB', 'Florequin C', 'Bailly D']","[""Centre d'Information et de Traitement des Dependances, Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire, 57, boulevard de Metz, 59037 Lille.""]",['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Encephale,L'Encephale,7505643,,IM,"['Adult', 'Affective Symptoms/diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Body Mass Index', 'Comorbidity', 'Feeding and Eating Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imagination', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology', 'Obesity/diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,,,,2001/11/01 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/01 10:00'],"['2001/11/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/01 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Encephale. 2001 Jul-Aug;27(4):343-50.,,,,,,,,,"Obesite, alexithymie, troubles psychopathologiques et binge eating: etude comparative entre 40 obeses et 32 temoins.",,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of disease comorbidities requires treatment interventions and proper dosing guidelines. However, drug development programs often do not have adequate representation of individuals who are obese in clinical trials, leaving gaps in the understanding of treatment response leading to a lack of adequate individualization options. Based on a recent survey of approved drug product package inserts, very few approved products included specific dosing based on obesity, in both adults and pediatrics. Reasons for the limited information on patients who are obese may include the under-reporting of information regarding such patients and a lack of clinical trial diversity in enrolling patient groups in whom obesity or obesity-related comorbidities are more prevalent. An inadvertent impact of the practice of exclusion of subsets of patients with some comorbidities in clinical trials may play a role in the reduced enrollment of individuals who are obese. Recently, regulatory authorities have taken specific initiatives to promote clinical trial diversity, including engaging with stakeholders and publishing regulatory guidance. These guidance documents highlight the need to enroll diverse clinical trial populations and provide recommendations on concepts related to drug development for obese populations. Such efforts will help to address the gap in information regarding drug response and dosing in patients who are obese.","['Vaidyanathan, Jayabharathi', 'Fletcher, Elimika Pfuma', 'Ramamoorthy, Anuradha', 'Madabushi, Rajanikanth', 'Burckart, Gilbert J']","['Vaidyanathan J', 'Fletcher EP', 'Ramamoorthy A', 'Madabushi R', 'Burckart GJ']","['Office of Clinical Pharmacology, Office of Translational Sciences, Center of Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.', 'Office of Clinical Pharmacology, Office of Translational Sciences, Center of Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.', 'Office of Clinical Pharmacology, Office of Translational Sciences, Center of Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.', 'Office of Clinical Pharmacology, Office of Translational Sciences, Center of Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.', 'Office of Clinical Pharmacology, Office of Translational Sciences, Center of Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Child', '*Obesity/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology', '*Drug Development']",,['NOTNLM'],"['FDA guidance', 'clinical pharmacology', 'clinical trial diversity', 'dosing', 'obesity']",,2023/11/09 12:42,2023/11/10 06:45,['2023/11/09 07:43'],"['2023/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2023/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/11/10 06:45 [medline]', '2023/11/09 12:42 [pubmed]', '2023/11/09 07:43 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcph.2327 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2023 Nov;63 Suppl 2:S10-S17. doi: 10.1002/jcph.2327.,,,,"['Published 2023.

Because the dialysis population has a high prevalence of excess adiposity, in addition to a strikingly elevated mortality rate, the effects of obesity are of potential clinical importance. In contrast to the general population, the preponderance of data in dialysis, particularly hemodialysis patients, suggest that adiposity has a neutral or even protective association with mortality. Although methodological concerns exist with regards to confounding and survival bias, among others, the major limitation of this body of literature is its inability to establish causality. Thus, although obese dialysis patients, with certain exceptions, appear to live longer, there is no evidence to suggest that intentional weight loss adversely affects patient outcomes. In light of these limitations and the substantial body of literature implicating obesity as a pathophysiological state, it is currently premature to advocate for excess adiposity as being beneficial or intentional weight loss as dangerous. Decisions regarding optimal weight should be made by clinicians on an individual basis and with close supervision and follow-up. Efforts should be made to preserve lean mass during weight loss regimens by encouraging exercise and recommending sufficient protein consumption. Future research efforts in this area should focus on interventional trials designed to manipulate weight and measure outcomes, identifying potentially beneficial secretory products of adipose tissue, and documenting obesity's effects on quality of life and resource utilization in the dialysis setting.","['Friedman, Allon N']",['Friedman AN'],"['Division of Nephrology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA. allfried@ipui.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Dial,Seminars in dialysis,8911629,,IM,"['Body Mass Index', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications/*mortality/therapy', 'Obesity/complications/*mortality', 'Renal Dialysis/*mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",,,,,2006/03/23 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/03/23 09:00'],"['2006/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['SDI139 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1525-139X.2006.00139.x [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Dial. 2006 Mar-Apr;19(2):136-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1525-139X.2006.00139.x.,,,,,,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little, however, is known concerning obesity's impact on sensory systems. Because olfaction is linked with ingestive behavior to guide food choice, its potential dysfunction during obesity could evoke a positive feedback loop to perpetuate poor ingestive behaviors. To determine the effect of chronic energy imbalance and reveal any structural or functional changes associated with obesity, we induced long-term, diet-induced obesity by challenging mice to high-fat diets: (1) in an obesity-prone (C57BL/6J) and obesity-resistant (Kv1.3(-/-)) line of mice, and compared this with (2) late-onset, genetic-induced obesity in MC4R(-/-) mice in which diabetes secondarily precipitates after disruption of the hypothalamic axis. We report marked loss of olfactory sensory neurons and their axonal projections after exposure to a fatty diet, with a concomitant reduction in electro-olfactogram amplitude. Loss of olfactory neurons and associated circuitry is linked to changes in neuronal proliferation and normal apoptotic cycles. Using a computer-controlled, liquid-based olfactometer, mice maintained on fatty diets learn reward-reinforced behaviors more slowly, have deficits in reversal learning demonstrating behavioral inflexibility, and exhibit reduced olfactory discrimination. When obese mice are removed from their high-fat diet to regain normal body weight and fasting glucose, olfactory dysfunctions are retained. We conclude that chronic energy imbalance therefore presents long-lasting structural and functional changes in the operation of the sensory system designed to encode external and internal chemical information and leads to altered olfactory- and reward-driven behaviors.","['Thiebaud, Nicolas', 'Johnson, Melissa C', 'Butler, Jessica L', 'Bell, Genevieve A', 'Ferguson, Kassandra L', 'Fadool, Andrew R', 'Fadool, James C', 'Gale, Alana M', 'Gale, David S', 'Fadool, Debra A']","['Thiebaud N', 'Johnson MC', 'Butler JL', 'Bell GA', 'Ferguson KL', 'Fadool AR', 'Fadool JC', 'Gale AM', 'Gale DS', 'Fadool DA']","['Department of Biological Science and Program in Neuroscience, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida 32306.', 'Department of Biology, University of West Georgia, Carrollton, Georgia 30118.', 'Department of Biological Science and Program in Neuroscience, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida 32306.', 'Department of Biological Science and Program in Neuroscience, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida 32306.', 'Department of Biological Science and Program in Neuroscience, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida 32306.', 'Department of Biological Science and Program in Neuroscience, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida 32306.', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida 32310.', 'Larry A.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study including 60 obese patients and 60 controls. BED was diagnosed using the Binge Eating Scale. Quality of life was assessed by the Quality Of Life, Obesity and Dietetics Scale, and depression and anxiety symptoms by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: The obese group had a higher prevalence of BED than the control group (40% versus 8.3%; p < 0.001; OR = 3.5). The average score of BES was also higher (p < 0.001). Obese patients with BED were younger (p = 0.034). BED was correlated with an early onset of obesity (p = 0.01; OR = 1.12), depression (p = 0.002), anxiety (p = 0.008) and a poorer quality of life.

Masked hypertension is a relatively recent reported entity with a diagnostic problem. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and paraclinical characteristics and to identify the predictive factors of masked hypertension in obese patients. METHODS: It is a prospective study including obese patients with normal arterial pressure at office. All of these patients were given ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) to screen for masked hypertension, laboratory tests and a complete echocardiography study. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients were included. The mean age was 46.52+/-10.4 years. The mean systolic blood pressure (BP) at office was 120.8+/-8.8mmHg and the mean diastolic BP was 75+/-7.3mmHg. The prevalence of masked hypertension in obese adults was 36% with a predominantly non-dipper profile (38%). The study of echocardiographic parameters found dilated left atrium (LA) in 16 patients (32%). The left ventricle (LV) was hypertrophied in 32 patients (64%). The overall LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) was on average -18.85+/-0.9% and the LA GLS was on average 37.35+/-4.5%. In our study, metabolic syndrome, low HDL cholesterol, elevated fasting blood glucose, hyperuricemia, LA dilatation, LV hypertrophy, diastolic LV dysfunction and altered myocardial deformities were factors associated with masked hypertension in obese adults. CONCLUSION: It is important to screen for hypertension by ambulatory measurement in at-risk obese patients who present associated cardiovascular risk factors to reduce morbidity and mortality. Echocardiography and speckle tracking analysis could be helpful in detection sub-clinical myocardial deterioration in obese patients with masked hypertension.","['Charfeddine, S', 'Hadj Kacem, F', 'Bahloul, A', 'Triki, F', 'Hammami, R', 'Rebai, M', 'Abid, M', 'Abid, L', 'Kammoun, S']","['Charfeddine S', 'Hadj Kacem F', 'Bahloul A', 'Triki F', 'Hammami R', 'Rebai M', 'Abid M', 'Abid L', 'Kammoun S']","[""Service de cardiologie, faculte de medecine de Sfax, universite de Sfax, hopital Hedi Chaker, Sfax, Tunisie; Unite de recherche de l'insuffisance cardiaque UR17ES37, faculte de medecine de Sfax, Universite de Sfax, Tunisie.

Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are obese but partly protected against insulin resistance. We hypothesised that the gut microbiota of PWS patients differs from that of non-genetically obese controls and correlate to metabolic health. Therefore, here we used PWS as a model to study the role of gut microbiota in the prevention of metabolic complications linked to obesity. DESIGN: We conducted a case-control study with 17 adult PWS patients and 17 obese subjects matched for body fat mass index, gender and age. The subjects were metabolically characterised and faecal microbiota was profiled by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The patients' parents were used as a non-obese control group. Stool samples from two PWS patients and two obese controls were used for faecal microbiota transplantations in germ-free mice to examine the impact of the microbiota on glucose metabolism. RESULTS: The composition of the faecal microbiota in patients with PWS differed from that of obese controls, and was characterised by higher phylogenetic diversity and increased abundance of several taxa such as Akkermansia, Desulfovibrio and Archaea, and decreased abundance of Dorea. Microbial taxa prevalent in the PWS microbiota were associated with markers of insulin sensitivity. Improved insulin resistance of PWS was partly transmitted by faecal microbiota transplantations into germ-free mice. CONCLUSION: The gut microbiota of PWS patients is similar to that of their non-obese parents and might play a role for the protection of PWS patients from metabolic complications.","['Olsson, Lisa M', 'Poitou, Christine', 'Tremaroli, Valentina', 'Coupaye, Muriel', 'Aron-Wisnewsky, Judith', 'Backhed, Fredrik', 'Clement, Karine', 'Caesar, Robert']","['Olsson LM', 'Poitou C', 'Tremaroli V', 'Coupaye M', 'Aron-Wisnewsky J', 'Backhed F', 'Clement K', 'Caesar R']","['The Wallenberg Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'INSERM, Nutrition and obesities; systemic approaches (NutriOmics) research Unit, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, Ile-de-France, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Reference Center for Rare Diseases (Prader-Willi Syndrome), Nutrition Department, University Hospital Pitie Salpetriere, Paris, Ile-de-France, France.', 'The Wallenberg Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Reference Center for Rare Diseases (Prader-Willi Syndrome), Nutrition Department, University Hospital Pitie Salpetriere, Paris, Ile-de-France, France.', 'INSERM, Nutrition and obesities; systemic approaches (NutriOmics) research Unit, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, Ile-de-France, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Reference Center for Rare Diseases (Prader-Willi Syndrome), Nutrition Department, University Hospital Pitie Salpetriere, Paris, Ile-de-France, France.', 'The Wallenberg Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Section for Metabolic Receptology and Enteroendocrinology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'INSERM, Nutrition and obesities; systemic approaches (NutriOmics) research Unit, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, Ile-de-France, France Robert.Caesar@wlab.gu.se karine.clement@inserm.fr.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Reference Center for Rare Diseases (Prader-Willi Syndrome), Nutrition Department, University Hospital Pitie Salpetriere, Paris, Ile-de-France, France.', 'The Wallenberg Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden Robert.Caesar@wlab.gu.se karine.clement@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gut,Gut,2985108R,"['0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Fecal Microbiota Transplantation', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', '*Gastrointestinal Microbiome/genetics/physiology', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Obesity/complications/metabolism/*microbiology', 'Prader-Willi Syndrome/complications/metabolism/*microbiology', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics']",PMC7306984,['NOTNLM'],"['diabetes mellitus', 'glucose metabolism', 'intestinal bacteria']","['Competing interests: FB is in the Scientific Advisory Board of MetaboGen, Sweden.']",2019/10/16 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2019/10/16 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/10/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['gutjnl-2019-319322 [pii]', '10.1136/gutjnl-2019-319322 [doi]']",ppublish,Gut. 2020 Jul;69(7):1229-1238. doi: 10.1136/gutjnl-2019-319322.

To the physician who treats the obese adolescent, it would be wise to review the pitfalls of previous programs. The multidisciplinary approach is an attempt to combine dietary restriction and increased physical activity to gradually mobilize fat stores and provide psychologic support. Motivation is reinforced by a committed staff and by the patients' own obese peers with whom they meet weekly.

The excess of adipose tissue contributes to the production of free radicals that sustain both a local and a systemic chronic inflammatory state, whereas its reduction can bring to an improvement in inflammation and oxidative stress. In our work, using the fluorescent lipid probe BODIPY(R) 581/591 C(11) and the gammaH2AX foci assay, a well-known marker of DNA double strand breaks (DSB), we evaluated the extent of cell membrane oxidation and DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes of normal weight (NW) controls and obese patients sampled before and after bariatric surgery. Compared to NW controls, we observed a marked increase in both the frequencies of oxidized cells or nuclei exhibiting phosphorylation of histone H2AX in preoperatory obese patients. After bariatric surgery, obese patients, resampled over one-year follow-up, improved oxidative damage and reduced the presence of DSB. In conclusion, the present study highlights the importance for obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery to also monitor these molecular markers during their postoperative follow-up.","['Chiaramonte, Anna', 'Testi, Serena', 'Pelosini, Caterina', 'Micheli, Consuelo', 'Falaschi, Aurora', 'Ceccarini, Giovanni', 'Santini, Ferruccio', 'Scarpato, Roberto']","['Chiaramonte A', 'Testi S', 'Pelosini C', 'Micheli C', 'Falaschi A', 'Ceccarini G', 'Santini F', 'Scarpato R']","['Unita di Genetica, Dipartimento di Biologia, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Unita di Genetica, Dipartimento di Biologia, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Obesity and Lipodystrophy Center, Endocrinology Unit, University Hospital, Pisa, Italy.', 'Unita di Genetica, Dipartimento di Biologia, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Unita di Genetica, Dipartimento di Biologia, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Obesity and Lipodystrophy Center, Endocrinology Unit, University Hospital, Pisa, Italy.', 'Obesity and Lipodystrophy Center, Endocrinology Unit, University Hospital, Pisa, Italy.', 'Unita di Genetica, Dipartimento di Biologia, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.

At least theoretically, then, obesity's special quality is that it does not present any therapeutic problem. Restriction in food intake is currently the treatment of choice; to be effective, food intake must be cut so that the energy provided is below the obese person's daily consumption, on average below 1200 calories per day, while at the same time holding a comparatively high intake of indispensable elements (proteins, vitamins, certain minerals and oligo-elements). The physician has a choice of various possibilities represented by fasting, a variety of free or controlled diets, protein diets or diets with low carbohydrate content and with a variable fat content; dissociated, zig-zag, one food diets etc. Substantially all these tend to limit the total quantity of glycides and boost the feeling of satiety by increasing the total volume of good while keeping total calories unvaried. It is clear that each of them has specific indications and clear-cut contraindications. The aim is to produce a calory shortfall, not cause denutrition.

In this context, a causal role for unbalanced T regulatory cell (Treg)-dependent mechanisms has been largely suggested. Obesity is the most common nutritional disorder in dogs. However, it is not defined whether canine obesity may influence circulating Treg as well as if their number variation might be associated with the occurrence of systemic inflammation. The present study investigated the immune profile of healthy adult obese dogs belonging to the Labrador Retriever breed, in comparison with the normal weight counterpart. Indeed, obesity has been described as particularly evident in this dogs. With this purpose, 26 healthy dogs were enrolled and divided into two groups based on body condition score (BCS): controls (CTR: BCS 4-5) and obeses (OB: BCS >/= 7). Our data indicate that adult obese Labrador Retrievers are characterised by the inverse correlation between leptin serum concentration and circulating Treg (CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+)) levels. In addition, an increased number of cytotoxic T cell effectors (CD3(+)CD8(+)) and a higher IFN-gamma production by cytotoxic T lymphocytes were observed in OB group. These results may provide new insights into the immunological dysregulation frequently associated to obesity in humans and still undefined in dogs.","['Palatucci, Anna Teresa', 'Piantedosi, Diego', 'Rubino, Valentina', 'Giovazzino, Angela', 'Guccione, Jacopo', 'Pernice, Vlenia', 'Ruggiero, Giuseppina', 'Cortese, Laura', 'Terrazzano, Giuseppe']","['Palatucci AT', 'Piantedosi D', 'Rubino V', 'Giovazzino A', 'Guccione J', 'Pernice V', 'Ruggiero G', 'Cortese L', 'Terrazzano G']","['Istituto di Endocrinologia e Oncologia Sperimentale (IEOS), Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Via Pansini 5, 80131, Napoli, Italy,; Dipartimento di Scienze, Universita della Basilicata, Via Nazario Sauro 85, 85100, Potenza, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria e Produzioni Animali, Universita Federico II, Via Federico Delpino 1, 80137, Napoli, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze, Universita della Basilicata, Via Nazario Sauro 85, 85100, Potenza, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche Traslazionali, Universita Federico II, Via Pansini 5, 80131, Napoli, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria e Produzioni Animali, Universita Federico II, Via Federico Delpino 1, 80137, Napoli, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche Traslazionali, Universita Federico II, Via Pansini 5, 80131, Napoli, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche Traslazionali, Universita Federico II, Via Pansini 5, 80131, Napoli, Italy.

The brain under obesity's conditions is more sensitive to ischemic injury. However, the impact of a brief episode of TI under obesity's conditions has not been fully addressed yet. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of a brief TI in the hippocampus of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese gerbils and related mechanisms. Gerbils were maintained on HFD or normal diet (ND) for 12 weeks and subjected to 2 min TI. HFD gerbils were heavier, with higher blood glucose, serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and leptin levels. Massive loss of pyramidal neurons occurred in the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) field of HFD animals at 5 days after 2 min of TI, but 2 min of TI did not elicit death of pyramidal neurons in ND gerbils. The HFD group showed significantly increased levels of oxidative stress indicators (dihydroethidium and 4-hydroxynonenal) and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta) and microglial activation in pre- and/or post-ischemic phases compared to the ND group. Levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and phosphorylated-mTOR in the CA1 field of the HFD group were also significantly higher than the ND group. On the other hand, inhibition of mTOR activation by rapamycin (an allosteric mTOR inhibitor) significantly attenuated neuronal death induced by HFD, showing reduction of HFD-induced increases of oxidative stress indicators and proinflammatory cytokines, and microglia activation.

Donkeys have greater digestive efficiency and tend to expend less energy than horses or ponies, which contributes to obesity in nonworking donkeys. Obesity in all equine species increases risk of chronic health conditions such as laminitis and insulin resistance. Previous studies in horses and ponies have documented obesity's potential effects on glucose-insulin dynamics with lower insulin sensitivity and higher insulin responses to glucose. However, limited studies on obesity and its health impacts in donkeys exist, so these effects on glucose-insulin dynamics have not been fully studied. Twenty-four donkeys were selected according to initial body condition score (BCS) and divided into three categories with eight donkeys in each: thin, moderate, and obese. A frequently sampled glucose-insulin tolerance test was performed with subsequent MINMOD analysis to determine the effects of BCS on glucose-insulin dynamics. Basal insulin was highest in obese donkeys when compared with moderate and thin donkeys (P = .02 and P = .01, respectively). There was an overall trend across groups for BCS to lower insulin sensitivity (P = .06). No other effect was found. Body condition score seems to affect donkeys in a similar manner to horses and ponies as higher BCS was associated with higher basal insulin and may lower insulin sensitivity. Higher basal insulin concentrations in obese donkeys could negatively influence health and contribute to serious, chronic conditions.","['Pritchard, Abby', 'Nielsen, Brian', 'McLean, Amy', 'Robison, Cara', 'Yokoyama, Melvin', 'Hengemuehle, Susan', 'Bailey, Simon', 'Harris, Patricia']","['Pritchard A', 'Nielsen B', 'McLean A', 'Robison C', 'Yokoyama M', 'Hengemuehle S', 'Bailey S', 'Harris P']","['Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.

Recent studies have identified that plasma imidazole propionate (ImP), a microbial-produced metabolite, is increased in patients with prediabetes and T2D. More recently, ImP was found to be significantly increased in patients with overt CVD. Here, we aimed to investigate the association between ImP and CVD risk factors: blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and insulin-resistance in overweight and obese subjects without T2D or use of any metabolic diseases-related medication. METHODS: Plasma metabolites, including ImP, were determined in 107 male or post-menopausal women with overweight/obesity, but without T2D. Insulin-sensitivity was assessed with the gold standard method: the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp using the isotope [6,6-(2)H(2)] glucose and expressed as glucose rate of disposal (Rd) for peripheral insulin sensitivity and suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP) for hepatic insulin sensitivity. RESULTS: Partial correlation analysis controlled for BMI and age showed a significant correlation between ImP and diastolic blood pressure (r(s) = 0.285, p = 0.004) and a borderline significance with systolic blood pressure (r(s) = 0.187, p = 0.060); however, systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not correlate with ImP precursor histidine (r(s) = 0.063, p = 0.526 and r = -0.038, p = 0.712, respectively). We did not find a correlation between ImP with LDL-cholesterol or HDL-cholesterol (r(s) = -0.181, p = 0.064 and r(s) = 0.060, p = 0.546, respectively). Furthermore, there was no association between plasma ImP concentrations and Rd and EGP suppression. CONCLUSION: In this cohort with overweight/obese subjects without T2D, plasma ImP concentrations were positively correlated with diastolic blood pressure but not with insulin-sensitivity.","['van Son, Jamie', 'Serlie, Mireille J', 'Stahlman, Marcus', 'Backhed, Fredrik', 'Nieuwdorp, Max', 'Aron-Wisnewsky, Judith']","['van Son J', 'Serlie MJ', 'Stahlman M', 'Backhed F', 'Nieuwdorp M', 'Aron-Wisnewsky J']","['Department of Vascular Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location AMC, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location AMC, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location AMC, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Wallenberg Laboratory, University of Gothenburg, Bruna Straket 16, SE-413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Wallenberg Laboratory, University of Gothenburg, Bruna Straket 16, SE-413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Physiology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Region Vastra Gotaland, Bla Straket 5, SE-413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Vascular Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location AMC, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location AMC, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Vascular Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Location AMC, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Nutrition and Obesities, Systemic Approaches (NutriOmics) Research Group, Sorbonne Universite, Inserm, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Assistante Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Nutrition Department, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, CRNH Ile de France, 75013 Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Nutrients,Nutrients,101521595,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Lipids)', '1074-59-5 (5-imidazolepropionic acid)']",IM,"['Bacteria/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/blood', '*Blood Pressure', 'Female', '*Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*blood', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Lipids/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*blood/microbiology/physiopathology']",PMC8399073,['NOTNLM'],"['cardiovascular disease', 'gut microbiota', 'hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp', 'imidazole propionate', 'insulin resistance', 'obesity']","['The authors declare that there are no conflict of interest associated with this', 'manuscript.']",2021/08/28 06:00,2021/09/23 06:00,['2021/08/27 01:21'],"['2021/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/27 01:21 [entrez]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['nu13082706 [pii]', 'nutrients-13-02706 [pii]', '10.3390/nu13082706 [doi]']",epublish,Nutrients. 2021 Aug 6;13(8):2706. doi: 10.3390/nu13082706.,"['17CVD01/Fondation Leducq/', 'NNF15OC0016798/Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research/', 'Fondation Bettencourt Schueller/', '09150182010020/ZONMW_/ZonMw/Netherlands', 'CAMIT grant 2018/Novo Nordisk/', '2017-01996_3/Joint Programming Initiative A healthy diet for a healthy life/', 'AFA insurances/']",20210806,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9876-2876', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4202-0339', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4871-8818', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3104-9769']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heterozygous variants of MRAP2, encoding a G coupled-protein receptor accessory protein implicated in energy control notably via the melanocortin-4 receptor, have been recently identified. A 24-year-old patient with early-onset severe obesity (body mass index [BMI]: 64 kg/m2) associated with hypertension, respiratory complications, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes was referred to our department. Sleeve gastrectomy was successful. A new heterozygous variant in MRAP2 (NM_138409.4: c.154G>C/p.G52R) variant was identified in the patient DNA. Functional assessment confirmed that this new variant was pathogenic. We report a new pathogenic loss-of-function mutation in MRAP2 in a patient suffering from a severe multicomplicated obesity.

This hypersecretion of insulin, together with other ill-defined factors, is subsequently responsible for a state of insulin resistance. The early oversecretion of insulin in hypothalamic and genetic (e.g. fa/fa rats) obesities can be experimentally demonstrated. Thus, within 20 min of acute lesion of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), glucose-induced insulin secretion is greater in lesioned than in non-lesioned control rats; this increase can be blocked by superimposed, acute vagotomy. Moreover, an infusion of glucose to 17-day-old, pre-weaned control and genetically pre-obese rats (i.e. animals genetically-determined to become obese but with a normal body weight at this age) elicits much greater insulinaemia in the pre-obese than in the controls, despite similar basal, pre-infusion values in both. This increased insulin secretion in the pre-obese rats can be restored to normal by pre-treating them acutely with the cholinergic inhibitor, atropine. Thus, in these two types of obesity, an increased vagal tone appears to be of importance for the early occurrence of insulin over-secretion. Hyperinsulinaemia produced by increased tone of the vagus nerve appears to be reinforced by the decreased activity of the sympathetic system observed in obese rodents. In many obese rodents, plasma growth hormone levels are abnormally low. The inadequate secretion of this hyperglycaemic hormone may explain why, in some types of obesity syndrome, hyperglycaemia is not necessarily present, despite insulin resistance. Insulin resistance in experimental obesities has been shown to occur at the level of the adipose tissue, the muscles and more recently, the liver. The latter has been demonstrated using the in vivo euglycaemic clamp technique; thus, glycogenolysis of genetically obese (fa/fa) rats could not be shut off, as in controls, by either basal or increased plasma insulin levels. This particular pathway is therefore insulin resistant. The precise etiology of the early over-secretion of insulin in VMH-lesioned rats is, however, unknown: with VMH lesions, the origin is clearly the central nervous system (CNS), but the pathways actually interrupted by the lesions and those responsible for the hyperactivity of the vagus, remain to be determined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Jeanrenaud, B']",['Jeanrenaud B'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Experientia Suppl,Experientia.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe obesity's effect on complications and outcomes in degenerative spondylolisthesis patients treated by minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MI TLIF). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Obesity is associated with a greater complication rate among lumbar spine surgery patients. Poor clinical outcomes might likewise be supposed, but the association is not well established. Minimally invasive techniques have been developed to reduce complications and improve clinical outcomes in comparison to traditional open techniques. METHODS: We reviewed 134 consecutive patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis undergoing MI TLIF. Subjects were grouped into nonobese (N = 65) and obese (N = 69) cohorts. The obese group was further subdivided by BMI. Patient demographics, perioperative complications, and outcome scores were collected over a minimum of 24 months. Four periods (intraoperative, postoperative hospitalization, 6-month, and 24-month postoperative) were assessed. RESULTS: Cohort demographics were not significantly different, but it was noted that obese patients had more major comorbidities than nonobese patients. There was no difference in intraoperative complications between the two groups. The in-hospital complication rate was significantly greater in the obese group. The 6-month postoperative complication rate was not different between cohorts. Wound drainage was most common and noted only in the obese cohort. Complications at 24 months were not different but did trend toward significance in the obese for recurrence of symptoms and total complications. Functional outcome was better among nonobese subjects compared with obese subjects at every interval (significant at 6 and 12 months). Back pain scores were significantly better among nonobese subjects than obese subjects at 24 months, but Leg Pain scores were not different. CONCLUSIONS: MI TLIF can be safely performed in the obese population despite a higher in-hospital complication rate. Knowledge of common complications will help the treatment team appropriately manage obese patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis.

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of abdominal adiposities using predictive equations for Asian Indian adults and to determine the prevalence of metabolically healthy subjects among those overweight/obese and with normal BMI. METHODS: A community-based survey was conducted among those aged 18-69 years in the district of Puducherry between February 2019 and February 2020. We surveyed 2,560 individuals selected through multi-stage cluster random sampling from urban and rural areas (50 wards and 50 villages, respectively) of the district. Anthropometric measurements, such as height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure were recorded from each participant. Fasting blood sample was collected from each alternate participant to estimate metabolic risk factors. RESULTS: Over four-fifths (85.6%; 95% CI: 84.2-86.9) and two-thirds (69.7%; 95% CI: 67.9-71.6) of the population in the district had high levels of intra-abdominal adipose tissue (IAAT) and total abdominal fat (TAF), respectively. Both the risk factors were significantly higher among women and urban population. About 43% (95% CI: 41-44.9) of the population had high abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) with a significantly higher prevalence among the urban population. Among those overweight/obese (n = 773), almost all 99.4% (95% CI: 98.7-99.9) were metabolically unhealthy. Among subjects with normal BMI (n = 314), only about 2.9% (95% CI: 1.3-4.8) were metabolically healthy. CONCLUSION: We highlight the substantially high prevalence of IAAT, TAF, and SCAT in the district of Puducherry. Almost all the study population was metabolically unhealthy irrespective of their BMI levels.","['Sivanantham, Parthibane', 'Sahoo, Jaya Prakash', 'Lakshminarayanan, Subitha', 'Bobby, Zachariah', 'Kar, Sitanshu Sekhar']","['Sivanantham P', 'Sahoo JP', 'Lakshminarayanan S', 'Bobby Z', 'Kar SS']","['Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, India.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, India.', 'Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, India.', 'Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Fam Pract,Family practice,8500875,,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Female', '*Obesity, Abdominal/epidemiology', '*Overweight/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Prevalence', 'Obesity/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Body Mass Index']",,['NOTNLM'],"['body mass index', 'fat distribution', 'metabolic syndrome', 'obesity', 'phenotype', 'waist circumference']",,2022/08/02 06:00,2023/03/30 06:11,['2022/08/01 02:02'],"['2023/03/30 06:11 [medline]', '2022/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/08/01 02:02 [entrez]']","['6652637 [pii]', '10.1093/fampra/cmac082 [doi]']",ppublish,Fam Pract. 2023 Mar 28;40(2):282-289. doi: 10.1093/fampra/cmac082.,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2022.

A major benefit of physical activity is the association with better long-term maintenance of weight loss. Physical activity has also positive psychological effects and increases quality of life. An evaluation of the usual level of physical activity and inactivity is needed for each patient. Physical activity counselling should be individualized and graded, in a perspective of individual progression. In subjects with massive obesity, remobilization based on physiotherapy techniques is the first step. All patients should be given simple advice to decrease sedentary behavior: use the stairs instead of the escalators, limit the time spent seated, etc. In general, current physical activity recommendations for the general population fit well with a majority of obese patients, i.e. a minimum of 30 minutes/day of moderate intensity physical activity (brisk walking or equivalent) on most, and preferably all, days of the week. Physical activities of higher intensities (endurance training programme) can be proposed on an individual basis. The type of physical activity required for long-term weight maintenance, and the question of adherence to physical activity recommendations in obese patients should be further investigated.","['Oppert, J M', 'Balarac, N']","['Oppert JM', 'Balarac N']","['Service de Medecine et Nutrition, Hotel-Dieu, 75004 Paris. jean-michel.oppert@htd.ap-hop-paris.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Ann Endocrinol (Paris),Annales d'endocrinologie,0116744,,IM,"['*Exercise', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*therapy', 'Patient Compliance', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Weight Loss']",,,,,2002/01/15 10:00,2002/02/01 10:01,['2002/01/15 10:00'],"['2002/01/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/15 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Endocrinol (Paris). 2001 Sep;62(4 Pt 2):S37-42.,,,,,,,26,,Activite physique et prise en charge des patients obeses.,,,,,,,,,,,

Both lesions groups were hyperphagic and showed similar weight gains. Although both lesion groups became obese (measured by % carcass fat), VMH rats were fatter than PVH animals. Similarly, only VMH rats were hyperinsulinemic. Further tests were conducted in PVH and VMH rats restricted to control body weights. VMH, but not PVH, rats developed a persisting elevation in basal gastric acid secretion. As well, only VMH, and not PVH, animals developed an obesity when restricted to normal weights.

Our series of studies have suggested a potential reversibility in ANS activity regulating fat metabolism and appetite control by regular exercise training in middle aged individuals and obese children with depressed ANS activity. In other words habitual exercise plays a vital role in enhancing not only fat and glucose metabolism, but also ANS activities in the prevention of obesity and appetite control. There are growing expectations that too much sitting is a real and substantial risk to health. One of the intriguing findings from these accelerometer measurement studies is that breaks in sedentary time were shown to have beneficial associations with metabolic biomarkers, due possibly to challenging and enhancing autonomic nervous system that regulates body weight and appetite. Recent findings of brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) seem to have shed some light upon age-related neurodegenerative diseases and appear to influence energy metabolism, appetite and aspects of neuro-cognitive function. These data strongly suggest that a lack of exercise as characterized by a sedentary lifestyle and an unhealthy diet may lead to accelerated ageing, diseases of the body and brain, and an overall decline in the quality of life.","['Moritani, Toshio', 'Akamatsu, Yasunori']","['Moritani T', 'Akamatsu Y']","['Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies, Kyoto University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo),Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,0402640,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '7171WSG8A2 (BDNF protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Appetite Regulation', '*Autonomic Nervous System', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', 'Child', '*Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders/etiology/metabolism/*prevention & control', '*Dietary Supplements', 'Exercise/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Life Style', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/etiology/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Obesity/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Sedentary Behavior']",,,,,2015/11/26 06:00,2016/09/02 06:00,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3177/jnsv.61.S122 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo). 2015;61 Suppl:S122-4. doi: 10.3177/jnsv.61.S122.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a subsample of the KORA-Survey S4 1999/2001 in the Augsburg region, Germany (n = 947, age: 25-74 years), number of visits to general practitioners (GP) and inpatient hospital days were self-reported in three computer-aided telephone interviews (CATI) over half a year. Body mass index, based on measured body height and weight, was used to define obesity according to WHO classification. Participants, stratified in normal weight (18.5 < or = BMI < 25), preobese (25 < r = BMI < 30), obese class 1 (30 < or = BMI < 35) and obese classes 2-3 (BMI > or = 35), were compared via logistic, zero-truncated negative binomial, and multinomial models to elucidate obesity's associations with utilization at all, its frequency, and high utilization. Sex, age, social class, health insurance, and place of residence were adjusted for in all models. Respondents in obesity class 1 were more prone to report at least one visit to a GP than those normal weight (OR = 1.84, p < 0.01), while obesity classes 2-3 were associated with frequent (IRR = 1.63, p < 0.05) and high utilization (OR = 3.57, p < 0.05). Regarding days in hospital, only the extremely obese (i. e. classes 2-3) reported significantly more utilization than those normal weight (days if hospitalized at all: IRR = 3.24, p < 0.05; high utilization: OR = 5.4, p < 0.01). Sex did not play a significant role in any model. Older respondents reported more utilization in terms of GP-visits, while only tending to do so regarding inpatient utilization. Both those with statutory (vs. private) health insurance and rural (vs. urban) place of residence had higher odds to visit a GP at all. Results point to an excess utilization of out- and inpatient health services by especially extremely obese adults, and underline the need to contrast obesity classes 2-3 vs. 1 in health services utilization research.","['von Lengerke, T', 'Happich, M', 'Reitmeir, P', 'John, J']","['von Lengerke T', 'Happich M', 'Reitmeir P', 'John J']","['GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, Institute of Health Economics and Health Care Management, Neuherberg, Germany. lengerke.thomas@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Gesundheitswesen,Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),9204210,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Ambulatory Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Delivery of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Inpatients/statistics & numerical data', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Outpatients/statistics & numerical data', 'Population Surveillance/methods', '*Registries', 'Research Design', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",,,,,2005/07/21 09:00,2005/10/06 09:00,['2005/07/21 09:00'],"['2005/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2005-858510 [doi]'],ppublish,Gesundheitswesen. 2005 Aug;67 Suppl 1:S150-7. doi: 10.1055/s-2005-858510.,,,,,,,,,,['Kora Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to compare metabolic, fat distribution, and transcriptomic signatures of sc adipose tissue (scAT) in PWS adults, with matched obese adults with primary obesities. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hormonal and metabolic assessments, systemic inflammation, and gene expression in scAT were compared between PWS patients and obese controls (OCs). Each 42nd PWS patient was matched with one randomly paired control with primary obesity. Matching factors were age, gender, fat mass (percentage), and diabetic status. RESULTS: Compared with OCs, the PWS group had a decreased percentage of trunk FM and a better metabolic profile with decreased insulin and homeostasis model assessment, an index of insulin-resistance, and increased concentrations of serum adiponectin and ghrelin. Adipocyte size relative to body fat was significantly higher in PWS vs OCs. scAT in PWS patients was characterized by a transcriptomic functional signature with enrichment of themes related to immunoinflammation, the extracellular matrix, and angiogenesis. A RT-PCR targeted study revealed that candidate genes encoding proinflammatory markers and remodeling molecules, CD68, CD3e, IL-1beta, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5, collagen type 4-alpha, and lysyl oxidase, were down-regulated. CONCLUSION: Matched for FM, PWS subjects have a better metabolic profile, a phenotype that could be linked to changes in scAT remodeling and promotion of adipocyte growth.","['Lacroix, Delphine', 'Moutel, Sandrine', 'Coupaye, Muriel', 'Huvenne, Helene', 'Faucher, Pauline', 'Pelloux, Veronique', 'Rouault, Christine', 'Bastard, Jean-Philippe', 'Cagnard, Nicolas', 'Dubern, Beatrice', 'Clement, Karine', 'Poitou, Christine']","['Lacroix D', 'Moutel S', 'Coupaye M', 'Huvenne H', 'Faucher P', 'Pelloux V', 'Rouault C', 'Bastard JP', 'Cagnard N', 'Dubern B', 'Clement K', 'Poitou C']","['INSERM, U1166, Nutriomic team 6 (D.L., H.H., V.P., C.R., B.D., K.C., C.P.), Sorbonne Universities (D.L., H.H., V.P., C.R., B.D., K.C., C.P.), University Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6, Unite Mixte de Recherche en Sante Unite 1166, and Institute of Cardiometabolism and Nutrition (ICAN) (S.M., M.C., P.F., K.C., C.P.), Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Department of Nutrition, and French Reference Centre for Prader-Willi Syndrome, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, F-75013 France; Functional Unit of Inflammatory and Metabolic Biomarkers (J.-P.B.), Department of Biochemistry and Hormonology, Tenon Hospital, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris, F-75970 Paris, France; Bioinformatics Platform (N.C.), Plateforme de Bioinformatique, SFR Necker, University Paris V, F-75015 Paris, France; and Department of Pediatric Nutrition and Gastroenterology (B.D.), Trousseau Hospital, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, F-37044 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,,IM,"['Adiposity/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Fat Distribution', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Obesity/complications/genetics/metabolism', 'Prader-Willi Syndrome/complications/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Subcutaneous Fat/*metabolism', '*Transcriptome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2014/12/06 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2014/12/06 06:00'],"['2014/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1210/jc.2014-3127 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2015 Mar;100(3):850-9. doi: 10.1210/jc.2014-3127.

Most ODs are associated with concomitant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but obesity by itself can cause OD, through mechanisms that remain poorly documented. The literature on obese non-PCOS women with OD is sparse. The aim of the present study was to analyze a population of obese non-PCOS women with OD to shed further light on the mechanism of ovulation disorder. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study of infertile obese women without PCOS compared a control group without OD (n=45) to a study group with OD (n=30) (OD group). Clinical, hormonal, and ultrasound characteristics were collected between cycle days 2 and 5. Women older than 37 years and women with PCOM (polycystic ovarian morphology) or hormonal disorder were excluded. RESULTS: Body mass index (BMI) was significantly higher in the OD group, as were waist circumference and insulin and leptin serum levels. Conversely, serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were significantly lower. After adjustment for BMI, only serum FSH level remained significantly different between the 2 groups. Discriminant analysis suggested that FSH may have a much stronger effect on OD than BMI. CONCLUSION: Low serum FSH level may contribute to OD in some obese women, independently of BMI. The pathophysiological mechanism of this finding and its impact on therapeutic strategies must be clarified.","['Catteau-Jonard, Sophie', 'Brunel, Anne', 'Dumont, Agathe', 'Robin, Geoffroy', 'Pigny, Pascal', 'Dewailly, Didier']","['Catteau-Jonard S', 'Brunel A', 'Dumont A', 'Robin G', 'Pigny P', 'Dewailly D']","['Department of Endocrine Gynecology and Reproductive Medicine, University of Lille, CHU de Lille, 59000 Lille, France; Inserm U1172 Team 2, JPARC, University of Lille, 59000 Lille, France.

Pre hospital medical management and hospital admission difficulties were systematically recorded and analyzed. A regional survey was also performed in clinical and radiological departments, which are likely to receive these patients in emergency situations. RESULTS: During the period of study, 92 patients were managed by the PEMU. Medical difficulties were numerous: impossibility to measure arterial pressure in 8 patients, difficulties in peripheral line placement for 12 patients, difficult airway management in 5 of 25 (20%) patients requiring tracheal intubation. The handling of obese patients needed additional rescuer in 27 (33%) patients transported to hospital. The regional survey showed that many obese patients could not profit from several specialized diagnostic and therapeutics devices because of their weight restriction.

These results deserve confirmation in studies with more patients followed for a longer term.","['Bessemans, Severine', 'Scheen, Andre J']","['Bessemans S', 'Scheen AJ']","['Service de diabetologie, nutrition et maladies metaboliques, Departement de medecine, CHU de Liege, 4000 Liege, Belgique.', 'Service de diabetologie, nutrition et maladies metaboliques, Departement de medecine, CHU de Liege, 4000 Liege, Belgique.']",['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Rev Med Suisse,Revue medicale suisse,101219148,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Lipids)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bariatric Surgery/methods', 'Blood Glucose', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*etiology', 'Female', 'Gastrectomy/*methods', 'Gastric Bypass/*methods', 'Gastroplasty/*methods', 'Humans', 'Lipids/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/complications/*surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Weight Loss']",,,,"['Les auteurs remercient les differentes equipes chirurgicales du CHU de Liege et', 'du CHR de la Citadelle qui ont realise les differentes procedures de chirurgie', 'bariatrique, les membres des equipes multidisciplinaires qui ont mis au point et', ""suivi les patients operes et Madame Monique Marchand pour l'aide dans l'analyse"", 'statistique des donnees.']",2017/07/04 06:00,2018/04/11 06:00,['2017/07/04 06:00'],"['2017/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Med Suisse. 2016 Aug 24;12(527):1378-1382.,,,,,,,,,Efficacite de trois techniques de chirurgie bariatrique chez des sujets obeses diabetiques de type 2.,,,,,,,,,,,

Early post-surgical enhancement of insulin secretion is key for diabetes remission. The full complement of mechanisms responsible for improved pancreatic beta cell functionality after bariatric surgery is still unclear. Our aim was to identify pathways, evident in the islet transcriptome, that characterize the adaptive response to bariatric surgery independently of body weight changes. METHODS: We performed entero-gastro-anastomosis (EGA) with pyloric ligature in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice as a surrogate of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in humans. Multiple approaches such as determination of glucose tolerance, GLP-1 and insulin secretion, whole body insulin sensitivity, ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and functional multicellular Ca(2+)-imaging, profiling of mRNA and of miRNA expression were utilized to identify significant biological processes involved in pancreatic islet recovery. FINDINGS: EGA resolved diabetes, increased pancreatic insulin content and GSIS despite a persistent increase in fat mass, systemic and intra-islet inflammation, and lipotoxicity. Surgery differentially regulated 193 genes in the islet, most of which were involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism, insulin secretion, calcium signaling or beta cell viability, and these were normalized alongside changes in glucose metabolism, intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics and the threshold for GSIS. Furthermore, 27 islet miRNAs were differentially regulated, four of them hubs in a miRNA-gene interaction network and four others part of a blood signature of diabetes resolution in ob/ob mice and in humans. INTERPRETATION: Taken together, our data highlight novel miRNA-gene interactions in the pancreatic islet during the resolution of diabetes after bariatric surgery that form part of a blood signature of diabetes reversal.

No data, however, are available on the effects of the weight loss induced by vertical sleeve gastrectomy on sympathetic neural drive, insulin sensitivity, and their reciprocal cross talks. In 10 severe obese hypertensives (age, 54.0+/-2.3 years [mean+/-SEM]), we measured sphygmomanometric blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, homeostatic model assessment index, plasma leptin, muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (microneurography), and baroreflex sensitivity (vasoactive drug technique). Measurements were performed 2 to 3 days before surgery and repeated 6 and 12 months after the procedure. Ten matched hypertensive obeses not undergoing gastrectomy served as controls. Six months after bariatric surgery, a significant (P<0.05) reduction in body mass index (-9.1+/-1.4 kg/m(2)), sphygmomanometric systolic blood pressure (-10.2+/-4.5 mm Hg), heart rate (-11.0+/-2.4 bpm), homeostatic model assessment index (-3-3+/-1.3 AU), plasma leptin (-53.6+/-8.8 mug/L), and muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (-15.0+/-3.4 bursts/100 heart beats) was observed. The weight loss, the plasma leptin reduction, and the sympathetic inhibition were maintained after 12 months, whereas homeostatic model assessment index showed a tendency to return toward presurgery values. A significant improvement in baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve traffic was observed both 6 (+32.1%; P<0.05) and 12 months (+60.7%; P<0.01) after gastrectomy. No significant changes in the above-mentioned variables were detected in the control group. These data provide evidence that massive weight loss induced by sleeve gastrectomy triggers profound sympathoinhibitory effects, associated with a stable and significant reduction in plasma leptin levels, whereas the improvement in insulin sensitivity was attenuated with time and unrelated to the sympathoinhibition.","['Seravalle, Gino', 'Colombo, Manuela', 'Perego, Paolo', 'Giardini, Vittorio', 'Volpe, Marco', ""Dell'Oro, Raffaella"", 'Mancia, Giuseppe', 'Grassi, Guido']","['Seravalle G', 'Colombo M', 'Perego P', 'Giardini V', 'Volpe M', ""Dell'Oro R"", 'Mancia G', 'Grassi G']","['From the Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Milan, Italy (G.S., G.M.); Clinica Medica, Department of Health Science (M.C., M.V., R.D., G.G.) and Chirurgia II (P.P., V.G.), University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy; Centro Interuniversitario di Fisiologia Clinica e Ipertensione, Milan, Italy (G.M., G.G.); and IRCCS Multimedica, Sesto San Giovanni, Milan, Italy (G.G.).', 'From the Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Milan, Italy (G.S., G.M.); Clinica Medica, Department of Health Science (M.C., M.V., R.D., G.G.) and Chirurgia II (P.P., V.G.), University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy; Centro Interuniversitario di Fisiologia Clinica e Ipertensione, Milan, Italy (G.M., G.G.); and IRCCS Multimedica, Sesto San Giovanni, Milan, Italy (G.G.).', 'From the Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Milan, Italy (G.S., G.M.); Clinica Medica, Department of Health Science (M.C., M.V., R.D., G.G.) and Chirurgia II (P.P., V.G.), University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy; Centro Interuniversitario di Fisiologia Clinica e Ipertensione, Milan, Italy (G.M., G.G.); and IRCCS Multimedica, Sesto San Giovanni, Milan, Italy (G.G.).', 'From the Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Milan, Italy (G.S., G.M.); Clinica Medica, Department of Health Science (M.C., M.V., R.D., G.G.) and Chirurgia II (P.P., V.G.), University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy; Centro Interuniversitario di Fisiologia Clinica e Ipertensione, Milan, Italy (G.M., G.G.); and IRCCS Multimedica, Sesto San Giovanni, Milan, Italy (G.G.).', 'From the Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Milan, Italy (G.S., G.M.); Clinica Medica, Department of Health Science (M.C., M.V., R.D., G.G.) and Chirurgia II (P.P., V.G.), University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy; Centro Interuniversitario di Fisiologia Clinica e Ipertensione, Milan, Italy (G.M., G.G.); and IRCCS Multimedica, Sesto San Giovanni, Milan, Italy (G.G.).', 'From the Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Milan, Italy (G.S., G.M.); Clinica Medica, Department of Health Science (M.C., M.V., R.D., G.G.) and Chirurgia II (P.P., V.G.), University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy; Centro Interuniversitario di Fisiologia Clinica e Ipertensione, Milan, Italy (G.M., G.G.); and IRCCS Multimedica, Sesto San Giovanni, Milan, Italy (G.G.).', 'From the Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Milan, Italy (G.S., G.M.); Clinica Medica, Department of Health Science (M.C., M.V., R.D., G.G.) and Chirurgia II (P.P., V.G.), University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy; Centro Interuniversitario di Fisiologia Clinica e Ipertensione, Milan, Italy (G.M., G.G.); and IRCCS Multimedica, Sesto San Giovanni, Milan, Italy (G.G.).', 'From the Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Milan, Italy (G.S., G.M.); Clinica Medica, Department of Health Science (M.C., M.V., R.D., G.G.) and Chirurgia II (P.P., V.G.), University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy; Centro Interuniversitario di Fisiologia Clinica e Ipertensione, Milan, Italy (G.M., G.G.); and IRCCS Multimedica, Sesto San Giovanni, Milan, Italy (G.G.). guido.grassi@unimib.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hypertension,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",7906255,['0 (Leptin)'],IM,"['Bariatric Surgery', 'Baroreflex/physiology', 'Blood Pressure/*physiology', 'Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'Heart Rate/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/complications/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Insulin Resistance/*physiology', 'Leptin/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/complications/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/*physiopathology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Weight Loss/physiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['bariatric surgery', 'baroreflex', 'body weight', 'insulin resistance', 'leptin', 'obesity', 'sympathetic nervous system']",,2014/05/29 06:00,2014/10/18 06:00,['2014/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.02988 [pii]', '10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.02988 [doi]']",ppublish,Hypertension. 2014 Aug;64(2):431-7. doi: 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.02988.

This article considers whether obesity's effects on self-concept linger when obese youth enter the normal body mass range. Using longitudinal data from the National Growth and Health Study on 2,206 black and white girls, we estimated a parallel-process growth mixture model of body mass linked to growth models of body image discrepancy and self-esteem. We found that discrepancy was higher and self-esteem lower in formerly obese girls compared to girls always in the normal range and comparable to chronically obese girls. Neither body image discrepancy nor self-esteem rebounded in white girls despite reduction in body mass, suggesting that the effects of stigma linger. Self-esteem, but not discrepancy, did rebound in black girls.","['Mustillo, Sarah A', 'Hendrix, Kimber L', 'Schafer, Markus H']","['Mustillo SA', 'Hendrix KL', 'Schafer MH']","['Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA. smustillo@purdue.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Health Soc Behav,Journal of health and social behavior,0103130,,IM,"['Black or African American/*psychology', '*Body Image', '*Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mental Health', 'Obesity/epidemiology/psychology', '*Prejudice', 'Psychometrics', 'Self Concept', '*Social Stigma', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'White People/*psychology', ""Women's Health""]",,,,,2012/03/03 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2012/03/03 06:00'],"['2012/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['53/1/2 [pii]', '10.1177/0022146511419205 [doi]']",ppublish,J Health Soc Behav. 2012 Mar;53(1):2-16. doi: 10.1177/0022146511419205.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although both frequently occur together in the same individual, obesity and the metabolic syndrome can also develop independently from each other. The (patho)physiology of ""metabolically healthy obese"" (i.e. obese without metabolic syndrome) and ""metabolically unhealthy non-obese"" phenotypes (i.e. non-obese with metabolic syndrome) is not fully understood, but physical activity and sedentary behavior may play a role. OBJECTIVE: To examine objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behavior across four groups: I) ""metabolically healthy obese"" (MHO); II) ""metabolically unhealthy obese"" (MUO); III)""metabolically healthy non-obese"" (MHNO); and IV) ""metabolically unhealthy non-obese"" (MUNO). METHODS: Data were available from 2,449 men and women aged 40-75 years who participated in The Maastricht Study from 2010 to 2013. Participants were classified into the four groups according to obesity (BMI>/=30kg/m2) and metabolic syndrome (ATPIII definition). Daily activity was measured for 7 days with the activPAL physical activity monitor and classified as time spent sitting, standing, and stepping. RESULTS: In our study population, 562 individuals were obese. 19.4% of the obese individuals and 72.7% of the non-obese individuals was metabolically healthy. After adjustments for age, sex, educational level, smoking, alcohol use, waking time, T2DM, history of CVD and mobility limitation, MHO (n = 107) spent, per day, more time stepping (118.2 versus 105.2 min; p<0.01) and less time sedentary (563.5 versus 593.0 min., p = 0.02) than MUO (n = 440). In parallel, MHNO (n = 1384) spent more time stepping (125.0 versus 115.4 min; p<0.01) and less time sedentary (553.3 versus 576.6 min., p<0.01) than MUNO (n = 518). CONCLUSION: Overall, the metabolically healthy groups were less sedentary and more physically active than the metabolically unhealthy groups.

Extremely obese patients often have special health needs, such as lower extremity edema or respiratory insufficiency that require targeted evaluation and treatment.

One hundred and fourteen obese women aged from 18 to 40 years were divided into insulin sensitive (IS) and insulin resistant (IR) groups and received a low calorie diet (LC), or an isocaloric diet and 500 mg metformin twice daily (IM), or isocaloric diet with 120 mg orlistat three times daily (IO). Before and after the intervention anthropometric parameters, serum lipid profile, serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, insulin, glucose, IGF-1, HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment), and visceral adiposity index (VAI), and their changes were registered. Although the reductions in weight and body fat were comparable in IS and IR groups, only women with IR showed a significant increase in IGF-1 concentration as a result of all interventions.

MEASUREMENTS: A questionnaire exploring beliefs about the causes, attitudes, perceptions of responsibility and reported weight management practices. RESULTS: Physical inactivity was identified as an important causative factor for both overweight and obesity. Mood, eating too much of the wrong foods, repeated dieting and interpersonal factors were also seen as relatively important for both groups. Attitudes were mixed, but were generally neutral to positive. The most negative attitudes were described in terms of perceived reduced self-esteem, sexual attractiveness and health. Dietitians rated obese people more negatively than overweight people. They viewed both overweight and obese people as being responsible for their excess weight. They also reported very similar management practices for overweight and obese people. Beliefs about the causes of overweight explained more of the variance in practice than dietitians' attitudes towards or perceived responsibility of overweight and obese people. However, these associations were not consistent and strong, and other factors not investigated here are likely to have a greater influence on weight management practices.","['Harvey, E L', 'Summerbell, C D', 'Kirk, S F L', 'Hill, A J']","['Harvey EL', 'Summerbell CD', 'Kirk SF', 'Hill AJ']","['Centre for Research in Primary Care, Nuffield Institute, Leeds, UK. e.l.harvey@leeds.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hum Nutr Diet,Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,8904840,,IM,"['Affect', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Diet', 'Diet, Reducing', '*Dietetics', 'Exercise', 'Humans', 'Obesity/etiology/psychology/*therapy', '*Perception', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,,,2002/09/25 06:00,2002/11/28 04:00,['2002/09/25 06:00'],"['2002/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['385 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-277x.2002.00385.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Hum Nutr Diet. 2002 Oct;15(5):331-47. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-277x.2002.00385.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study, which took place from 2009 to 2011, included every obese pregnant woman (prepregnancy BMI greater than 30 kg/m(2)) who had an ultrasound examination at 20 to 24 weeks in our hospital and a control group with a normal BMI (20-24.9kg/m(2)) who had the same examination. A single operator evaluated the quality of all images, reviewing the standardized ultrasound planes - three biometric and six anatomical - required by French guidelines and scoring the quality of the six anatomical images. Each image was assessed according to 4-6 criteria, each worth one point. We sought excellent quality, defined as the frequency of maximum points for a given image. RESULTS: The obese group included 223 women and the control group 60. The completion rate for each image was at least 95 % in the control group and 90 % in the obese group, except for diaphragm and right outflow tract images. Overall, the excellence rate varied from 35 % to 92 % in the normal BMI group and 18 % to 58 % in the obese group and was significantly lower in the latter for all images except abdominal circumference (P=0.26) and the spine (P=0.06).

However, studies of BPD effect in BMI range 25.0 to 34.9 kg/m, including about 90% of diabetic patients, are lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: If BPD effects are independent of weight changes, they should be maintained in patients who, being mildly obese or overweight, will lose little or no weight after operation. Thirty type 2 diabetic patients with BMI 25 to 34.9 were submitted to BPD and monitored 12 months. Thirty-eight diabetic patients selected from a large database, kept 1 year on medical therapy, served as controls. RESULTS: Nineteen male and 11 female. Mean age 56.4 +/- 7.4 years, weight 84.8 +/- 11.1 kg, BMI 30.6 +/- 2.9 kg/m, waist circumference 104 +/- 9.4 cm, diabetes duration 11.2 +/- 6.9 years, HbA1c 9.3+/-1.5. Twelve patients on insulin. Fifteen (2 F) with BMI < 30 (mean: 28.1). No mortality or major adverse events occurred. BMI progressively decreased, stabilizing around 25 since the fourth month, without excessive weight loss. One year after BPD, mean HbA1c was 6.3%+/-0.8, with 25 patients (83%) controlled (HbA1c</=7%) on free diet, without antidiabetics, and the remaining improved. Acute insulin response to intravenous glucose had increased from 1.2 +/- 2.9 to 4.2 +/- 4.4 muIU/mL. Diabetes resolution correlated positively with BMI. HbA1c decreased at 1 year in the control group, along with an overall increased amount of antidiabetic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: BPD improves or resolves diabetes in BMI 25 to 35 without causing excessive weight loss, its action being on insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function. The strikingly different response between morbidly obese and low BMI patients might depend on different beta-cell defect.

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Data (n = 7075) from the Third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used for this investigation. To assess risks of hypertension and/or diabetes that were due to different fat patterns, odds ratios of men and women with various cut-points of adiposities were compared with normal subjects in logistic regression models, adjusting for age, smoking, and alcohol intake. To evaluate the contribution of ethnic differences in obesity to the risks of HDC, we compared blacks and Hispanics with whites. RESULTS: Generalized and abdominal obesities were independently associated with increased risk of hypertension, diabetes and HDC in white, black, and Hispanic men and women. The risk of HDC due to generalized, truncal, and abdominal obesities tended to be higher in whites than blacks and Hispanics. In men, the contribution of black and Hispanic ethnicities to the increased risk of HDC due to the various obesity phenotypes was approximately 73% and approximately 61%, respectively. The corresponding values for black and Hispanic women were approximately 115% and approximately 125%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to advocating behavioral lifestyles to curb the epidemic of obesity among at-risk populations in the United States, there is also the need for primary health care practitioners to craft their advice to the degree and type of obesity in these at-risk groups.","['Okosun, I S', 'Chandra, K M', 'Choi, S', 'Christman, J', 'Dever, G E', 'Prewitt, T E']","['Okosun IS', 'Chandra KM', 'Choi S', 'Christman J', 'Dever GE', 'Prewitt TE']","['Department of Community Medicine, Mercer University School of Medicine, Macon, Georgia 31207, USA. okosun_i@mercer.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Obes Res,Obesity research,9305691,,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/*anatomy & histology', 'Adult', 'Black or African American', 'Aged', 'Body Mass Index', 'Comorbidity', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nutrition Surveys', 'Obesity/*complications/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Phenotype', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Skinfold Thickness', 'United States/epidemiology', 'White People']",,,,,2001/05/11 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/05/11 10:00'],"['2001/05/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/oby.2001.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Obes Res. 2001 Jan;9(1):1-9. doi: 10.1038/oby.2001.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Forty obese individuals between 18 and 60 years of age with altered respiratory function were enrolled. Spirometric values, plethysmograph volumes, arterial blood gases, and nighttime respiratory polygraphs were recorded. Following psychological and nutritional evaluation, the patients commenced year-long treatment for obesity involving a personalized diet and psychological counseling. Follow-up was weekly and individualized at first; in later sessions, patients were grouped. Lung function tests were repeated after loss of 5 kg. Sleep polygraphy was repeated after loss of 10 kg. RESULTS: Weight loss over 15 kg was achieved by 48.6% of the patients. Respiratory function variables: FVC, FEV1, RV, ERV, PaO2 and SatO2 after treatment changed significantly from initial levels. Significant differences were also seen in the severity of sleep apnea and pressures needed for continuous positive airway pressure. Uric acid, glucose and triglyceride blood levels became normal in 89%, 61% and 50% of the patients, respectively, after weight loss. No characteristic psychological profile was identified for severe obesity, although levels of anxiety, eating behavior, marital adjustment and perception of body image were aspects that were fundamentally altered. CONCLUSIONS: In the difficult group of obese patients with BMI > or = 35, interdisciplinary treatment has proven effective for achieving substantial weight loss, while improving respiratory function and severity of sleep disorder. This therapy, which is at present viable for few centers, deserves consideration in the interest of benefiting the increasing number of obese patients.","['Luque, R', 'Berdejo, R', 'Elbusto, A', 'Arrazola, X', 'Royo, I', 'Salegi, I', 'del Campo, L', 'de la Torre, P']","['Luque R', 'Berdejo R', 'Elbusto A', 'Arrazola X', 'Royo I', 'Salegi I', 'del Campo L', 'de la Torre P']","['Servicio de Neumologia, Hospital Aranzazu, Donostia.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Arch Bronconeumol,Archivos de bronconeumologia,0354720,,IM,"['Adult', '*Body Mass Index', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/diagnosis/pathology/physiopathology/*therapy', '*Patient Care Team/statistics & numerical data', 'Psychopathology', 'Weight Loss']",,,,,2000/03/22 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/22 09:00'],"['2000/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0300-2896(15)30212-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0300-2896(15)30212-x [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Bronconeumol. 2000 Feb;36(2):77-83. doi: 10.1016/s0300-2896(15)30212-x.,,,,,,,,,Valoracion de la eficacia de un tratamiento multidisciplinario en un grupo de pacientes obesos con IMC > o = 35 y alteracion de la funcion pulmonar.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: A quantitative, prospective, longitudinal, cross-sectional study was carried out on 21 men with morbid obesity between March 2005 and March 2007. Inclusion criteria were: aged 20 to 50 years, body mass index (BMI) = 40 kg/m(2) and failure in attempts of clinical treatment for obesity in the previous two years. Data collection from clinical records and the administering of a specific questionnaire on issues relating to sexual function was performed prior to and six months following surgery. Scores were analyzed with the help of the Epi-Info 6 program, using the Student's t-test for paired samples. RESULTS: The total score increased at the six-month post operative in 76.19%; remained unaltered in 14.29%; and decreased in 9.52%. Scores in areas related to erectile function and sexual relations increased in 71.42%; sexual desire increased in 52.38%; and orgasms increased in 28.57%. General sexual satisfaction increased in 57.14%. The average total score and scores on the domains of the questionnaire prior to and six months following surgery revealed statistically significant differences, except those relating to sexual desire and orgasm. CONCLUSION: The quality of sexual life in morbid obese men improves following Fobi-Capella surgery. Favorable changes occurred in sexual function after these individuals underwent this type of bariatric surgery.","['Araujo, Araken Almeida de', 'Brito, Ana Maria de', 'Ferreira, Moacir de Novaes Lima', 'Petribu, Katia', 'Mariano, Maria Helena de Araujo']","['Araujo AA', 'Brito AM', 'Ferreira Mde N', 'Petribu K', 'Mariano MH']","['Departamento de Cirurgia, Faculdade de Ciencias Medicas, Universidade de Pernambuco, PE, BR. arakenaa@elogica.com.br']",['por'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Brazil,Rev Col Bras Cir,Revista do Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes,7809515,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Gastroplasty/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*surgery', 'Prospective Studies', '*Quality of Life', '*Sexuality', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,,,2010/01/16 06:00,2010/05/26 06:00,['2010/01/16 06:00'],"['2008/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0100-69912009000100009 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-69912009000100009 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Col Bras Cir. 2009 Feb;36(1):42-8. doi: 10.1590/s0100-69912009000100009.,,,,,,,,,Modificacoes da qualidade de vida sexual de obesos submetidos a cirurgia de Fobi-Capella.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The participant sample consisted of 81 adolescents (age: 11-16 years) who had been referred to a children's hospital for evaluation of obesity or who responded to a community advertisement. Participants were assigned randomly to exercise therapy, an equal-contact exercise placebo intervention, or usual care. Intervention participants attended 3 one-on-one sessions per week for 8 weeks and then completed a home program for another 6 weeks. Outcomes included self-perceptions (self-esteem), depression, affect, physical activity, aerobic fitness, and BMI. RESULTS: A total of 18 of 81 participants were categorized as morbidly obese (BMI SD score: > 3.5; adult equivalent BMI: > or = 40). At baseline, 30.3% of participants had a Children's Depression Inventory score of > or = 13, and 27% reported recent suicidal ideation. Repeated-measures mixed analysis of covariance (controlling for baseline scores) revealed significant changes in physical self-worth, associated measures of self-esteem, and physical activity over time, consistently favoring exercise therapy. There were no significant changes in BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Findings confirmed psychopathologic conditions as a serious health concern in obese and morbidly obese adolescents.

In the present study we evaluated the degree of insulin resistance and first-phase insulin secretion of beta-cell in obese subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and T2DM in Chinese. A total of 220 subjects underwent standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT). Insulin sensitivity index (S I) was assessed by the reduced sample number (n = 12) of Bergman's minimal model method with FSIGT. Insulin secretion capacities were determined by the insulinogenic index (I 30 min - I 0 min)/(G 30 min - G 0 min) in OGTT and the acute insulin response to glucose (AIR) in FSIGT. The disposition index (DI), the product of AIR and S I was used to determine whether AIR was adequate to compensate for insulin resistance. The S I in healthy lean control group was significantly higher than that in NGT, IGT, and T2DM group, but there was no significant difference among NGT, IGT, and T2DM group.

Preliminary findings in obese subjects.,1097-102,10.1016/j.nut.2008.05.017 [doi],"OBJECTIVE: We correlated dietary profile and markers of visceral and somatic obesities in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. METHODS: Patients with histologically proven fatty infiltration of the liver (n = 25, 52 +/- 11 y of age, 64% women) underwent abdominal computed tomography, bioelectrical impedance, and anthropometric measurements. Insulin resistance was evaluated (homeostasis model assessment) and dietary intake of macronutrients was estimated by 24-h recall. Main outcome measurements were correlation of carbohydrate and fat ingestion with liver histology. RESULTS: Metabolic syndrome was present in 72% of the population, and increased waist circumference and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol occurred in 66%. Total body fat (bioimpedance) and dietary intake of lipids were higher in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (P < 0.05), but not in diabetic subjects who exhibited more steatosis than non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Waist circumference exhibited a good correlation with homeostasis model assessment, total energy intake, and ingestion of specific fatty acids. Body mass index correlated well with somatic and visceral adiposities. CONCLUSION: Energy intake and visceral adiposity were predisposing factors for fatty liver disease. Lipid input correlated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in the entire group and after stratification for diabetes. These findings suggest that lipid intake may play a greater role in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis than hitherto suspected.","['Vilar, Lisis', 'Oliveira, Claudia P M S', 'Faintuch, Joel', 'Mello, Evandro S', 'Nogueira, Monize A', 'Santos, Telma E', 'Alves, Venancio A F', 'Carrilho, Flair J']","['Vilar L', 'Oliveira CP', 'Faintuch J', 'Mello ES', 'Nogueira MA', 'Santos TE', 'Alves VA', 'Carrilho FJ']","['Hospital das Clinicas and Sao Paulo University Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nutrition,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",8802712,"['0 (Dietary Fats)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Anthropometry', 'Body Composition/drug effects/physiology', 'Cholesterol/*blood', 'Dietary Fats/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Energy Intake/*physiology', 'Fatty Liver/epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intra-Abdominal Fat/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome/blood/complications/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/blood/*complications/metabolism', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,2008/07/22 09:00,2009/01/30 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2007/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0899-9007(08)00259-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.nut.2008.05.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Nutrition. 2008 Nov-Dec;24(11-12):1097-102. doi: 10.1016/j.nut.2008.05.017.

We have already shown that more than 40% of non diabetic obese subjects have alterations of parasympathetic control of heart rate (HR) variations. The present study aimed to investigate parasympathetic and sympathetic cardiovascular control by using spectral analysis. Sixty-two non diabetic obese subjects were compared to 38 sex-matched healthy controls. Spectral analysis was performed by Anapres system and identified two particular peaks: the one of high frequency (0.20-0.25 Hz) for heart rate variations during controlled breathing which depends on parasympathetic activity, the other of low frequency (around 0.10 Hz) for systolic BP variations in the standing position which mainly depend on sympathetic activity. In control subjects the amplitude of the high frequency peak (r = -0.556, p < 0.0001) but not the amplitude of the low frequency peak correlated negatively with age. In the obese subjects both the high and low frequency peaks correlated negatively with age (r = -0.249; p = 0.05 and r = -0.289, p = 0.036 respectively) and did not correlate with body mass index. The high frequency peak was significantly lower than in controls (4.80 +/- 3.37 (SD) vs 8.38 +/- 4.14; p < 0.0001). In the 25 obese subjects over 40 years the low frequency peak was also significantly lower than in controls (10.00 +/- 3.10 vs 11.95 +/- 4.25; p < 0.05). This study suggests that 1) age must be taken into account when interpreting the cardiovascular parameters under vagosympathetic control; 2) in non diabetic obese subjects vagal activity is decreased and in those over 40 years sympathetic activity is also decreased.","['Sibony-Prat, J', 'Paries, J', 'Chabert, M', 'Attali, J R', 'Valensi, P']","['Sibony-Prat J', 'Paries J', 'Chabert M', 'Attali JR', 'Valensi P']","[""Service d'endocrinologie-diabetologie-nutrition, hopital Jean-Verdier, Bondy.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss,Archives des maladies du coeur et des vaisseaux,0406011,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Autonomic Nervous System Diseases/*physiopathology', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Determination/instrumentation', 'Cardiovascular System/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/complications/*physiopathology', 'Plethysmography', 'Spectrum Analysis']",,,,,1997/08/01 00:00,1997/12/24 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/12/24 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss. 1997 Aug;90(8):1155-8.,,,,,,,,,Alteration du controle vagosympathique cardiovasculaire evalue par l'analyse spectrale des variations de frequence cardiaque et de pression arterielle chez les obeses.,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The survey was carried out on 36 obese boys (ages = 12-16 years) who stayed in the medical center for at least four months. Eighteen of them were trained with the SELF method (the SELF-training is global, progressive, adapted to each boy, controlled and takes place within a ten-week period with five sessions a fortnight, each session lasting 30 to 40 minutes). The parameters that were studied concerned auxology, breathing function exploration, aerobic and anaerobic capacities, muscle strength and psychomotor qualities; the subjective effects of the training were estimated with a questionnaire about life quality, and the hand test. At inclusion the results were reported to a standard kind of population. At the end of the training the results of the 18 boys that were trained were compared to those of the 18 controls. RESULTS: Compared to a standard population, the obese children' aerobic capacity is diminished for the maximum power but is identical in absolute value for the VO2 max; their anaerobic capacities, muscle strength and psychomotor capacities are lower and their psyche is affected by the disease. After a three-month training period and after comparison with the 'control' group, there can be noticed a significant improvement in the psychomotor capacities, a major tendency for the improvement of the aerobic capacities and very positive effects on the psyche.

This is possibly linked to the monotony of constant velocity exercises frequently proposed. Consequently, other less monotonous exercises such as the intermittent walk may be more appropriated. OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of this study were to determine if the obese women prefer a constant velocity walk or an intermittent walk, and to analyze the effects of a rehabilitation program based on the intermittent walk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty obese women were recruited. To determine the preferred walk modality, 10 obese women performed a constant velocity walk and an intermittent walk (with a similar duration and velocity) on a treadmill. The preferred walk modality was determined by lower ratings of perceived exertion. Then, these same 10 women participated in a rehabilitation program of 10 weeks (three days per week) consisting of intermittent walks. The 10 other women did not participate in a training program. RESULTS: The ratings of perceived exertion were not significantly different between the two walk modalities. However, the women who participated in a training program increased their maximal distance during a 6 min walking test and they have stabilized theirs anthropometric data. Meanwhile, the untrained women have increased their body mass, body mass index and percentage of body fat. CONCLUSION: The obese patients preferred similarly the constant velocity walk and the intermittent walk, and a rehabilitation program based on an intermittent walk is effective in avoiding the obesity aggravation.","['Coquart, J B J', 'Lemaire, C', 'Douillard, C', 'Garcin, M']","['Coquart JB', 'Lemaire C', 'Douillard C', 'Garcin M']","[""Laboratoire d'etudes de la motricite humaine, universite de Lille-2, 9, rue de l'Universite, 59790 Ronchin, France. jeremy.coquart@univ-lille2.fr""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Endocrinol (Paris),Annales d'endocrinologie,0116744,,IM,"['Adult', '*Body Composition', '*Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Perception', 'Physical Exertion', '*Walking']",,,,,2008/04/22 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/04/22 09:00'],"['2007/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-4266(08)00034-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ando.2008.01.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Endocrinol (Paris). 2008 Jun;69(3):227-30. doi: 10.1016/j.ando.2008.01.006.,,,,,,,,,Effets d'un programme de marche intermittente sur la masse et la composition corporelles de femmes obeses.,,,,,,,,,,,

Caffeine, a stimulant, which can prompt lipolysis, has been applied on the therapy of obesity. Although the interactive combinations between caffeine and certain neurotransmitters has been appreciated recently, but its regulatory mechanisms are still obscure. This study investigated the effect of caffeine on the body fat deposition, and its interactions with brain serotonin and catecholamine in the genetically obese (ob/ob) mice. METHODS: At 12-week of age, obese mice and their lean counterparts (+/?) were administered with caffeine (4 mg/d) in water for 4 weeks. The brain neurotransmitters levels and body fat content were measured. RESULTS: The obese mice without caffeine treatment had lower brain norepinephrine and epinephrine levels than the lean controls. And there had no difference between obese and lean mice in brain levels of serotonin, tryptophan, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Caffeine treatment showed no effect on the food intake, but decreased the body fat content significantly in obese mice. Mice with caffeine treatment showed increase of the levels of brain neurotransmitters in both phenotypes; this effect was more predominant in obese mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that the effect of caffeine to decrease body fat deposition in the obese mice might be associated with the recovered increases of sympathetic activity.","['Chen, M D', 'Lin, W H', 'Song, Y M', 'Lin, P Y', 'Ho, L T']","['Chen MD', 'Lin WH', 'Song YM', 'Lin PY', 'Ho LT']","['Department of Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China (Republic : 1949- ),Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei),Zhonghua yi xue za zhi = Chinese medical journal; Free China ed,0005327,"['0 (Catecholamines)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Brain/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Caffeine/*pharmacology', 'Catecholamines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Obese', 'Obesity/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serotonin/*metabolism']",,,,,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei). 1994 May;53(5):257-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only few studies on obesity's impact on bone metabolism are available. Bone mineral density at forearm and serum osteocalcin levels, a specific and sensitive marker of bone turn-over, in a group of postmenopausal obese women with those of a nonobese control group were compared. Obese women showed higher densitometric measurements than nonobese, but only the values of the third distal site of forearm resulted higher in a significant way. Serum osteocalcin values were similar between the two groups but the obese women showed a greater dispersion of the values (8.15 +/- 4.96 ng/ml) compared to nonobese (8.35 +/- 1.63 ng/ml).

SUBJECTS: Lean and genetically obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats were used. DESIGN: Lean animals (30-60 d old) were fed for 30 d with standard chow pellets or with a hypercaloric cafeteria diet. Genetically obese rats were fed with standard chow pellets. MEASUREMENTS: Enzyme activity, protein (Western blot) and mRNA (Northern blot) contents of CPS and GS were measured in liver homogenates. RESULTS: In genetically obese animals CPS mRNA content was higher, and GS mRNA content was lower than in control animals; CPS protein content did not change and CPS activity was lower than in control rats. Diet-obese rats had higher levels of CPS and GS mRNAs than control animals; GS protein content and activity was higher than in the control group and at the same time, CPS activity was very low. CONCLUSIONS: In the genetically obese animals the expression of CPS and GS is mainly regulated at the pre-translational level, whereas in the diet obese rats there is a noticeable post-translational component. A reciprocal regulation between CPS and GS can be established at pre-translational levels, whereas at post-transcriptional levels it cannot. It can be concluded that in diet-obese animals the mechanisms involved in retaining nitrogen (low CPS activity) are modulated at the post-translational level.","['Roig, R', 'Esteve, M', 'Remesar, X', 'Lamers, W H', 'Arola, L', 'Salvado, J']","['Roig R', 'Esteve M', 'Remesar X', 'Lamers WH', 'Arola L', 'Salvado J']","['Department de Bioquimica i Biotecnologia, Facultat de Quimica, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord,International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,9313169,"['63231-63-0 (RNA)', '7664-41-7 (Ammonia)', 'EC 6.3.1.2 (Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase)', 'EC 6.3.4.16 (Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Ammonia))', 'N762921K75 (Nitrogen)']",IM,"['Ammonia/*metabolism', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern/methods', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Ammonia)/genetics/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase/genetics/metabolism', 'Liver/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Nitrogen/metabolism', 'Obesity/*enzymology/genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Overnutrition', 'RNA/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Zucker', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,1997/08/01 00:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.ijo.0800460 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord. 1997 Aug;21(8):681-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.ijo.0800460.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results show the high frequency of microalbuminuria in non-diabetic obese patients.

Numerous polymorphisms of the apolipoprotein B gene have been described. Particularly, a polymorphism of insertion/deletion located in the coding part of the signal peptide of apoB, associated with modifications of lipid concentrations and the risk of cardiovascular disease, has been reported in the general population. Since obesity is frequently associated with dyslipidemias, the aim of our study was to assess the effect of the insertion/deletion polymorphism of the apolipoprotein B gene on lipid levels in obese subjects. 234 unrelated caucasian obese subjects (74 men and 160 women, aged 39.3 +/- 10.5, BMI : 32.8 +/- 4.7) were recruited. The insertion/deletion polymorphism was determined by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels after PCR amplification. The relative frequencies of the Ins and Del alleles were 0.71 and 0.29 respectively. These frequencies were similar to those found in other Caucasian populations. In the whole population, individuals with the Del/Del genotype had significantly higher total-cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratios (p = 0.004), LDL-cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratios (p = 0.01) and TG-VLDL levels (p < 0.05). They also showed a tendency for higher triglyceride levels (p = 0.09) and lower HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein AI and LpAI levels. The allele deletion results in the absence of three amino acids (Leu-Ala-Leu) in the signal peptide of apo B. In the obese people, these structural changes may have some effect on lipid metabolism and cause variation in serum lipid concentrations.","['Jemaa, R', 'Mebazaa, A', 'Fumeron, F']","['Jemaa R', 'Mebazaa A', 'Fumeron F']","['Laboratoire de biochimie, Hopital la Rabta, Tunis.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Biol Clin (Paris),Annales de biologie clinique,2984690R,"['0 (Apolipoproteins)', '0 (Apolipoproteins B)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apolipoproteins/*blood', 'Apolipoproteins B/*genetics', 'Cholesterol/*blood', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Obesity/*blood/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic']",,,,,2004/03/30 05:00,2004/08/31 05:00,['2004/03/30 05:00'],"['2004/03/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/30 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Biol Clin (Paris). 2004 Mar-Apr;62(2):183-8.,,,,['Copyright John Libbey Eurotext 20003.'],,,,,Polymorphisme insertion/deletion du gene de l'apolipoproteine B: effet sur les concentrations lipidiques chez les sujets obeses.,,,,,,,,,,,

The obese patients have been divided into two groups, normo (NO) and hyperinsulinemic (HO), according to the total insulin response during OGTT. We considered HO patients with insulin response higher than M + 2DS of controls. Obese patients showed, in comparison to the controls, a lower specific binding and higher degree of insulin resistance. The subdivision of obese patients allowed us to distinguish two groups. The first was characterized by basal hyperinsulinemia, normal insulin response to the stimulus, reduced number of insulin receptors and normal or slightly reduced sensitivity. The second group showed high basal and after stimulus insulinemic values, reduced number of insulin receptors and high level of insulin resistance. When we compared the two groups of obeses we found that the first has a shorter duration of obesity and lower blood glucose values after OGTT. However both groups show the same reduction of insulin bound and the same degree of basal hyperinsulinemia. These data suggest that a reduction of insulin receptors is not the main factor responsible for insulin resistance in obesity. Furthermore, the presence of basal hyperinsulinemia and normal insulin sensitivity in our first group suggests that the modification of basal insulin concentrations is not dependent on the presence of insulin resistance.","['Carducci Artenisio, A', 'Ragonese, F', 'Forte, F', 'Saitta, G', 'Perrone, G', 'Lettina, G', 'Campisi, R', 'Consolo, F']","['Carducci Artenisio A', 'Ragonese F', 'Forte F', 'Saitta G', 'Perrone G', 'Lettina G', 'Campisi R', 'Consolo F']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,J Endocrinol Invest,Journal of endocrinological investigation,7806594,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (C-Peptide)', '0 (Insulin)', '9007-92-5 (Glucagon)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Glucose/metabolism', 'C-Peptide/blood', 'Glucagon/blood', 'Glucose Tolerance Test', 'Humans', 'Hyperinsulinism/complications/*metabolism', 'Insulin/blood', '*Insulin Resistance', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/complications/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Insulin/*metabolism']",,,,,1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03348483 [doi]'],ppublish,J Endocrinol Invest. 1985 Jun;8(3):233-9. doi: 10.1007/BF03348483.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One such line of evidence is that pharmacological inhibition of brain GABA transaminase (GABA-T) produces dose-dependent anorexia in otherwise normal rats. To determine the generality of these findings we tested the ability of the GABA-T inhibitor ethanolamine-O-sulfate (EOS), to produce anorexia in three animal models of obesity: rats with medial hypothalamic lesions, rats exposed to palatable foods or Zucker fatty rats. Following intracisternal injection of 100, 200 or 400 micrograms EOS, all three models of chronic overeating showed dose-dependent anorexia of similar magnitude and duration to that seen in appropriate controls.

We propose a new multidisciplinary program of two years with in hospital-stay and ambulatory follow-up which is showing some promising results (90% of success at one year).","['Gaillard, S', 'Barthassat, V', 'Pataky, Z', 'Golay, A']","['Gaillard S', 'Barthassat V', 'Pataky Z', 'Golay A']","[""Service d'enseignement therapeutique pour maladies chroniques, Centre collaborateur de I'Organisation mondiale de la sante, Departement de medecine communautaire et de premier recours HUG, 1211 Geneve 14.

But hypoxemia due to shunt effect can either be corrected by global improvement of alveolar ventilation VA or persist and become worse by low pulmonary volume ventilation which lowers VA/Q. The effect of bradypnoea on 11 elderly patients with moderate obesity has been evaluated by simultaneous measurements of blood gases, ventilatory output coefficients, gas flow rate and steady state transfer for CO. Although hypo-VA disappeared in bradypnoea, hypoxemia persisted in 5 cases, the increase of P(Aa)O2 was accentuated in 7 cases, VCO always remained in deficit compared with VCO2 (in healthy subjects at rest, VCO and VCO2 are interrelated by a proportionally constant whatever the respiratory regimen: VCO/VCO2 = specific VCO, or VCO Sp). The VCO/VA variation correlated negatively with the P(Aa)O2 variation. This study: 1) confirms the link between PaCO2 and VT and the persistence of shunt effect bradypnoea compatible with the deficit of VCO versus VCO2; 2) distinguishes the efficiency of bradypnoea in ventilation and in alveolo-capillary exchange; 3) compares the variations of VCO Sp with those of PaO2 in relation to VT; 4) defines the characteristics of respiratory insufficiency in the obese and bronchitic subjects examined, and 5) specifies the value of VCO Sp measurement in testing the controlled ventilation technique used.","['Breant, J', 'Fleury, M F', 'Goudin, J', 'Bance, N']","['Breant J', 'Fleury MF', 'Goudin J', 'Bance N']","[""Service d'Insuffisants respiratoires, La Musse, Saint Sebastien de Morsent.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Pneumol Clin,Revue de pneumologie clinique,8406312,['7U1EE4V452 (Carbon Monoxide)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Gas Analysis', 'Bronchitis/*complications/physiopathology', 'Carbon Monoxide/metabolism', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*complications/physiopathology', '*Pulmonary Gas Exchange', 'Respiration', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/*etiology/physiopathology']",,,,,1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Pneumol Clin. 1993;49(5):199-208.,,,,,,,,,Echanges en ventilation spontanee et dirigee d'obeses bronchiteux chroniques.

The following conclusions come out of this study. The greater the obesity, the greater the adipocyte volume. There is a positive correlation between the importance of obesity and cellularity of the adipose tissue. However, this correlation is no longer found for the most obese patients, in whom adipocyte hypertrophy intervenes but no longer the multiplication of the fat cells. The onset of obesity at adolescence pairs with a number of adipocytes higher than in the other chronological forms: obesity appearing at adolescence would be thus more frequently hyperplastic. This characteristic is not discovered in the cases of obesity appearing in infancy. No relation was found between the existence of impaired glucose tolerance and mean adipocyte diameter and/or the number of adipocytes. It has been the same for the cases of hyperlipidemia.","['Lubetzki, J', 'Roussel, C', 'Mosse, A', 'Duprey, J', 'Warnet, A', 'Bargy, D']","['Lubetzki J', 'Roussel C', 'Mosse A', 'Duprey J', 'Warnet A', 'Bargy D']",,['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Pathol Biol (Paris),Pathologie-biologie,0265365,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Lipids)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/cytology/*pathology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Anthropometry/methods', 'Blood Glucose/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Female', 'Glucose Tolerance Test', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lipids/blood', 'Male', 'Obesity/*pathology']",,,,,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pathol Biol (Paris). 1980 Jan;28(1):17-24.,,,,,,,,,Morphologie du tissu adipeux.

These two forms of obesity were compared and contrasted with normal animals maintained on 2.5% fat diet for life. The comparison was based on individual growth, age-realted fat, water and defatted dry weight of carcasses and their distribution of weights within larger populations. Young animals on diets containing 8% fat showed an elevated accumulation of fat but not of water. Individual variations lead to an abnormally distributed population where in some animals the excess in weight was characterized by an excessive fat and lean body mass and in others by an excess fat only. Some animals showed no excessive weight when compared to animals maintained on 2.5% fat. The rapid gain in weight which followed a successful injection with gold thioglucose showed a normal distrubution and was correlated with an accumulation of fat in young and adult animals. A significant retention of water was observed only in adults. The relative merits of these obesities as models for human regulatory obesities are briefly discussed.","['De Laey, P']",['De Laey P'],,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Belgium,Arch Int Pharmacodyn Ther,Archives internationales de pharmacodynamie et de therapie,0405353,"['0 (Dietary Fats)', '2P2V9Q0E78 (Aurothioglucose)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/metabolism', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Aurothioglucose/pharmacology', 'Body Water/metabolism', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Dietary Fats/adverse effects', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Hypothalamus/*physiopathology', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Obesity/chemically induced/*physiopathology', 'Organ Size/drug effects']",,,,,1975/08/01 00:00,1975/08/01 00:01,['1975/08/01 00:00'],"['1975/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Int Pharmacodyn Ther. 1975 Aug;216(2):288-314.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is frequently associated with psychological difficulties that may interfere with treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 22 obese female adolescents, aged 13 to 19 years, and 24 age-matched female controls, were compared with regard to emotional pathology (anxiety, depression), eating behaviors, self-esteem, body image and parental history of depression. The evaluation was both categorical (DSM III-R criteria) and dimensional for depression and anxiety. It also included a self-esteem scale and questionnaires. RESULTS: The obese adolescents had more depressive symptoms, more prevalent anxiety disorders, more frequent histories of parental depression, eating behaviors characterized by over-eating and/or restricted intake, lower self-esteem and dissatisfaction with their body image, leading to avoidance behaviors in some of them. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological manifestations, although they are still insufficiently documented, especially in adolescents, may aggravate obesity and interfere with treatment.","['Isnard-Mugnier, P', 'Vila, G', 'Nollet-Clemencon, C', 'Vera, L', 'Rault, G', 'Mouren-Simeoni, M C']","['Isnard-Mugnier P', 'Vila G', 'Nollet-Clemencon C', 'Vera L', 'Rault G', 'Mouren-Simeoni MC']","[""Service de Psychiatrie de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent de l'Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris.""]",['fre'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",France,Arch Fr Pediatr,Archives francaises de pediatrie,0372421,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Adolescent Behavior', 'Anxiety Disorders/psychology', 'Body Image', 'Depressive Disorder/psychology', '*Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*psychology', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Self Concept']",,,,,1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Fr Pediatr. 1993 Jun-Jul;50(6):479-84.,,,,,,,,,Etude controlee des conduites alimentaires et des manifestations emotionnelles dans une population d'adolescentes obeses.,,,,,,,,,,,

They review the indications for this type of operations and the effects the operation has on the body. It has been possible to find 85 other cases in the literature. In general the pregnancy proceeds well but it is important to carry out very strict supervision of the electrolyte balance, of the hypoprotinaemia and of the blood count. Mechanical complications of the short-circuit operation are rare. While abortions and premature labours are not more frequent in these than in other cases the child is often moderately small-for-dates. Congenital malformations can be raised and are of the order of 7 per cent. These fetal abnormalities, as well as maternal digestive troubles, are definitely more frequent if the interval between the operation and the pregnancy is short. It is therefore preferable to wait for two years before allowing a woman who has had a short-circuit type of operation to become pregnant.","['Monnier, J C', 'Buvat, J', 'Proye, C', 'Le Coutour, X', 'Dansette, A', 'Boulogne, M', 'Lanciaux, B', 'Dognin, C', 'Baviere, H', 'Fourneau, A']","['Monnier JC', 'Buvat J', 'Proye C', 'Le Coutour X', 'Dansette A', 'Boulogne M', 'Lanciaux B', 'Dognin C', 'Baviere H', 'Fourneau A']",,['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,J Gynecol Obstet Biol Reprod (Paris),"Journal de gynecologie, obstetrique et biologie de la reproduction",0322206,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ileum/*surgery', 'Jejunum/*surgery', 'Obesity/*surgery', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/*physiopathology']",,,,,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Gynecol Obstet Biol Reprod (Paris). 1980;9(5):543-7.,,,,,,,,,La grossesse chez les obeses ayant subi une derivation jejuno-ileale.,,,,,,,,,,,

In the normal subject, this flow, in the subcutaneous space, occurs between two networks joined by drainage veins. The responsible motor forces are multiple (residual arteriolar pressure, negative transmural pressure) (effect of compression). In the obese patient, hypertrophy of the adipose tissue-mass damages the drainage veins and provokes stasis, evolving in two stages: at first the disorders are reversible (venous dilatation); then definitive tissular damage occurs (epidermis, plexus, veins, muscles, fatty masses). This disintegration accounts for the clinical symptoms (oedema, varicose veins, trophic disorders). There are three conclusions to be drawn from this: adiposity will always be accompanied by venous insufficiency; it is dangerous to make a long-overweight patient reduce weight; adiposity must be treated very early on.","['Lemaire, R']",['Lemaire R'],,['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Phlebologie,Phlebologie,0376212,,IM,"['Blood Circulation', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*physiopathology', 'Veins/*physiopathology']",,,,,1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Phlebologie. 1988 Jul-Oct;41(3):493-9.,,,,,,,,,L'ecoulement du sang veineux chez les obeses.,,,,,,,,,,,

The weight of all obese subjects was at least 20% higher than the ideal weight. Catecholamine excretion was determined a few days after hospitalization to minimize the influence of environmental changes. Spectrofluorimetric estimation of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the urine was carried out according to the method of von Euler and Lihajko. Statistical analysis of the results showed a significant increase in both adrenaline and noradrenaline excretion in the group of obeses subjects compared with the diabetics. The increased catecholamine excretion may represent the response of the adrenal medulla to the stress of the disease. Such an increase may be responsible for perpheral insulin resistence and hence acts as a diabetogenic factor. The results obtained emphasize the influence of catecholamines on insulin responsiveness, possibly constituting a major contribution to the diabetic state.","['Giorgino, R', 'Nardelli, G M', 'Scardapane, R']","['Giorgino R', 'Nardelli GM', 'Scardapane R']",,['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Diabete Metab,Diabete & metabolisme,7604157,"['X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)', 'YKH834O4BH (Epinephrine)']",IM,"['Adrenal Medulla/physiopathology', 'Adult', 'Diabetes Mellitus/physiopathology/*urine', 'Epinephrine/*urine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Norepinephrine/*urine', 'Obesity/physiopathology/*urine']",,,,,1976/03/01 00:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['1976/03/01 00:00'],"['1976/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '1976/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Diabete Metab. 1976 Mar;2(1):11-3.,,,,,,,,,Excretion urinaire des catecholamines chez les sujets obeses et chez les diabetiques.,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Women undergoing induction of labor at term were categorized into three groups: Group 1 (body mass index (BMI) < 30 kg/m(2)), Group 2 (30 < BMI < 40 kg/m(2)), and Group 3 (BMI >/= 40 kg/m(2)). External EFM tracings were reviewed from the time of induction of labor until amniotomy; the percentage of time off of EFM was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using commercially available software. RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-seven patients were stratified into the following groups: 104 patients in Group 1, 156 patients in Group 2, and 77 in Group 3. No significant differences were found between groups when analyzed for gestational age, bishop score, parity, race, and 5 min APGAR less than 7 or admission to the NICU. The mean percentage unmonitored by EFM was 5% for Group 1, 7% for Group 2 and 11% for Group 3. There was a significant association between percent of time unmonitored by EFM and BMI (r = 0.344 p < .0001). CONCLUSION: At term gestation, the fetuses of obese women spend more time unmonitored by external intrapartum EFM than non-obese women. This represents a disparity among a high-risk group that may result in poor pregnancy outcomes if fetal distress is present.","['Brocato, Brian', 'Lewis, David', 'Mulekar, Madhuri', 'Baker, Susan']","['Brocato B', 'Lewis D', 'Mulekar M', 'Baker S']","['a Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , University of South Alabama , Mobile , AL , USA.', 'b Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , Louisiana State University - Shreveport , Shreveport , LA , USA.', 'c Department of Mathematics and Statistics , University of South Alabama , Mobile , AL , USA.', 'a Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , University of South Alabama , Mobile , AL , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",101136916,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cardiotocography/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Obesity', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Complications', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Electronic fetal monitoring', 'induction of labor', 'obesity', 'term pregnancy']",,2017/08/31 06:00,2019/02/08 06:00,['2017/08/31 06:00'],"['2017/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14767058.2017.1371696 [doi]'],ppublish,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med. 2019 Jan;32(1):92-94. doi: 10.1080/14767058.2017.1371696.

RESULTS: Overall weighted injury prevalence during the previous three months was 77 per 10,000 workers. Age-adjusted injury prevalence was greatest for Construction and Extraction workers (169.7/10,000) followed by Production (160.6) among occupations, while workers in the Construction industry sector (147.9) had the highest injury prevalence followed by the Agriculture/Forestry/Fishing/Mining/Utilities sector (122.1). Overweight and obese workers were 26% to 45% more likely to experience injuries than normal-weight workers. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of injury, highest for Construction workers, gradually increased as body mass index levels increased in most occupational and industry groups.","['Gu, Ja K', 'Charles, Luenda E', 'Fekedulegn, Desta', 'Ma, Claudia C', 'Andrew, Michael E', 'Burchfiel, Cecil M']","['Gu JK', 'Charles LE', 'Fekedulegn D', 'Ma CC', 'Andrew ME', 'Burchfiel CM']","['Biostatistics and Epidemiology Branch, Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Health Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Morgantown, West Virginia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Occup Environ Med,Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,9504688,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Industry/*statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Injuries/*epidemiology', 'Occupations/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', 'Self Report', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC4922363,,,,2016/04/09 06:00,2017/01/19 06:00,['2016/04/09 06:00'],"['2016/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['00043764-201604000-00004 [pii]', '10.1097/JOM.0000000000000670 [doi]']",ppublish,J Occup Environ Med. 2016 Apr;58(4):335-43. doi: 10.1097/JOM.0000000000000670.,['CC999999/Intramural CDC HHS/United States'],,,,,['NIHMS795606'],,,,,,,['NLM: HHSPA795606'],,,,,,,

In Singapore, a national health survey in 1992 showed that 5% of the adult population were obese and 21% were overweight. Obesity causes much morbidity and mortality and treatment is desirable. The majority of obese patients have no known cause but it is essential to exclude any underlying cause before treatment. Antiobesity drugs should be used as an adjunct to an adequate programme of dietary restriction, exercise and behavior modification. Serotonergic drugs and adrenergic agents are available in the treatment of obesity. The short-term efficacy and safety of antiobesity drugs such as fenfluramine and d-fenfluramine are proven. The long-term use of antiobesity drugs used singly or in combination remains to be established. Many peptides (cholecystokinin, glucagon, bombesin, neurotensin, etc) with weight reduction properties are undergoing extensive studies: their clinical applications are experimental. The treatment of obesity is difficult and frustrating and antiobesity drugs have an established short-term role. In morbid obesity where the life of the patient is in danger, surgery such as gastric plication may be life-saving.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study were to review and compare the most recently published influential guidelines on the management of maternal obesity in the preconceptional, antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum period. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A descriptive review of guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists on obesity in pregnancy was carried out. RESULTS: There is an overall agreement among the reviewed guidelines regarding the importance of prepregnancy weight loss with behavioral modification, optimization of gestational weight gain, and screening for comorbidities in improving pregnancy outcomes of obese women. Women with previous bariatric surgery should be screened for nutritional deficiencies and have a closer antenatal surveillance, according to all guidelines. In addition, folic acid supplementation is recommended for 1 to 3 months before conception and during the first trimester, but several discrepancies were identified with regard to other vitamins, iodine, calcium, and iron supplementation. All medical societies recommend early screening for gestational diabetes mellitus and early anesthetic assessment in obese women and suggest the use of aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia when additional risk factors are present, although the optimal dosage is controversial. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists point out that specific equipment and adequate resources must be readily available in all health care facilities managing obese pregnant women. Moreover, thromboprophylaxis and prophylactic antibiotics are indicated in case of cesarean delivery, and intrapartum fetal monitoring is justified during active labor in obese patients. However, there are no consistent protocols regarding the fetal surveillance, the monitoring of multiple gestations, the timing and mode of delivery, and the postpartum follow-up, although weight loss and breastfeeding are unanimously supported. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity in pregnancy is a significant contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity with a constantly rising global prevalence among reproductive-aged women. Thus, the development of uniform international protocols for the effective management of obese women is of paramount importance to safely guide clinical practice and subsequently improve pregnancy outcomes.","['Giouleka, Sonia', 'Tsakiridis, Ioannis', 'Koutsouki, Georgia', 'Kostakis, Nikolaos', 'Mamopoulos, Apostolos', 'Kalogiannidis, Ioannis', 'Athanasiadis, Apostolos', 'Dagklis, Themistoklis']","['Giouleka S', 'Tsakiridis I', 'Koutsouki G', 'Kostakis N', 'Mamopoulos A', 'Kalogiannidis I', 'Athanasiadis A', 'Dagklis T']","['Resident.', 'Consultant in Maternal-Fetal Medicine.', 'Resident.', 'Resident.', 'Professor.', 'Associate Professor.', 'Professor.', 'Assistant Professor, Third Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Obstet Gynecol Surv,Obstetrical & gynecological survey,0401007,['0 (Anticoagulants)'],IM,"['Pregnancy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Adult', '*Obesity, Maternal', 'Anticoagulants', 'Australia/epidemiology', '*Venous Thromboembolism', 'Obesity/complications/epidemiology/therapy']",,,,,2023/01/07 06:00,2023/01/11 06:00,['2023/01/06 09:44'],"['2023/01/06 09:44 [entrez]', '2023/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/OGX.0000000000001091 [doi]'],ppublish,Obstet Gynecol Surv. 2023 Jan;78(1):50-68. doi: 10.1097/OGX.0000000000001091.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this fact, the psychological approach to obese subjects is a fundamental element both in understanding the causal mechanisms but also to follow therapeutic effects in the long run. However, everything cannot be explained by the fact that many nutritionists lack a formation in psychology and many psychiatrists lack interest for corporal diseases. What is missing is a theoretical background allowing each participant to find his/her role in this multifactorial condition which requires a multidisciplinary management. COLLABORATIVE CARE: The nutritionist-psychiatrist pair would appear to be the best choice for a large number of obese subjects who may or may not have eating habit disorders. The type of psychological help will depend on many factors: the subject's background, environment, demands, and most importantly, capacity for mentalization. There are many possibilities for simple supportive care: psychoanalytic approach, behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, etc. The choice of a therapeutic method depends on the clinician's competence and on the subject's characteristics.

Worldwide, an estimated twenty-two million children <5 years of age were overweight in 2007. In the UK if current trends continue an estimated one-quarter of all children <16 years of age will be obese by 2050. Recent evidence suggests that most obesity is established during the preschool years, and because one in five obese 4 year olds will become obese adults this situation has major implications for public health. The causes of obesity in preschool children are complex and multifactorial. Although 30-50% of the predisposition towards obesity in preschool children can be explained by genetic factors, environmental influences also play a crucial role. The preschool period in particular is a pivotal time during which long-term dietary and physical activity habits are established, with potential lifelong effects on health. However, research in this age-group is limited. Previous studies have aimed to improve diet, increase physical activity and achieve behavioural change. However, few of these studies have been successful and there is an urgent need, therefore, for the development of evidence-based interventions aimed at the prevention of preschool obesity.","['Lanigan, Julie', 'Barber, Sally', 'Singhal, Atul']","['Lanigan J', 'Barber S', 'Singhal A']","['The MRC Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, University College London, Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, London WC1N 1EH, UK. j.lanigan@ich.ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Proc Nutr Soc,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,7505881,,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Diet', 'Exercise', '*Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Obesity/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control']",,,,,2010/02/18 06:00,2010/08/13 06:00,['2010/02/18 06:00'],"['2010/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0029665110000029 [pii]', '10.1017/S0029665110000029 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Nutr Soc. 2010 May;69(2):204-10. doi: 10.1017/S0029665110000029.

This is especially a characteristic of children whose both parents are obese. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted using a polling method. Questionnaires were filled out by parents and brothers and sisters, including their body height and weight. The collected data served as the basis for assessing the family nutritional status. RESULTS: Statistical analysis of the results showed that obese children frequently have obese parents, brothers and sisters in regard to normal-weight children. Differences are statistically significant in relation to fathers (p=0.043), i.e. statistically obese schoolchildren have more frequently obese fathers than those of normal nutritional status. Other differences could not be considered significant (p > 0.05). DISCUSSION: Obese children have more often obese parents, brothers and sisters than normal-weight children. It was found that the nutritional status of moderately and extremely obese children was quite different from that of normal-weight children and that there was a statistically significant dependence between the nutritional status of children and their fathers. CONCLUSION: This research showed that family obesity is a potential contributing factor to obesity of schoolchildren.","['Mirilov, Jelena']",['Mirilov J'],['Institut za zastitu zdravlja Novi Sad. miril@neobee.net'],['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Med Pregl,Medicinski pregled,2985249R,,IM,"['Child', 'Family Health', 'Humans', 'Nutritional Status', 'Obesity/etiology/*genetics']",,,,,2006/03/11 09:00,2006/05/11 09:00,['2006/03/11 09:00'],"['2006/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2298/mpns0510486m [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pregl. 2005 Sep-Oct;58(9-10):486-9. doi: 10.2298/mpns0510486m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various genetic, environmental and hormonal factors contribute to obesity. This article reviews the most current understanding of obesity's multifactorial origin and recent recommendations for its management in childhood and adolescence. RECENT FINDINGS: Epigenetics plays a key role in transmitting obesity risk to offspring. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms at genetic loci for adipokines and their receptors are associated with obesity. Gut microbiota is an important regulator of weight status, and Bifidobacterium species improves metabolic status. The incidence of comorbidities including prediabetes and type 2 diabetes has increased. Novel biomarkers such as alpha-hydroxybutyrate and branched-chain amino acids correlate with insulin sensitivity and predict glycemic control in adolescents. Lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy can produce small BMI changes. Bariatric surgery induces substantial weight loss and remission of comorbidities. SUMMARY: Alterations in genetics, epigenetics and microbiota influence childhood obesity. Lifestyle modification remains the mainstay of management and pharmacotherapy with Food and Drug Administration approved medications is recommended only for patients resistant to lifestyle changes and for comorbidities. Bariatric surgery produces sustained weight loss and cardiovascular benefits and is an effective option for adolescents with severe obesity.","['Baskaran, Charumathi', 'Kandemir, Nurgun']","['Baskaran C', 'Kandemir N']","['Pediatric Endocrinology, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes,"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",101308636,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Hormones)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bariatric Surgery', 'Blood Glucose/metabolism', 'Child', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/complications', 'Endocrine System Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Endocrinology/*trends', 'Hormones/physiology', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance/physiology', 'Life Style', 'Obesity, Morbid/blood/complications/diagnosis/therapy', '*Pediatric Obesity/blood/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Weight Loss']",,,,,2017/11/15 06:00,2019/02/07 06:00,['2017/11/15 06:00'],"['2017/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MED.0000000000000381 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes. 2018 Feb;25(1):55-60. doi: 10.1097/MED.0000000000000381.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 4,260 patients with newly diagnosed ALL enrolled from 1988 to 1995 onto five concurrent Children's Cancer Group studies. Results were verified in a second cohort of 1,733 patients enrolled onto a sixth study from 1996 to 2002. RESULTS: The 1988 to 1995 cohort included 343 obese and 3,971 nonobese patients. The 5-year event-free survival rate and risk of relapse in obese versus nonobese patients were 72% +/- 2.4% v 77% +/- 0.6% (P = .02) and 26 +/- 2.4 v 20 +/- 0.6 (P = .02), respectively. After adjusting for other prognostic variables, obesity's hazard ratios (HRs) of events and relapses were 1.36 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.77; P = .021) and 1.29 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.56; P = .04), respectively.

The numbers of obese people are exponentially rising in Europe, and it is projected that in Europe by 2010 there will be 150 million obese people. The obesity-related health crisis does not only affect adults, with one in four European children now overweight. Radiologists, both adult and paediatric, need to be aware of the magnitude of the problem, and obese patients cannot be denied radiologic evaluation due to their size. Missed diagnosis, appointment cancellation and embarrassing situations for patients when they are referred for a radiological examination for which they are not suitable are all issues that can be avoided if careful provision is made to accommodate the needs of the obese patient requiring radiologic evaluation. This paper will discuss the epidemiology of obesity and the role of radiology in the assessment of obesity and disorders of fat metabolism.

The anatomic and physiological changes that occur in obese individuals may have an impact across the spectrum of critical illness. Obese patients may be more susceptible to hypoxemia and hypercapnia. During mechanical ventilation, elevated end-expiratory pressures may be required to improve lung compliance and to prevent ventilation-perfusion mismatch due to distal airway collapse. Several studies have shown an increased risk of organ dysfunction such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury in obese patients. Predisposition to ventricular hypertrophy and increases in blood volume should be considered in fluid management decisions. Obese patients have accelerated muscle losses in critical illness, making nutrition essential, although the optimal predictive equation to estimate nutritional needs or formulation for obese patients is not well established. Many common intensive care unit medications are not well studied in obese patients, necessitating understanding of pharmacokinetic concepts and consultation with pharmacists. Obesity is associated with higher risk of deep venous thrombosis and catheter-associated bloodstream infections, likely related to greater average catheter dwell times. Logistical issues such as blood pressure cuff sizing, ultrasound assistance for procedures, diminished quality of some imaging modalities, and capabilities of hospital equipment such as beds and lifts are important considerations. Despite the physiological alterations and logistical challenges involved, it is not clear whether obesity has an effect on mortality or long-term outcomes from critical illness.

Cardiac autonomic dysfunction (CAD) affects a high proportion of obese patients. CAD could be involved in BP increase. Our aim was to examine the relationship between CAD, HR and BP in obese patients without known diabetes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 428 overweight or obese patients. CAD was assessed by analyzing HR variations during three standard tests (Valsalva, deep breathing, lying-to-standing), which are mostly dependent on vagal control. An oral load in glucose was performed and the Matsuda index was calculated. RESULTS: The population was separated in 4 groups according to the grade of CAD (no or only one abnormal test, 2 or 3 abnormal tests) and HR (< or >/= 75 bpm). Age was similar in the four groups. Systolic (P=0.05), diastolic (P<0.005) and mean BP (P<0.001) differed significantly between the 4 groups, and was the highest in the group of patients who had 2 or 3 abnormal tests and HR >/= 75 bpm. Matsuda index differed across the groups (P=0.018) and was the lowest in this group. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that among overweight or obese patients with a defect in cardiac vagal activity BP is elevated only in those with a high heart rate, which is indicative of a more marked insulin resistance and probably an excess in sympathetic activity.","['Banu, I', 'Nguyen, M T', 'Hamo-Tchatchouang, E', 'Cosson, E', 'Valensi, P']","['Banu I', 'Nguyen MT', 'Hamo-Tchatchouang E', 'Cosson E', 'Valensi P']","[""Service d'endocrinologie-diabetologie-nutrition, hopital Jean-Verdier, Assistance publique-Hopitaux de Paris, CRNH-IdF, universite Paris-Nord, avenue du 14-Juillet, 93143 Bondy cedex, France.

We examined whether obesity's association with novel cardiovascular risk factors such as C-reactive protein (CRP) also varies by race and ethnicity. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We analyzed data from 10,492 white, African-American, and Hispanic-American participants of the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, who were aged 20 years and older, with a BMI > or =18.5 kg/m(2) and CRP < or =10 mg/l. We fit sex-specific multivariable models of the association of BMI or waist circumference with log CRP levels and tested for interactions of BMI or waist circumference with race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Higher BMI was significantly associated with higher CRP in all racial/ethnic groups for both men and women (P > 0.05 for BMI-race/ethnicity interaction) before and after adjustment for age, education, and health behaviors. Larger waist circumference was also associated with higher CRP levels in all racial/ethnic groups before and after adjustment; among women, the relationship was strongest for Mexican Hispanics (P < 0.01 for waist circumference-race/ethnicity interaction). Results were similar after additional adjustment for medications that might affect CRP levels. DISCUSSION: The association between obesity and CRP is at least as strong in African Americans and Hispanic Americans as in white Americans. Racial differences in the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular mortality are unlikely to be due to racial differences in obesity's impact on CRP.","['Wee, Christina C', 'Mukamal, Kenneth J', 'Huang, Annong', 'Davis, Roger B', 'McCarthy, Ellen P', 'Mittleman, Murray A']","['Wee CC', 'Mukamal KJ', 'Huang A', 'Davis RB', 'McCarthy EP', 'Mittleman MA']","['Division of General Medicine and Primary Care, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. cwee@bidmc.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Obesity (Silver Spring),"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",101264860,['9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Black or African American/statistics & numerical data', 'Body Mass Index', 'C-Reactive Protein/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nutrition Surveys', 'Obesity/*blood/*ethnology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Racial Groups/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'White People/statistics & numerical data']",PMC2848449,,,['DISCLOSURE The authors declared no conflict of interest.'],2008/04/02 09:00,2008/06/19 09:00,['2008/04/02 09:00'],"['2008/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['oby20087 [pii]', '10.1038/oby.2008.7 [doi]']",ppublish,Obesity (Silver Spring). 2008 Apr;16(4):875-80. doi: 10.1038/oby.2008.7.

Once obesity develops in genetically predisposed individuals, their obese body weight is avidly defended against chronic caloric restriction. In animals genetically predisposed toward obesity, there are multiple abnormalities of neural function that prime them to become obese when dietary caloric density and quantity are raised. Once obesity is fully developed, these abnormalities largely disappear. This suggests that obesity might be the normal state for such individuals. Formation of new neural circuits involved in energy homeostasis might underlie the near permanence of the obese body weight. Such neural plasticity can occur during both nervous system development and in adult life. Maternal diabetes, obesity, and undernutrition have all been associated with obesity in the offspring of such mothers, especially in genetically predisposed individuals. Altered brain neural circuitry and function often accompanies such obesity. This enhanced obesity may then be passed on to subsequent generations in a feed-forward, upward spiral of increasing body weight across generations. Such findings suggest a form of ""metabolic imprinting"" upon genetically predisposed neural circuits involved in energy homeostasis. Centrally acting drugs used for obesity treatment lower the defended body weight and alter the function of neural pathways involved in energy homeostasis.

METHOD: Researchers performed computerized and manual searches of the literature and summarized the most relevant articles. RESULTS: The growing epidemic of child and adolescent obesity deserves attention for its immediate mental health and long-term medical complications. Mental health professionals working with obese youths should be aware of recent advances in neuroscience, genetics, and etiologies associated with obesity. Those who assess and treat obese youth should view obesity as a chronic disease. Currently, no approved pharmacological or surgical approaches exist to treat childhood obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers should focus on modest weight-loss goals that correlate with significant health benefits. The most effective treatments include substantial parental involvement. Mental health professionals should help obese children build self-esteem to help them lead full lives regardless of weight.","['Zametkin, Alan J', 'Zoon, Christine K', 'Klein, Hannah W', 'Munson, Suzanne']","['Zametkin AJ', 'Zoon CK', 'Klein HW', 'Munson S']","['Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program, Intramural Research Program, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. zametkin@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry,Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,8704565,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', '*Obesity/epidemiology/psychology/therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Self Concept']",,,,,2004/01/17 05:00,2004/03/09 05:00,['2004/01/17 05:00'],"['2004/01/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0890-8567(09)61269-7 [pii]', '10.1097/00004583-200402000-00008 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2004 Feb;43(2):134-50. doi: 10.1097/00004583-200402000-00008.,,,,,,,141,['J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2004 Feb;43(2):151-3.

In addition, the obese individual is often the brunt of social discrimination. Weight loss has been shown to reduce the risk for many of these comorbid conditions. A multifaceted approach to the obese patient should include identifying potential causes for weight gain, outlining medical conditions that would benefit by weight loss, and tailoring a weight loss program that is safe and effective for the individual.

The aim of the present work was to evaluate this activity in normotensive and in mildly hypertensive obese patients, and to correlate this activity with clinical and biological indexes of insulin resistance. Heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (sBP) were examined by spectral analysis in 70 normotensive obese patients (group 1), 32 mildly hypertensive obese patients (group 2), and 21 controls. The high frequency peak of HR variations at a controlled breathing rate (vagal activity) was significantly reduced in both groups (p < 0.001). The mid frequency peak of sBP in the standing position (sympathetic activity) was similar in both groups and in the control group. In groups 1 and 2, the high frequency peak correlated negatively with age (p = 0.005 and 0.034 respectively).

In group 2, the mid frequency peak correlated positively with fasting insulin and insulin resistance index (p = 0.006 and 0.007 respectively). This study shows that, in obese patients: 1. cardiac vagal activity is reduced in normotensive and mildly hypertensive subjects; 2. vascular sympathetic activity is unchanged in means but may be increased as a consequence of adiposity, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, and this increase is likely to be involved in the increase of blood pressure.","['Valensi, P', 'Dabire, H', 'Brahimi, M', 'Paries, J', 'Platon, P', 'Attali, J R']","['Valensi P', 'Dabire H', 'Brahimi M', 'Paries J', 'Platon P', 'Attali JR']","[""Service d'endocrinologie-diabetologie-nutrition, hopital Jean-Verdier, Bondy.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss,Archives des maladies du coeur et des vaisseaux,0406011,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Pressure', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*complications', '*Insulin Resistance', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*complications', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/physiology', 'Vasoconstriction']",,,,,2001/09/29 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/09/29 10:00'],"['2001/09/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/29 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss. 2001 Aug;94(8):941-3.,,,,,,,,,Relations entre activite vagosympathique et insulinoresistance chez les obeses normotendus et moderement hypertendus.,,,,,,,,,,,

Obese children are at risk of developing the (dys)metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovarian syndrome, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnoea. Those with diabetes may have mixed features of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pediatric obesity is the result of persistent adverse changes in food intake, lifestyle, and energy expenditure. It may be because of underlying a genetic syndrome or a conduct disorder. Children living in urban settings often lack safe, affordable, and accessible recreational facilities. Tight educational schedules mean less free time, while computer games and television have become preferred recreational activities. More families are eating out or eating take-out meals and processed foods at home because of pressures of work and time constraints. Consumer advertising targeted at children and the ready availability of vending machines encourage unwise food choices. Some children eat excessively because they are depressed, anxious, sad, or lonely. Often families and obese children are aware of the need for healthy eating and exercise but are unable to translate knowledge into weight loss. Population-based measures such as public education, school meal reforms, child-safe exercise friendly environments, and school-based and community-based exercise programs have been shown to be successful to varying degrees, but there remain individuals who will need special help to overcome obesity. Overeating (e.g. binge eating) may be a manifestation of disordered coping behavior but may also be because of defects in the neural and hormonal control of appetite and satiety. New pharmacological approaches are targeting these areas. We need a coordinated approach involving government, communities, and healthcare providers to provide a continuum of population-based interventions, focused screening, and personalized multidisciplinary interventions for the obese child and family.","['Lee, Warren W R']",['Lee WW'],"[""Department of Paediatric Medicine, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore 229899, Singapore. warren.lee@kkh.com.sg""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Denmark,Pediatr Diabetes,Pediatric diabetes,100939345,,IM,"['Adiposity/physiology', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Comorbidity', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/complications', 'Health Care Costs', '*Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Obesity/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy']",,,,,2008/01/03 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2008/01/03 09:00'],"['2008/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['PDI337 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-5448.2007.00337.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Diabetes. 2007 Dec;8 Suppl 9:76-87. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-5448.2007.00337.x.,,,,,,,154,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A computerized search of English language articles published between 1990 and June 2009 yielded 32 articles suitable for review. Based on these articles, obesity was estimated to account for between 0.7% and 2.8% of a country's total healthcare expenditures. Furthermore, obese individuals were found to have medical costs that were approximately 30% greater than their normal weight peers. Although variations in inclusion/exclusion criteria, reporting methods and included costs varied widely between the studies, a lack of examination of how and why the excess costs were being accrued appeared to be a commonality between most studies.

This raises questions whether obesity 'per se' enhances the risk for cardiovascular or metabolic diseases and whether healthy obese subjects would benefit from a medical treatment. In order to answer these questions, as a first step, an expert consensus should be reached for the definition of metabolic normality. In fact, up to now, different parameters related to the metabolic syndrome and/or to insulin sensitivity have been utilized across studies. Once an agreement is reached, population-based studies should be undertaken to establish the incidence of metabolic normality among obese subjects. Furthermore, many other parameters such as age, sex, race, fat distribution and physical activity should be monitored to obtain results representative of a general population. Longitudinal studies aimed at investigating the evolution of the cardiometabolic profile of healthy obese subjects are also needed. In conclusion, data from the literature strongly suggest that a regular surveillance of the cardiometabolic parameters and a prevention of any further weight gain should be applied to healthy obese individuals, whereas possible benefits of a weight loss treatment are still a matter of debate.","['Pataky, Z', 'Bobbioni-Harsch, E', 'Golay, A']","['Pataky Z', 'Bobbioni-Harsch E', 'Golay A']","['Department of Community Medicine, WHO Collaborating Centre, University Hospitals of Geneva and University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Int J Obes (Lond),International journal of obesity (2005),101256108,,IM,"['Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance/genetics/physiology', 'Intra-Abdominal Fat/physiology', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome/diagnosis', '*Obesity/complications/epidemiology/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Weight Loss']",,,,,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/04/13 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['ijo2010235 [pii]', '10.1038/ijo.2010.235 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Obes (Lond). 2010 Dec;34 Suppl 2:S18-23. doi: 10.1038/ijo.2010.235.,,,,,,,,['Int J Obes (Lond). 2012 Jan;36(1):164; author reply 165.

This has led us to tailor One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (BAGUA) to achieve better results in this group of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 83 (37 diabetic and 46 nondiabetic BMI 30 and up) patients who completed all evaluation appointment (preoperative, 10 days, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months) after tailored BAGUA for diabesity. We used the Tanita body composition analyzer BC-420 MA by the method of single frequency impedance to analyze the evolution of BC in patients classified by BMI 30 - 34,9, 35 - 50, and >50. RESULTS: While preoperative excess weight presented dramatic decreases after tailored BAGUA in all the groups, super obese have different final BC. Diabetics retained more fat mass and visceral fat, where super obese have double (14 kg) that simple obese patients (6 kg), they lost more muscle mass, and have higher basal metabolism. The final BC is altered in all parameters if diabetes is added. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of the preoperative excess weight is motivated largely by the tailored effect of BAGUA. Patients BMI 30-50 behaved homogeneous in BC after surgery while patients BMI >50 behave different. Super obese lose less weight, retained more fat mass, visceral fat, bone mass, and total water. This effect should be treated by more aggressive surgery by measuring the entire small intestine to make a proper exclusion (tailored) to achieve homogeneous effects.","['Garcia-Caballero, M', 'Reyes-Ortiz, A', 'Garcia, M', 'Martinez-Moreno, J M', 'Toval-Mata, J-A-']","['Garcia-Caballero M', 'Reyes-Ortiz A', 'Garcia M', 'Martinez-Moreno JM', 'Toval-Mata JA']","['Dept. of Surgery University Malaga, Spain.. gcaballe@uma.es.', 'Dept. of Surgery University Malaga, Spain.. alexxanderhola@yahoo.com.mx.', 'Dept. of Surgery University Malaga, Spain.. manugarciasillero@gmail.com.', 'Dept. of Surgery University Malaga, Spain.

A review of recent studies shows that patients treated by a comprehensive group behavioural programme lose approximately 9% of their initial weight in 20 weeks and, without further treatment, maintain a loss of 5% 1 year later. Methods of improving the maintenance of weight loss include increasing physical activity, extending the length of behavioural treatment and, with appropriately selected individuals, combining behavioural and pharmacological interventions.

We hypothesized that endometrial proteomic differences exist between obese (OW; body mass index [BMI] >/=30 kg/m(2)) and normal-weight women (NWW; BMI, 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)). DESIGN: Clinical cross-sectional study. SETTING: Academic Medical Center. PATIENT(S): Healthy, normally-cycling, 18 to 40-year-old women (n = 6 OW and n = 6 NWW). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Participants underwent screening and midfollicular phase visits. Demographic and anthropometric characteristics, blood samples, ultrasounds, and follicular phase endometrial biopsies were collected. Proteomic analyses of endometrial samples (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) were performed. Proteins with >/=2-fold difference and a false discovery rate of <0.1 were considered statistically significant (Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment). RESULT(S): Reproductive hormone levels did not differ between the two groups. Mean BMI, serum leptin concentration, and bioelectrical impedance analysis indices of adiposity were higher in OW than in NWW. Histological examination of the endometrial samples confirmed normal-appearing endometrium in both OW and NWW. A total of 2,930 proteins were detected across all samples, with an average number of proteins per sample of 2,059 +/- 482 in NWW and 2,437 +/- 187 in OW. A total of 17 proteins were differentially expressed in OW vs. NWW; 2 were more abundant, whereas 15 were underexpressed in OW, including the progesterone receptor. CONCLUSION(S): In this well-phenotyped population of healthy women, obesity was associated with significant endometrial proliferative phase proteomic differences affecting the hormonal and immunologic pathways. These could contribute to an increased risk of menstrual bleeding abnormalities and create an altered environment for future luteinization.","['Giuliani, Emma', 'Schon, Samantha B', 'Yang, Kun', 'Burns, Gregory W', 'Neff, Lisa M', 'Remmer, Henriette A', 'Teixeira, Jose M', 'Marsh, Erica E']","['Giuliani E', 'Schon SB', 'Yang K', 'Burns GW', 'Neff LM', 'Remmer HA', 'Teixeira JM', 'Marsh EE']","['Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, Michigan.', 'Chicago, Illinois.', 'Biomedical Research Core Facilities, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, Michigan.', 'Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Abdominal obesity, a fundamental component of the metabolic syndrome, is not defined by appropriate cutoff points for sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: To provide baseline and reference data on the anthropometry/body composition and the prevalence rates of obesity types and levels in the adult urban population of Kinshasa, DRC, Central Africa. METHODS: During this cross-sectional study carried out within a random sample of adults in Kinshasa town, body mass index, waist circumference and fatty mass were measured using standard methods. Their reference and local thresholds (cut-off points) were compared with those of WHO, NCEP and IFD to define the types and levels of obesity in the population. RESULTS: From this sample of 11 511 subjects (5 676 men and 5 835 women), the men presented with similar body mass index and fatty mass values to those of the women, but higher waist measurements. The international thresholds overestimated the prevalence of denutrition, but underscored that of general and abdominal obesity. The two types of obesity were more prevalent among women than men when using both international and local thresholds. Body mass index was negatively associated with age; but abdominal obesity was more frequent before 20 years of age and between 40 and 60 years old. Local thresholds of body mass index ( > or = 23, > or = 27 and > or = 30 kg/m(2)) and waist measurement ( > or = 80, > or = 90 and > or = 94 cm) defined epidemic rates of overweight/general obesity (52%) and abdominal obesity (40.9%). The threshold of waist circumference > or = 94 cm (90th percentile) corresponding to the threshold of the body mass index > or = 30 kg/m(2) (90th percentile) was proposed as the specific threshold of definition of the metabolic syndrome, without reference to gender, for the cities of sub-Saharan Africa. CONCLUSION: Further studies are required to define the optimal threshold of waist circumference in rural settings. The present local cut-off points of body mass index and waist circumference could be appropriate for the identification of Africans at risk of obesity-related disorders, and indicate the need to implement interventions to reverse increasing levels of obesity.","[""Kasiam Lasi On'kin, J B"", 'Longo-Mbenza, B', 'Nge Okwe, A', 'Kangola Kabangu, N']","[""Kasiam Lasi On'kin JB"", 'Longo-Mbenza B', 'Nge Okwe A', 'Kangola Kabangu N']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kinshasa, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],South Africa,Cardiovasc J Afr,Cardiovascular journal of Africa,101313864,,IM,"['Abdominal Fat/*pathology', 'Adult', 'Body Composition', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Democratic Republic of the Congo/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nutritional Status', 'Obesity/*epidemiology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Prevalence', 'Urban Health/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC3975547,,,,2007/11/07 09:00,2008/05/02 09:00,['2007/11/07 09:00'],"['2007/11/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cardiovasc J Afr. 2007 Sep-Oct;18(5):300-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We examined 19 National Health Interview Survey waves linked to individual National Death Index mortality records, 1986-2006, for age and cohort patterns in the population-level association between obesity and US adult mortality. RESULTS: The estimated percentage of adult deaths between 1986 and 2006 associated with overweight and obesity was 5.0% and 15.6% for Black and White men, and 26.8% and 21.7% for Black and White women, respectively. We found a substantially stronger association than previous research between obesity and mortality risk at older ages, and an increasing percentage of mortality attributable to obesity across birth cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Previous research has likely underestimated obesity's impact on US mortality. Methods attentive to cohort variation in obesity prevalence and age variation in obesity's effect on mortality risk suggest that obesity significantly shapes US mortality levels, placing it at the forefront of concern for public health action.","['Masters, Ryan K', 'Reither, Eric N', 'Powers, Daniel A', 'Yang, Y Claire', 'Burger, Andrew E', 'Link, Bruce G']","['Masters RK', 'Reither EN', 'Powers DA', 'Yang YC', 'Burger AE', 'Link BG']","['At the time of the study, Ryan K.

We thus studied obese subjects with hypertension, diabetes and multiple cardiovascular risk factors. We also studied a group of asymptomatic obese subjects, whom we define as ""the healthy obese"".

We have selected obese patients with venous leg ulceration as an example patient population to explore these questions. BACKGROUND: Anecdotal evidence indicates obesity can increase care requirements and have implications for obesity for care provision. However, little research exists nationally or internationally that provides evidence from a health care perspective. Obesity is a contributory causative factor of lower limb ulceration. In addition to affecting the development of venous leg ulceration, obesity may also impact on the care an obese patient may require and receive. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured in interviews and framework analysis. METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 18 health care professionals and one focus group with 12 health care professionals who cared for patients with venous ulceration. Data were analysed to identify recurring themes relating to the impact of obesity on care provision. RESULTS: This study found that the increasing numbers of obese patients with leg ulcers are currently presenting challenges to care delivery in many different ways. There was an impact of obesity on patient experience in terms of dignity, safety and quality. Data indicated that neither hospital nor community care services were adequately set up to meet the needs of obese patients in general. CONCLUSION: Health care providers need to recognise that increasing numbers of overweight and obese patients are presenting challenges to care delivery. The study also indicated the need for senior strategic leadership in planning for meeting the needs of obese patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nursing is well placed to provide specialist support to co-ordinate services for obese/oversize patients if a suitable strategic and leadership role is developed. Nurses are used to offering patients help in areas of health promotion such as smoking cessation. Lessons learnt from this area could be applied to help and encourage staff to support patients with weight management.","['Lumley, Elizabeth', 'Homer, Catherine V', 'Palfreyman, Simon', 'Shackley, Phil', 'Tod, Angela Mary']","['Lumley E', 'Homer CV', 'Palfreyman S', 'Shackley P', 'Tod AM']","['Sheffield Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust, NIHR CLAHRC-SYH, D-Floor Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK.', 'Centre for Health and Social Care Research, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK.', 'School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.', 'School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.', 'Centre for Health and Social Care Research, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Nurs,Journal of clinical nursing,9207302,,,"['*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Empathy', 'Focus Groups', 'Humans', 'Obesity/complications/psychology/*therapy', 'Qualitative Research', 'Varicose Ulcer/etiology/psychology/*therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['impact on care', 'leg ulcer', 'nursing', 'obesity', 'overweight', 'qualitative research.', 'venous leg ulcers']",,2015/10/16 06:00,2016/09/23 06:00,['2015/10/16 06:00'],"['2015/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jocn.13016 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Nurs. 2015 Dec;24(23-24):3594-604. doi: 10.1111/jocn.13016.

Nearly two-thirds (64.7%) of US adults are overweight or obese. Given the myriad of issues related to the management of obesity, community pharmacists can facilitate weight loss among their patients. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that influence the frequency of counseling obese patients by community pharmacists. METHODS: A mail survey was sent to a random sample of 400 Texas community pharmacists. The questionnaire collected information on frequency of counseling obese patients, perceived comfort level with counseling obese patients, perceived effectiveness of various obesity treatments, and perceived confidence in achieving positive outcomes as a result of counseling. Demographic information was also collected. Descriptive statistics, correlational analyses, and t-tests were used to examine the data. RESULTS: A usable response rate of 35.2% was obtained (139 completed surveys out of 395 assumed delivered). Overall, pharmacists counseled patients rarely to sometimes about various aspects of obesity management. Correlational analyses revealed that pharmacists' frequency of counseling about obesity management was significantly and positively associated with their comfort level with counseling obese patients (r = 0.47; p < 0.001). Higher levels of confidence in achieving positive outcomes as a result of counseling (r = 0.39; p < 0.001) and higher levels of perceived effectiveness of obesity management options (r = 0.18; p = 0.037) were also significantly associated with higher levels of counseling about obesity management.

The association of super-obesity and difficult intubation was not adequately established. OBJECTIVES: To determine if super-obesity and super-super-obesity are associated with difficult intubation or not. SETTING: University Hospital. METHODS: A cohort of obese patients scheduled for bariatric surgery was prospectively recruited. Super-obesity and super-super-obesity were defined as body mass index >/=50 kg/m(2) and 60 kg/m(2), respectively. Intubation difficulty was assessed by 2 methods: (1) intubation difficulty scale; (2) number of intubation attempts. Risk factors for difficult intubation were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analysis for risk factors for difficult intubation and difficult mask ventilation were performed. RESULTS: A total of 658 patients were enrolled in the study including 205 (31%) super-obese and 52 (8%) super-super-obese patients. Ninety-nine (15%) patients required more than 1 intubation attempt, while 215 (33%) patients had intubation difficulty scale >/=5. Ninety-four (14.4%) patients had mask ventilation of moderate difficulty, while only 2 (.3%) patients needed 2-person ventilation. The independent risk factors for difficult intubation using the two stated definitions were STOP-Bang and Mallampati score values. The independent risk factors for mask ventilation of moderate difficulty were STOP-Bang score, Mallampati score, and limited neck extension.

METHODS: Children (N = 184) were randomly assigned to observe a video of a boy or girl in one of three conditions: average-weight, obese, obese with medical information explaining the obesity. They rated stereotypical attitudes on the Adjective Checklist and behavioral intentions on the Shared Activities Questionnaire (SAQ-B). RESULTS: Ratings were generally more favorable for the average-weight than for the obese condition. However, provision of medical information had a positive effect on attitudes toward the obese peer only for younger children and a negative effect on willingness of older children to share academic activities with the peer. Boys and girls showed more positive behavioral intentions toward the same-sex target child regardless of obesity condition. CONCLUSIONS: Information explaining obesity has a minimal positive effect on children's attitudes and behavioral intentions toward a peer presented as obese.","['Bell, S K', 'Morgan, S B']","['Bell SK', 'Morgan SB']","['University of Memphis, Tennessee 38138, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Psychol,Journal of pediatric psychology,7801773,,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', '*Attitude to Health', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/etiology/*psychology', '*Psychology, Child', '*Social Desirability', '*Stereotyping']",,,,,2000/04/26 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/04/26 09:00'],"['2000/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jpepsy/25.3.137 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Psychol. 2000 Apr-May;25(3):137-45. doi: 10.1093/jpepsy/25.3.137.,,,,,,,,['J Pediatr Psychol. 2000 Apr-May;25(3):147-9.

In the Republic of Ireland these costs were estimated at euro1.13 billion for 2009. The total direct healthcare costs for six major obesity related conditions (coronary heart disease & stroke, cancer, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and knee osteoarthritis) in the same year were estimated at euro2.55 billion. The aim of this research is to project disease burden and direct healthcare costs for these conditions in Ireland to 2030 using the established model developed by the Health Forum (UK) for the Foresight: Tackling Obesities project. METHODOLOGY: Routine data sources were used to derive incidence, prevalence, mortality and survival for six conditions as inputs for the model. The model utilises a two stage modelling process to predict future BMI rates, disease prevalence and costs. Stage 1 employs a non-linear multivariate regression model to project BMI trends; stage 2 employs a microsimulation approach to produce longitudinal projections and test the impact of interventions upon future incidence of obesity-related disease. RESULTS: Overweight and obesity are projected to reach levels of 89% and 85% in males and females respectively by 2030. This will result in an increase in the obesity related prevalence of CHD & stroke by 97%, cancers by 61% and type 2 diabetes by 21%. The direct healthcare costs associated with these increases will amount to euro5.4 billion by 2030. A 5% reduction in population BMI levels by 2030 is projected to result in euro495 million less being spent in obesity-related direct healthcare costs over twenty years. DISCUSSION: These findings have significant implications for policy, highlighting the need for effective strategies to prevent this avoidable health and economic burden.","['Keaver, Laura', 'Webber, Laura', 'Dee, Anne', 'Shiely, Frances', 'Marsh, Tim', 'Balanda, Kevin', 'Perry, Ivan J']","['Keaver L', 'Webber L', 'Dee A', 'Shiely F', 'Marsh T', 'Balanda K', 'Perry IJ']","['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Body Mass Index', 'Coronary Disease/etiology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/etiology', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Ireland/epidemiology', 'Male', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Obesity/complications/*economics/*epidemiology', 'Overweight/epidemiology', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Prevalence']",PMC3827424,,,"['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interested', 'exist.']",2013/11/16 06:00,2014/07/26 06:00,['2013/11/16 06:00'],"['2013/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-13-23794 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0079827 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 13;8(11):e79827. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0079827. eCollection 2013.,,20131113,"['PLoS One. 2013;8(12).', 'doi:10.1371/annotation/3dd20b6b-2a94-4542-a058-2cc7effe881a.

A qualitative study.,e12538,10.1111/cob.12538 [doi] e12538,"Understanding the experience of people living with obesity is crucial for delivering holistic care relevant to the socio-cultural context. Although half of the Malaysian adults have excessive weight, the lived experience of people with obesity in the Malaysian context is not well studied. Using the principles of hermeneutic phenomenology, this study explores the lived experience of adults with obesity in Malaysia and their perspective on the environmental influences on obesity. Participants were adults from Peninsular Malaysia living with obesity recruited from social media, clinics and snowball sampling. Twenty-five teleconference interviews in Malay were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed inductively using a reflexive thematic analysis approach, and quotes were translated into English. We identified five themes: (1) Malaysian life is centred around food; (2) social norms shape people living with obesity's perceptions of themselves and obesity; (3) people living with obesity are physically restricted by their body; (4) people living with obesity have repeated thoughts about efforts to lose weight; and (5) stigmatization of people living with obesity leads to negative emotions. Socio-cultural influences were highly impactful on participants' lifeworld, and these influences need to be considered in clinical practice and policy for obesity management in Malaysia. Clinical management should focus on assisting patients in navigating the unsupportive food and social environment instead of overfocusing on the individual's responsibility for weight reduction.","['Yunus, Nor Akma', 'Russell, Grant', 'Muhamad, Rosediani', 'Barton, Chris', 'Sturgiss, Elizabeth']","['Yunus NA', 'Russell G', 'Muhamad R', 'Barton C', 'Sturgiss E']","['School of Primary and Allied Health Care, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Family Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kota Bharu, Malaysia.', 'Department of General Practice, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Family Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kota Bharu, Malaysia.', 'Department of General Practice, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'School of Primary and Allied Health Care, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Obes,Clinical obesity,101560587,,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Malaysia', '*Obesity/psychology', 'Qualitative Research', '*Weight Loss']",PMC9541318,['NOTNLM'],"['Malaysia', 'lived experience', 'obesity', 'phenomenology', 'qualitative']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2022/06/02 06:00,2022/09/17 06:00,['2022/06/01 10:58'],"['2022/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2022/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2022/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/09/17 06:00 [medline]', '2022/06/01 10:58 [entrez]']","['COB12538 [pii]', '10.1111/cob.12538 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Obes. 2022 Oct;12(5):e12538. doi: 10.1111/cob.12538.

In 1993 58% of men and 49% of women were classified as overweight or obese compared with 65% and 58% respectively in 2011; 24% of men and 26% of women were classed as obese in 2011. Body mass index (BMI) is the most commonly used measure to classify people into weight categories. While the use of BMI has limitations, as it does not take into account the difference between muscle and fat, it is a good quick indicator of increased risks. Obesity increases the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. It is also associated with an increased risk of certain cancers. Obesity is an important risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease which if left untreated can progress to severe forms of liver disease, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis. The risk of sleep apnoea is raised in obese individuals as is that for gastro-oesophageal reflux and gallstones, stress incontinence in women and erectile dysfunction in men. Lifestyle weight management programmes should be multicomponent, developed by a multidisciplinary team, and delivered by individuals who have undergone appropriate training. They should focus on long-term weight loss and prevention of weight regain and continue for a minimum of three months. Effective programmes include setting dietary targets, such as specific reductions in energy intake.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Randomized and comparative investigation in overweight or obese outpatient women of the Obesity Clinic, Internal Medicine Institute, Chieti University. PATIENTS: In 1,791 overweight or obese women, randomly selected and stratified by age (41-60 years), blood pressure (BP) was taken with casual measurement in the morning. The entire study group was divided into two subgroups. In the first one, causal BP was measured with a standard-size cuff (RCS), while an appropriate large-size cuff was used for the second one (LCS). Patients of the latter subgroup were also divided by type of obesity (android and gynoid), based on their waist-to-hip ratio. RESULTS: In the LCS subgroup, the hypertension prevalence rate was strikingly lower among overweight and obese women, as well as in the younger and older age groups, when compared with the corresponding RCS subgroups (p < 0.001). The hypertension prevalence rate was higher for all android obese subjects (53%), including younger (34%) and older (64%) groups, when compared with gynoid obese patients (29%, 18% and 42%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A comparison of different reports on the prevalence of hypertension in obesity reveals considerable differences, due mainly to age, sex, race and income level. Nevertheless, our data seem to indicate that even after adjusting for the above-mentioned variables, two significant confounding factors, cuff hypertension and the prevalence of android obesity in the obese study population, could be responsible for over-estimating the prevalence of hypertension. It should be noted that for certain groups of overweight and obese women, the prevalence of hypertension becomes similar to the rate found among the general population, as reported in many large epidemiological surveys.","['Guagnano, M T', 'Palitti, V P', 'Murri, R', 'Marchione, L', 'Merlitti, D', 'Sensi, S']","['Guagnano MT', 'Palitti VP', 'Murri R', 'Marchione L', 'Merlitti D', 'Sensi S']","['Institute of Internal Medicine, University of Chieti, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Panminerva Med,Panminerva medica,0421110,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Pressure Determination/instrumentation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/classification/*complications/pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Somatotypes']",,,,,1998/05/09 00:00,1998/05/09 00:01,['1998/05/09 00:00'],"['1998/05/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Panminerva Med. 1998 Mar;40(1):22-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 381 patients underwent urethroplasty and had complete body mass index (BMI) data. Stricture recurrence-free survival was defined as subjective and objective improvement in urinary flow, an absence of radiographic evidence of stricture, and no further need for urethral instrumentation. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify both univariate and multivariate predictors of urethroplasty outcome. RESULTS: The median patient age was 40 years (range 18-90). The median follow-up was 5.9 years (range 1 month to 10 years). Of the 381 patients, 60 developed recurrent stricture (15.7%). Overweight (BMI 25-30 kg/m(2)) and obese (BMI 30-35 kg/m(2)) patients were more likely to have urethroplasty failure, reaching significance and near significance on univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively (P = .03 and P = .07, respectively). Patients who were severely (BMI 35-40 kg/m(2)) or morbidly obese (BMI >40 kg/m(2)) did not have an increased risk of urethroplasty failure.

Our experimental design compared obesity in three rat strains with the corpulent (cp) mutation. The three strains included Lister and Albany NIH (LAN) rats, Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR) and Dahl Salt Sensitive (DSS) rats that were congenically bred. The strains were selected because of different reported metabolic complications generally clustered with obesity, and defined as the metabolic syndrome. Body weight, food intake, carcass composition, plasma hormones and hypothalamic expression of Y5 receptors were assessed in obese (cp) and lean (wt) rats after adrenalectomy (ADX) or sham surgeries. Plasma corticosterone in sham-operated wtDSS and cpDSS were significantly higher (approx. 165ng/ml) than that in cpLAN and cpSHR (~77 and 68ng/ml respectively). All cp groups had a higher % carcass fat than wt groups. The % carcass fat was greater in cpDSS>cpLAN>cpSHR but plasma leptin was greatest in cpLAN>cpSHR>cpDSS. Hypothalamic expression of the Y5R after ADX resulted in a phenotypexsurgery interaction since Y5R expression was slightly increased in cp rats and slightly decreased in wt rats. The strain with greatest number of metabolic syndrome traits, SHR, was not the fattest of the strains and had little response to ADX. The strains with fewer metabolic syndrome traits LAN and DSS had more extreme obesities which were attenuated after ADX. The results of the current experiment provide evidence that the corpulent mutation is not fully characterized in one strain.","['Brown, Lynda M', 'Hansen, Carl T', 'Huberty, Andrea F', 'Castonguay, T W']","['Brown LM', 'Hansen CT', 'Huberty AF', 'Castonguay TW']","['Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina of Greensboro, Greensboro, NC 27402, United States. lmbrown6@uncg.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Physiol Behav,Physiology & behavior,0151504,"['0 (Leptin)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Neuropeptide Y)', '0 (neuropeptide Y5 receptor)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/pathology', '*Adrenalectomy', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Behavior, Animal/*physiology', 'Body Composition/genetics', 'Body Weight/genetics', 'Corticosterone/blood', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Eating/genetics', 'Hypothalamus/metabolism', 'Leptin/blood', 'Male', 'Metabolic Diseases/*genetics', '*Obesity/blood/genetics/physiopathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Dahl', 'Rats, Inbred SHR', 'Receptors, Neuropeptide Y/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,,,,2011/01/05 06:00,2011/07/02 06:00,['2011/01/05 06:00'],"['2010/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0031-9384(10)00468-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.physbeh.2010.12.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Physiol Behav. 2011 Apr 18;103(1):98-103. doi: 10.1016/j.physbeh.2010.12.020.

However, the natural history of childhood obesity that persists into adulthood suggests that the obese child who becomes an obese adult will have more severe adult obesity than adults whose obesity began in adulthood. Therefore, to the extent that the severity of obesity predicts morbidity, persistence of childhood obesity may be expected to account for a disproportionate share of the adult sequelae of obesity. Fifty-year follow-up studies of a cohort with adolescent obesity have demonstrated that the mortality and morbidity of cardiovascular disease was significantly increased compared with a cohort that was lean throughout adolescence. Furthermore, the effect of adolescent obesity on adult morbidity and mortality appeared independent of the effects of adolescent obesity on adult weight status. Because truncal fat is deposited during adolescence, adolescent onset obesity may entrain both adult obesity and the effects of adolescent onset obesity on mortality and morbidity. These observations suggest that successful treatment of childhood and adolescent obesity is an effective approach to the prevention of severe adult disease. Recently, follow-up of children treated with diet, exercise and behaviour modification showed significantly lower weights 10 years later than children treated in other ways (p < 0.01). These and other family-based treatments appear to be the most appropriate approaches to the treatment of childhood obesity. However, the prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity suggests that even the most successful treatment may be of limited benefit if it relies on the traditional medical model (doctor/patient interaction).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Dietz, W H']",['Dietz WH'],"['Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology/Nutrition, New England Medical Center, Boston, Mass. 02111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Horm Res,Hormone research,0366126,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Diet, Reducing', 'Exercise', 'Humans', 'Obesity/diet therapy/prevention & control/*therapy']",,,,,1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000182791 [doi]'],ppublish,Horm Res. 1993;39 Suppl 3:86-90. doi: 10.1159/000182791.,,,,,,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 606 women, aged 50-64 years, with BMI 30-40 kg/m(2) and no history of cardiovascular or other severe diseases. One group with a CVD risk profile (n = 473) (i.e., cholesterol >7.0 mmol/l, HDL cholesterol <1.2 mmol/l, triglycerides >2.0 mmol/l, systolic or diastolic blood pressure >140/90 mmHg, or waist-to-hip ratio >0.85) was compared with women without such risk (n = 133). Steroid hormones, leptin, insulin, and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were analyzed. A subgroup of women with baseline impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) completed a 2.5-year follow-up OGTT. RESULTS: Fewer obese postmenopausal women with CVD risk had ever used hormone therapy (odds ratio 0.24 [95% CI 0.07-0.75]), after multivariate adjustments. Furthermore, women with CVD risk had a higher testosterone index (1.07 [1.01-1.13]) and more had insulin resistance (1.04 [1.00-1.08]) and IGT (2.92 [1.50-5.69]), while OGTT was similar at follow-up. No differences were observed regarding family history or lifestyle, except that fewer women with CVD risk consumed fruits, boiled vegetables, or whole-grain cereals. More women with CVD risk lived alone (3.26 [1.28-8.31]) and had more mental problems (1.16 [1.05-1.28]). CONCLUSIONS: Previously healthy obese women with a CVD risk profile seemed to have a high risk of diabetes, as well as psychosocial or psychological problems. Hormone therapy was associated with reduced CVD risk. Obesity's growing burden on society makes it more important to further target individuals that are at greatest risk of future health hazards.","['Lidfeldt, Jonas', 'Samsioe, Goran', 'Agardh, Carl-David']","['Lidfeldt J', 'Samsioe G', 'Agardh CD']","['Department of Clinical Sciences/Primary Care/University Hospital MAS, SE-20502 Malmo, Sweden. jonas.lidfeldt@med.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Diabetes Care,Diabetes care,7805975,"['0 (Insulin)', '0 (Leptin)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/blood/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Cholesterol/blood', 'Estradiol/blood', '*Estrogen Replacement Therapy', 'Family Health', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Glucose Intolerance/blood/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Glucose Tolerance Test', 'Humans', 'Insulin/blood', 'Leptin/blood', 'Life Style', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity/blood/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Occupations', 'Psychology', 'Quality of Life', 'Risk Factors', 'Testosterone/blood']",,,,,2006/10/27 09:00,2006/12/16 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['29/11/2477 [pii]', '10.2337/dc06-1262 [doi]']",ppublish,Diabetes Care. 2006 Nov;29(11):2477-82. doi: 10.2337/dc06-1262.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, once a patient develops HF, an elevated BMI appears to confer a survival benefit--a phenomenon termed the ""obesity paradox."" The exact explanation for this paradox has been difficult to ascertain. Numerous plausible mechanisms have been asserted, including the fact that obese patients tend to be younger and more symptomatic, leading them to seek medical attention earlier in the course of their HF. Obese patients may also have larger energy reserves that help to offset the catabolic changes seen with HF. Other hypotheses highlight the limitations of BMI as an obesity classifier. The purpose of this review is to examine the various theories for the obesity paradox in HF and discuss the implications for the clinical management of obese patients with HF.","['Chase, Paul J', 'Davis, Paul G', 'Bensimhon, Daniel R']","['Chase PJ', 'Davis PG', 'Bensimhon DR']","['LeBauer Cardiovascular Research Foundation, Cone Health, 1200 N.

Most importantly, these include difficult access to the airways (intubation, difficult or impossible ventilation), and post-extubation respiratory distress secondary to the development of atelectasis or obstruction of the airways, sometimes associated with the use of morphine derivatives. The association of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) with obesity is very common, and induces a high risk of peri- and postoperative complications. Preoperative OSA screening is crucial in the obese patient, as well as its specific management: use of continuous positive pre, per and postoperative pressure. For any obese patient, the implementation of protocols for mask ventilation and/or difficult intubation and the use of protective ventilation, morphine-sparing strategies and a semi-seated positioning throughout the care, is recommended, combined with close monitoring postoperatively. The dosage of anesthetic drugs should be based on the theoretical ideal weight and then titrated, rather than dosed to the total weight. Monitoring of neuromuscular blocking should be used where appropriate, as well as monitoring of the depth of anesthesia. The occurrence of intraoperative recall is indeed more frequent in the obese patient than in the non-obese patient. Appropriate prophylaxis against venous thromboembolic disease and early mobilization are recommended, as thromboembolic disease is increased in the obese patient. The use of non-invasive ventilation to prevent the occurrence of acute post-operative respiratory failure and for its treatment is particularly effective in obese patients. In case of admission to ICU, an individualized ventilatory management based on pathophysiology and careful monitoring should be initiated.","['De Jong, A', 'Verzilli, D', 'Chanques, G', 'Futier, E', 'Jaber, S']","['De Jong A', 'Verzilli D', 'Chanques G', 'Futier E', 'Jaber S']","[""PhyMedExp, University of Montpellier, Inserm, CNRS, CHU Montpellier, 371 avenue du doyen Gaston Giraud, 34080 Montpellier, France; Departement d'Anesthesie-Reanimation, hopital Saint-Eloi, 80, avenue Augustin-Fliche, 34295 Montpellier cedex, France."", ""Departement d'Anesthesie-Reanimation, hopital Saint-Eloi, 80, avenue Augustin-Fliche, 34295 Montpellier cedex, France."", ""PhyMedExp, University of Montpellier, Inserm, CNRS, CHU Montpellier, 371 avenue du doyen Gaston Giraud, 34080 Montpellier, France; Departement d'Anesthesie-Reanimation, hopital Saint-Eloi, 80, avenue Augustin-Fliche, 34295 Montpellier cedex, France."", 'CHU de Clermont-Ferrand, Department of Perioperative Medicine, GReD, UMR/CNRS6293, University, Clermont Auvergne, Inserm, U1103, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""PhyMedExp, University of Montpellier, Inserm, CNRS, CHU Montpellier, 371 avenue du doyen Gaston Giraud, 34080 Montpellier, France; Departement d'Anesthesie-Reanimation, hopital Saint-Eloi, 80, avenue Augustin-Fliche, 34295 Montpellier cedex, France.

There is increasing agreement that major blood biomarkers are often not discriminatory, as for example, the return to normal blood glucose levels in bariatric patients who do not have long-term benefits. Although weight loss is appreciated to improve metabolic and inflammatory parameters, the cellular and immune factors that couple obesity to cardiometabolic risk are only partially understood. RECENT FINDINGS: Reduced BMI upon successful bariatric surgery does not always result in reduced pericardial fat; certain patients gain ectopic fat, which should be considered an adverse response. There is emerging evidence that pericardial fat volume and brown fat stores may provide individualized patient assessments. SUMMARY: Some obese persons can be relieved of the additional stigma of classification in a major disease category, and unnecessary medical interventions and costs can be reduced. Other patients should be monitored more closely for unexpected adverse outcomes.","['Denis, Gerald V', 'Hamilton, James A']","['Denis GV', 'Hamilton JA']","['Cancer Research Center and Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes,"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",101308636,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/etiology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Health', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Obesity/complications/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*metabolism', 'Risk']",PMC3934493,,,,2013/08/27 06:00,2014/04/01 06:00,['2013/08/27 06:00'],"['2013/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/01.med.0000433058.78485.b3 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes. 2013 Oct;20(5):369-76. doi: 10.1097/01.med.0000433058.78485.b3.,"['P30 DK046200/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK057521/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK090455/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA182898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['NIHMS556176'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Five psychological perspectives on childhood obesity are selected. The boundary model of Herman and Polivy (1980) was brought forward as an explanation model for understanding the overeating behaviour in obese people. Others describe obese children as over-responsive to external cues and this over-responsiveness is seen as a personality trait. Learning theories put forward how (dysfunctional) learning mechanisms can explain also why obese people eat in front of food cues, without feeling hungry. Finally, obesity can be seen as an expression of a family pathology or an emotional problem. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological explanation models are still subject of discussion. Personality variables, eating behaviour, restraint attitudes, psychopathlogy and emotional factors, learning mechanisms as well as the role of the family are to be considered in an assessment process. It may help to better empathize with both parent and child. Furthermore, it can help to tailor the treatment program to the individual needs of an obese child. Further research is needed to find out whether already during the intake psychological indicators can be found that are predictors of negative therapy outcome.","['Braet, C']",['Braet C'],"['Department of Developmental, Personality and Social Psychology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.

As such, they have a special role to play within the organizations in which they work as leaders in the approach to managing obese patients. Recent epidemiological data demonstrate that the prevalence of obesity is beginning to plateau. However, the rate of severe obesity in adults and the prevalence of overweight among children continue to grow, suggesting that in the future there will be an increasing burden of obesity-related illnesses. A number of recent studies have identified a number of novel mechanisms that predispose to obesity including several newly identified genes, the role of intestinal microflora, and even social networks. The selection of treatment for obese patients remains a complex issue. Recent studies demonstrate that a range of dietary approaches including the Atkins diet can provide modest weight loss, although the key feature appears to be adherence in the dietary strategy. High levels of physical activity appear to be necessary to maintain a reduced state, although modest increases in activity improve fitness. Although the new understanding of biology of weight regulation has provided a wide range of potential drug targets, available pharmacotherapy options remain limited although a number of potential targets show promise. Recent data provides the most enthusiasm for surgical treatment of obesity. Several recent studies demonstrate a reduction in mortality and dramatic benefits in diabetes in obese patients treated surgically. Questions remain as to the best surgical approach and the cost effectiveness.

It is now well recognized that obesity is a disease that represents a rapidly growing epidemic. It is often a lifelong problem that preferentially affects women. Modern science and medicine are just beginning to unravel the multifactorial pathophysiology of obesity. Current literature emphasizes the metabolic, hormonal, and behavioral interactions as well as genetic predisposition. This understanding has led to new recommendations for the management of the obese patient and to new pharmaceutical approaches for those at high risk. These risks include diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, gallbladder disease, and osteoarthritis. In addition, there are a number of reproductive health problems unique to obese women. Until recently, however, the evidence for benefit of weight loss was not clear. There are now numerous Category A data indicating significant benefit for weight loss as it affects multiple comorbidities It is, therefore, incumbent upon the providers of women's health care to assess patient risk and to offer resources, guidance, assistance, and reassurance to the overweight and obese patient as she embarks on a program of renewed health through weight loss.

Although nearly half of individuals with BED are obese, BED also occurs in nonobese individuals. Despite the relatively high percentage of weight loss treatment-seeking individuals meeting BED criteria, primary care physicians may not be familiar with or have ever diagnosed BED. Many providers may also have difficulty distinguishing BED as a contributory factor in obesity. This review differentiates BED from other causes of obesity by describing how obese individuals with BED differ from obese individuals without BED and from nonobese individuals with BED in areas including psychopathology, behavior, genetics, physiology, quality of life and productivity. The ways in which health-care providers can identify individuals who may have BED are also highlighted so the proper course of treatment is pursued. Overall, obese individuals with BED demonstrate a number of key characteristics that differentiate them from obese individuals without eating disorders, including increased impulsivity in response to food stimuli with loss of control over eating, resulting in the consumption of more calories. They also experience significant guilt and other negative emotions following a meal. In addition, individuals with BED patients have more psychiatric comorbidity, display more psychopathology, exhibit longer binge durations, consume more meals as snacks during the day and have less dietary restraint compared with individuals with BED who are not obese. However, the differences between individuals with BED who are obese versus not obese are not as prominent. Taken together, the evidence appears to support the conclusion that BED is a unique and treatable neurobehavioral disorder associated with distinct behavioral and psychological profiles and distinct medical and functional outcomes, and that it is not merely a subtype of obesity.","['Montano, C Brendan', 'Rasgon, Natalie L', 'Herman, Barry K']","['Montano CB', 'Rasgon NL', 'Herman BK']","['a Connecticut Clinical Research Center, Private Practice, Internal Medicine , Cromwell , CT , USA.', 'b Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , CA , USA.', 'c Global Medical Affairs , Shire , Wayne , PA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Postgrad Med,Postgraduate medicine,0401147,,IM,"['Binge-Eating Disorder/complications/*diagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Obesity/diagnosis/*etiology', '*Primary Health Care']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Binge eating disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation', 'Obesity', 'Primary care']",,2015/11/26 06:00,2016/05/21 06:00,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/00325481.2016.1115330 [doi]'],ppublish,Postgrad Med. 2016 Jan;128(1):115-23. doi: 10.1080/00325481.2016.1115330.

The World Health Organization characterizes obesity as a pandemic issue, with a higher prevalence in females than males. Thus, many pregnant patients are seen with high body mass index (BMI). Obesity during pregnancy is considered a high-risk state because it is associated with many complications. Compared with normal-weight patients, obese patients have a higher prevalence of infertility. Once they conceive, they have higher rate of early miscarriage and congenital anomalies, including neural tube defects. Besides the coexistence of preexisting diabetes mellitus and chronic hypertension, obese women are more likely to have pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes, thromboembolism, macrosomia, and spontaneous intrauterine demises in the latter half of pregnancy. Obese women also require instrument or Cesarean section delivery more often than average-weight women. Following Cesarean section delivery, obese women have a higher incidence of wound infection and disruption. Irrespective of the delivery mode, children born to obese mothers have a higher incidence of macrosomia and associated shoulder dystocia, which can be highly unpredictable. In addition to being large at birth, children born to obese mothers are also more susceptible to obesity in adolescence and adulthood. Prevention is the best way to prevent this problem. As pregnancy is the worst time to lose weight, women with a high BMI should be encouraged to lose weight prior to conceiving. During preconception counseling, they should be educated about the complications associated with high a BMI. Obese women should also be screened for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. In early pregnancy, besides being watchful about the higher association of miscarriage, obese women should be screened with ultrasound for congenital anomalies around 18 to 22 weeks. The ultrasound should be repeated close to term to check on the estimated fetal weight to rule out macrosomia. Obese pregnant women are screened for gestational diabetes around 24 to 28 weeks. During the second half of pregnancy, one needs to closely watch for signs and symptoms of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Once in labor, an early anesthesia consultation is highly recommended irrespective of delivery mode. When Cesarean section is performed, many obstetricians prefer an incision above the pannus to avoid skin infection. However, the incision should be decided upon the discretion of the surgeon. Peripartum, special attention is given to avoid thromboembolism by using compression stockings and early ambulation.","['Satpathy, Hemant K', 'Fleming, Alfred', 'Frey, Donald', 'Barsoom, Michael', 'Satpathy, Chabi', 'Khandalavala, Jimmy']","['Satpathy HK', 'Fleming A', 'Frey D', 'Barsoom M', 'Satpathy C', 'Khandalavala J']","['Department of OB-GYN, Creighton University Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68105, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Postgrad Med,Postgraduate medicine,0401147,,IM,"['Bariatric Surgery', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', '*Global Health', 'Humans', 'Obesity/complications/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevalence']",,,,,2008/10/01 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/10/01 09:00'],"['2008/10/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3810/pgm.2008.09.1920 [doi]'],epublish,Postgrad Med. 2008 Sep 15;120(3):E01-9. doi: 10.3810/pgm.2008.09.1920.,,20080915,,,,,104,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty obese (OBE) and 27 normal-weight (NW) children and adolescents (age: 9-17) were assessed for body representation using a multi-method approach. Therefore, we assessed body size estimation, tactile size estimation, heartbeat detection accuracy, and attitudes towards one's own body. OBE were examined upon admission and before discharge of an inpatient weight-reduction program. NW served as cross-sectional control group. RESULTS: Body size estimation and heartbeat detection accuracy were similar in OBE and NW. OBE overestimated sizes in tactile size estimation and were more dissatisfied with their body as compared to NW. In OBE but not in NW, several measures of body size estimation correlated with negative body evaluation. After weight-loss treatment, OBE had improved in heartbeat detection accuracy and were less dissatisfied with their body. None of the assessed variables predicted weight-loss success. CONCLUSIONS: Although OBE children and adolescents generally perceived their body size and internal status of the body accurately, weight reduction improved their heartbeat detection accuracy and body dissatisfaction.","['Molbert, Simone Claire', 'Sauer, Helene', 'Dammann, Dirk', 'Zipfel, Stephan', 'Teufel, Martin', 'Junne, Florian', 'Enck, Paul', 'Giel, Katrin Elisabeth', 'Mack, Isabelle']","['Molbert SC', 'Sauer H', 'Dammann D', 'Zipfel S', 'Teufel M', 'Junne F', 'Enck P', 'Giel KE', 'Mack I']","['Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Graduate Training Centre of Neuroscience, International Max Planck Research School, University Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Fachkliniken Wangen i.A., Children Rehabilitation Hospital for Respiratory Diseases, Allergies and Psychosomatics, Wangen i.A., Germany.', 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Body Size', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*pathology/*physiopathology/*psychology/*therapy', '*Weight Loss']",PMC5119783,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2016/11/23 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2016/11/23 06:00'],"['2016/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-16-37718 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0166826 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Nov 22;11(11):e0166826. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0166826. eCollection 2016.,,20161122,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0430-5245'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the prevalence of the disease, numerous therapeutic strategies have been attempted--often unsuccessfully. Weight loss programmes based on dietary restriction of caloric intake and nutritional education, exercise, surgical (gastroplasty, gastric bypass) and procedural (gastric balloon, waist cord, jaw wiring, liposuction) intervention and pharmacotherapy (appetite suppressants, thermogenic agents, bulking agents) used alone or in combination, have produced weight loss in the short to medium term; however, weight is generally regained on discontinuation of treatment. Behaviour modification programmes appear to offer the highest success rate in the long term. Weight loss is not rapid, although losses of 10 to 15 kg have been achieved after 6 months, and this may be increased when behaviour modification therapy is combined with more aggressive treatments such as severe caloric restriction or jaw wiring. Behaviour modification is particularly beneficial in special patient groups such as the obese elderly, children or adolescents, and disabled patients. Thus, although it appears that each of the treatments developed for the management of obese patients has its place, the cornerstone of therapy for most patients remains a programme of dietary restriction, combined with exercise and behaviour modification.","['Caterson, I D']",['Caterson ID'],"['Department of Endocrinology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,,IM,"['Behavior Therapy', 'Eating', 'Exercise', 'Humans', 'Obesity/diet therapy/drug therapy/*therapy']",,,,,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003495-199000393-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 1990;39 Suppl 3:20-32. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199000393-00004.,,,,,,,123,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients who know they are obese may better control their weight or seek medical attention. Self-recognition may be affected by race/ethnicity, but little is known about racial/ethnic differences in knowledge of obesity's health risks. OBJECTIVE: To examine awareness of obesity and attendant health risks among US whites, Hispanics and African-Americans. DESIGN: Cross-sectional self-administered survey. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients at three general medical clinics and one cardiology clinic. MAIN MEASURES: Thirty-one questions regarding demographics, height and weight, and perceptions and attitudes regarding obesity and associated health risks. Multiple logistic regression was used to quantify the association between ethnicity and obesity awareness, controlling for socio-demographic confounders. KEY RESULTS: Of 1,090 patients who were offered the survey, 1,031 completed it (response rate 95%); a final sample size of 970 was obtained after exclusion for implausible BMI, mixed or Asian ethnicity. Mean age was 47 years; 64% were female, 39% were white, 39% Hispanic and 22% African-American; 48% were obese (BMI >/=30 kg/m(2)). Among obese subjects, whites were more likely to self-report obesity than minorities (adjusted proportions: 95% of whites vs. 84% of African-American and 86% of Hispanics, P = 0.006). Ethnic differences in obesity recognition disappeared when BMI was >35 kg/m(2). African-Americans were significantly less likely than whites or Hispanics to view obesity as a health problem (77% vs. 90% vs. 88%, p < 0.001); African-Americans and Hispanics were less likely than whites to recognize the link between obesity and hypertension, diabetes and heart disease. Of self-identified obese patients, 99% wanted to lose weight, but only 60% received weight loss advice from their health care provider. CONCLUSIONS: African-Americans and Hispanics are significantly less likely to self report obesity and associated health risks.

Aim: This study assesses childhood trauma history and dissociative symptoms in obese patients with BED compared to obese patients without BED. Methods: The 241 patients participating in the study had to meet obesity criteria. These patients were applicants for bariatric surgery and were consulted by a psychiatry service. Patients were separated into two groups that were accompanied by BED diagnoses according to structured clinical interviews administered according to the DSM-IV (SCID-I). Patients were assessed using the Dissociation Questionnaire (DIS-Q) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). The two groups of patients were compared. Results: A total of 75 (31.1%) of the 241 obese patients were diagnosed with BED. The study showed that obese patients with BED had higher dissociative scores than those without BED (p < .05). The results showed higher total scores and two different types of childhood trauma (physical abuse and emotional abuse) in BED patients compared to non-BED patients (p < .05). Conclusions: Clinicians should be fully aware of BED, dissociative symptoms and childhood traumatic experiences. These results show that, for at least a sub-group of obese patients, BED is associated with obesity and may be connected with dissociative symptoms and childhood physical abuse and emotional abuse.","['Belli, Hasan', 'Ural, Cenk', 'Akbudak, Mahir', 'Sagaltici, Eser']","['Belli H', 'Ural C', 'Akbudak M', 'Sagaltici E']","['Department of Psychiatry, Bagcilar Education and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Bagcilar Education and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Mardin State Hospital , Mardin , Turkey.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Bagcilar Education and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences , Istanbul , Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Nord J Psychiatry,Nordic journal of psychiatry,100927567,,IM,"['Adult', 'Binge-Eating Disorder/diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Child', 'Child Abuse/*psychology/*trends', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dissociative Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology', 'Obesity, Morbid/diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Obesity', 'binge eating disorder', 'childhood trauma', 'dissociation']",,2019/09/11 06:00,2019/12/25 06:00,['2019/09/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08039488.2019.1662085 [doi]'],ppublish,Nord J Psychiatry. 2019 Nov;73(8):527-531. doi: 10.1080/08039488.2019.1662085.

The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between linear body measurements (anthropometry) and weight in severely obese people in order to generate equations to predict such measurements from weight alone. Various body size measurements were obtained from three independent data sets (74 severely obese individuals evaluated at the New York Obesity Research Center, 103 severely obese individuals who participated in the National Center for Health Statistics' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, and a further 90 severely obese individuals evaluated at the New York Obesity Research Center). Linear regression analyses revealed that for each increase of 10 kg (22.04 lb) above 136 kg (300 lb), body diameter measurements increase by 0.9-1.1 cm.

Various social factors have been identified as influencing investment in preventive health practices such as physical activity. Weight stigmatization is now considered to be one of them. In order to contribute to a better understanding of the factors related to the investment of obese women in physical activity, this narrative review will focus on the stigmatization of obesity as a potential factor compromising their investment in regular physical activity and threatening their health.

Anesthesia was induced by remifentanil bolus, followed by propofol and cisatracurium to facilitate oro-tracheal intubation and was maintained by balanced anesthesia of remifentanil intravenous infusion and sevoflurane in oxygen and air. Time from discontinuation of maintenance anesthesia to fully awake were recorded at 1-min intervals and time from discontinuation of anesthesia until patient was transferred to post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and discharged from PACU was also recorded. Pulmonary function tests were performed before surgery and repeated 4 h, days 1, 2 and 3 post-operative for evaluation of forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s and peak expiratory flow rate. Occurrence of post-operative complications, re-admission to ICU, hospital stay and morbidities were also recorded. Induction of anesthesia using remifentanil bolus injection resulted in significant decrease of heart rate and arterial pressures compared to pre-operative and pre-induction values. Recovery times were significantly shorter in obese compared to morbidly obese women. Post-operative pulmonary function tests showed significant deterioration compared to pre-operative measures but showed progressive improvement through first 3 post-operative days. Hospital stay was significantly shorter for obese compared to morbid obese women. Obesity delays recovery from general anesthesia, adversely affects pulmonary functions and increases post-operative complications.

Impairment of energy intake or of energy expenditure].,87-92,,"Obesity may result from two mechanisms: a chronic excess of energy intake and/or a reduced energy expenditure. Most studies failed to show a correlation between food intake and body weight; however, no efficient mechanism to spare energy has been demonstrated in obese subjects. Although an impaired thermic effect of food has been reported in obese subjects, this effect does not result in a substantial economy of energy. Total energy expenditure in humans is positively correlated with body size. This demonstrates that energy requirements of obese subjects is larger than those of lean sedentary individuals. The reason for these discrepant observations is the under-reporting of food intake by obese subjects. Obesity is therefore mainly due to a chronic excess of energy intake. Investigations on nutrient balances have shown interesting mechanisms which are relevant for the development of obesity. Carbohydrate balance is accurately regulated: ingested carbohydrates over 24 hours are mainly oxidized during this period of time. The other metabolic pathways of carbohydrates, such as de novo lipogenesis or synthesis of non essential amino acids, are of minor importance. Another property of carbohydrates is to elicit a greater satiating effect than lipids. Protein balance is also accurately regulated; the daily protein ingestion is matched by a similar amount of protein oxidation. In addition, protein ingestion has the greatest satiating effect among the three macronutrients. By contrast, lipid balance is not regulated because lipid oxidation.

Reports, policies and interventions have emphasized that it is the responsibility of individual consumers to make personal changes to reduce obesity. The Foresight Report 'Tackling Obesities: Future Choices' (2007) attempted to reframe obesity as a complex problem that required multiple sites of intervention well beyond the range of personal responsibility. This framing formed the basis for policy and coincided with increasing acknowledgement of the complex nature of obesity in obesity research. Yet policy and interventions developed following Foresight, such as the Change4Life social marketing campaign, targeted individual consumer behaviour. With the Conservative-Liberal Democrat government of 2011, intervention shifted to corporate and individual responsibility, making corporations voluntarily responsible for motivating individual consumers to change. This article examines shifts in the framing of obesity from a problem of individual responsibility, towards collective responsibility, and back to the individual in UK government reports, policies and interventions between 1997 and 2015. We show that UK obesity policies reflect the landscape of policymakers, advisors, political pressures and values, as much as, if not more than, the landscape of evidence. The view that the individual should be the central site for obesity prevention and intervention has remained central to the political framing of population-level obesity, despite strong evidence contrary to this. Power dynamics in obesity governance processes have remained unchallenged by the UK government, and individualistic framing of obesity policy continues to offer the path of least resistance.","['Ulijaszek, Stanley J', 'McLennan, Amy K']","['Ulijaszek SJ', 'McLennan AK']","['School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Obes Rev,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,100897395,,IM,"['Health Policy', 'Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Individuation', 'Obesity/*prevention & control', '*Socioeconomic Factors', 'United Kingdom']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Consumption', 'UK', 'individualism', 'obesity policy']",,2016/04/10 06:00,2017/06/14 06:00,['2016/04/10 06:00'],"['2015/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/obr.12386 [doi]'],ppublish,Obes Rev. 2016 May;17(5):397-411. doi: 10.1111/obr.12386.,,,,['(c) 2016 World Obesity.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prevalence of obesity among women with mental retardation is 18-30% greater than that among women without mental retardation. In the Nachman Village, a governmental institution for adults with mental retardation, the main nutritional difficulties result from residents eating snacks in addition to their balanced meals. Psychological complexity and the ambivalent attitude of families, caregivers and residents prevented the achievement of balanced diets and healthy body weights. The women's house mother took upon herself to detect residents with nutritional problems and started an intervention program aiming at promoting a healthy lifestyle and maintenance of normal body weight. METHODS: The program 'House Queen' was Launched on a voluntary basis. The staff encouraged the residents to engage in physical activity, restrict snack consumption and amounts of food at meals, eat vegetables and not waste pocket money on non-nutritional foods. Each month one or two residents who lost weight while maintaining a healthy lifestyle received a prize and the title ""House Queen"". The statistical analysis included 22 residents and was conducted retrospectively from data coLlected during a routine medical follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 59.1% of the residents were morbidly obese and 27.3% were obese at the beginning of the program. Seventeen months later, they weighed an average of 8 kg Less, and only 36.4% and 18.2% of them were morbidly obese and obese, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggest a correlation between the 'House Queen' program and Lowering body weight, which encourage the authors to broaden the program to other residents in the Village and combine supportive and restrictive attitudes towards a healthy lifestyle for mentally disabled people.","['Bardugo, Esther', 'Moses, Lilach', 'Shemmer, Martha', 'Dubman, Innesa']","['Bardugo E', 'Moses L', 'Shemmer M', 'Dubman I']",['Nachman Village Infirmary.'],['heb'],['Journal Article'],Israel,Harefuah,Harefuah,0034351,,IM,"['Adult', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/*complications', '*Life Style', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Obesity/epidemiology/etiology/*therapy', 'Obesity, Morbid/epidemiology/etiology/*therapy', 'Residential Facilities', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reward']",,,,,2011/05/17 06:00,2011/06/08 06:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,"Harefuah. 2010 Oct;149(10):645-9, 684 , 683.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By acting as a satiety factor and increasing energy expenditure, leptin plays a major role in body weight homeostasis in mice. Ob gene and leptin production by the adipose cells are under the control of various hormonal and metabolic factors. Ob mRNA levels are markedly reduced by fasting and restored to normal by refeeding. High-fat feeding increases ob gene and plasma leptin, and induces a state of resistance to leptin. Two hormones, insulin and corticosterone, increase leptin production in rodent and human adipose cells. In contrast, the activity of the sympathetic nervous system exerts an opposite effect, mainly through activation of the adipose beta 3-adrenergic receptors. Leptin synthesis is also decreased by thiazolidinediones, a new class of antidiabetic drugs. The obese Zucker fa/fa rats bear a mutation in the leptin receptor gene (OB-R) and are leptin resistant. In these rats, ob mRNA levels are increased early in life and are not reduced by fasting. This suggests that functional OB-Rs are required for the generation of the signal(s) that downregulates ob gene expression in the adipose cell. The extent to which this is relevant to human obesities, which are characterized by increased leptin levels, remains to be determined.","['Guerre-Millo, M']",['Guerre-Millo M'],"['U 465 INSERM, Institut Biomedical des Cordeliers, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leptin', 'Mice', 'Mice, Obese', 'Obesity/*genetics', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Zucker', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Leptin']",,,,,1997/01/01 00:00,1998/01/22 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/22 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0753-3322(97)88048-1 [pii]', '10.1016/S0753-3322(97)88048-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 1997;51(8):318-23. doi: 10.1016/S0753-3322(97)88048-1.,,,,,,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is theorized that increased impulsivity at least partly underlies the inability to control eating behaviour; being more impulsive is supposed to make it more difficult to resist food intake. Thirty-three obese children in a residential setting and 31 lean control children are tested. Impulsivity is measured with two behavioural measures (inhibitory control and sensitivity to reward) and questionnaires. Results show that the obese children in treatment were more sensitive to reward and showed less inhibitory control than normal weight children. In addition, the obese children with eating binges were more impulsive than the obese children without eating binges. Most interesting finding was that the children that were the least effective in inhibiting responses, lost less weight in the residential treatment program. To conclude: impulsivity is a personality characteristic that potentially has crucial consequences for the development and maintenance, as well as treatment of obesity.","['Nederkoorn, Chantal', 'Braet, Caroline', 'Van Eijs, Yvonne', 'Tanghe, Ann', 'Jansen, Anita']","['Nederkoorn C', 'Braet C', 'Van Eijs Y', 'Tanghe A', 'Jansen A']","['Department of Experimental Psychology, Maastricht University, The Netherlands. c.nederkoorn@psychology.unimaas.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Eat Behav,Eating behaviors,101090048,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Attitude', 'Child', '*Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Impulsive Behavior/*epidemiology/*psychology', 'Inhibition, Psychological', 'Male', 'Obesity/*epidemiology/*psychology/therapy', 'Patient Care Team', 'Residential Treatment', 'Reward', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,,,2006/10/24 09:00,2007/02/07 09:00,['2006/10/24 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/27 00:00 [revised]', '2005/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1471-0153(05)00075-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.eatbeh.2005.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Eat Behav. 2006 Nov;7(4):315-22. doi: 10.1016/j.eatbeh.2005.11.005.

However, over the course of obesity progression, the AT undergo continual remodeling, evolving into pathological alterations. It is now clear that pro-inflammatory cell accumulation favors local AT injury. More recently, we and others described excess levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) and fibrosis in AT depots from obese individuals. In obese mice, targeting ECM-remodeling improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Therefore AT fibrosis represents a maladaptive mechanism contributing to obesity-related metabolic complications such as diabetes, cardiometabolic and liver diseases.

The thermogenic response to the mixed meal (a liquid diet containing 17, 54, and 29% as protein, carbohydrate, and lipid calories, respectively, and an energy level determined to cover 60% of the basal energy expenditure computed for 24 h) was found to be significantly reduced in the obese as compared to controls (ie, 7.6 +/- 0.4% versus 9.5 +/- 0.4% of the energy content of the load, respectively, p less than 0.025). After weight loss, the postprandial thermogenesis of the obese was still markedly reduced (ie, 6.2 +/- 0.8%). Both before and after weight loss, the relative increase in diurnal urinary norepinephrine excretion was found to be lower in the obese than in controls, when compared to the nocturnal values. These results show that the greater 24 h energy expenditure of obese women is entirely due to their higher basal metabolic rate. The lower thermogenic response to the meal in the obese supports the concept of a thermogenic defect which can favor energy gain; furthermore, the unchanged response after weight loss in the obese suggests that the thermogenic defect may be a cause rather than a consequence of obesity.","['Bessard, T', 'Schutz, Y', 'Jequier, E']","['Bessard T', 'Schutz Y', 'Jequier E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Clin Nutr,The American journal of clinical nutrition,0376027,,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Basal Metabolism', 'Body Composition', '*Body Temperature Regulation', 'Calorimetry, Indirect', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Obesity/diet therapy/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Respiration']",,,,,1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcn/38.5.680 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Nutr. 1983 Nov;38(5):680-93. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/38.5.680.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review will focus on the progress in our understanding of the disease that CRC-based research has produced; therefore, the reference list is not exhaustive and consists primarily of CRC-based research. Obesity is defined as an excess of body fat as measured by triceps skinfold thickness. The time of onset of obesity is an important factor; for example, early onset is associated with an increase in the number of fat cells. Weight loss reduces the size but not the number of fat cells. Type II diabetes mellitus is a common complication in obese adults; this condition has been related to fat cell size and, in women, to predominantly upper-body fat distribution. Pregnant obese women and their babies are at risk for a number of problems. Abnormalities commonly found in obese persons include increased plasma lipid levels, hyperinsulinism, increased cholesterol synthesis, high frequency of gallstones, and hypertension. Under a variety of experimental conditions, the only difference in the response of obese and normal weight subjects to food was that the obese subjects appeared to consume more, but other data suggest that the obese may have greater energy needs. Carbohydrate intake has been studied extensively. Metabolic rate increases with over-feeding, especially in response to carbohydrate. Basal metabolic rates are higher in obese adults and rise in response to overfeeding; they decrease after weight reduction. This decrease can be counteracted with sucrose, perhaps because sucrose maintains triiodothyronine levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Dietz, W H']",['Dietz WH'],"['New England Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Am Coll Nutr,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,8215879,,IM,"['Energy Metabolism', 'Humans', '*Obesity/metabolism/pathology', 'Research', 'Weight Loss']",,,,,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07315724.1989.10737966 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Coll Nutr. 1989;8 Suppl:13S-21S. doi: 10.1080/07315724.1989.10737966.,,,,,,,94,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The global prevalence of overweight and obesity among children shows an increasing tendency. Many of overweight or obese children will become obese adults with enhanced risk for cardiovascular diseases. Childhood obesity is often accompanied by serious consequences such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, pro-inflammatory state and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Hypertension, high LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, insulin resistance, inflammation and disturbances in adipocytokines secretion are associated with endothelial dysfunction which precedes the development of atherosclerosis. Obese children and adolescents with a clinically-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is currently recognized as the hepatic component of metabolic syndrome, are at more severe cardiovascular risk compared with normal-weight. Obesity-related insulin resistance is highly prevalent in children and adolescents, and is associated with the increased lifetime risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adipokines contribute to obesity-atherosclerosis relationships yet among several recently discovered adipokines only few (adiponectin, resistin, chemerin, fibroblast growth factor 21, apelin) have been partly studied in obese pediatric population.

Analysis concluded that our sample, both overweight and normal subjects, share the negative stereotypic attitudes towards obese persons. However, there was a considerable difference in emotional evaluation of eating behaviour. If normal subjects attribute a strong negative emotional connotation, obese subjects not only did not recognise the ""abnormality"" of overeating, but preferred it. This can be explained by the presence of an association of strength and power with overeating: at the moment of eating, obese subjects feel themselves ""strong"" and even ""superior,"" thereby compensating for their rather weak and fragile personalities. The emotional evaluation of eating behavior did not change after a 10-week dietary/behavioural treatment.","['Riva, G']",['Riva G'],"['Catholic University of Milan, Italy. auxo.psylab@gse.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Psychol Rep,Psychological reports,0376475,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', '*Affect', 'Body Mass Index', 'Diet Therapy', '*Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*psychology/*therapy']",,,,,1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Psychol Rep. 1996 Aug;79(1):35-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weight loss is associated with improvements in obesity-related health complications, but patients and practitioners are frequently disappointed by the long-term results of weight control efforts. Recent research has yielded new findings concerning the causes of obesity, as well as new goals for obesity treatment. Traditionally, the goal of therapy has been reduction to ideal weight. Several scientific bodies, however, now recommend a more modest 5% to 15% reduction in initial weight. Current options for weight loss include behavioral or pharmacological management provided during primary care visits, self-help and commercial programs, hospital-based interventions, and bariatric surgery.

The case for medical treatment.,1-4,,"We should ask about any therapy: (1) is it safe? and (2) is it effective? The best therapy is that which has the greatest chance to do good with the least chance to cause harm. Medical treatment is certainly safer than surgery, since (by my definition) surgery always involves a general anaesthetic, and morbidly obese patients are bad anaesthetic risks. Obesity also increases other surgical risks, so all published series of surgically-treated obese patients report some mortality. Surgeons will claim that surgery is much more effective than medical treatment, which has negligible success in morbid obesity. However all surgical bypass or banding procedures cause weight loss by restricting food intake, so if food intake can be equally restricted without surgery the results are just as good. In our experience jaw-wiring (which does not require a general anaesthetic) produces similar weight loss to gastroplasty. However the most difficult problem in morbid obesity is the maintenance of reduced weight many years after treatment. We have too few good long-term follow-up data after either medical or surgical treatment, but about half our patients treated with jaw-wiring and a waist cord maintain their weight loss on 3 years follow-up, zero mortality from the procedure. The results of surgical and medical treatments depend on the skill and care with which they are applied, and the way in which patients are selected. If patients are given treatment B if they are considered unsuitable for treatment A then the results from treatment A will be better.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Garrow, J S']",['Garrow JS'],"['Nutrition Research Group, Clinical Research Centre, Harrow, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Obes,International journal of obesity,7703240,,IM,"['Adult', 'Body Weight', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/metabolism/surgery/*therapy']",,,,,1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Obes. 1987;11 Suppl 3:1-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we evaluated the role of microRNAs and their target genes that are involved in heart collagen deposition and calcium signaling, as well as the cardiac remodeling induced by AET in obese Zucker rats. Among the four experimental Zucker groups: control lean rats (LZR), control obese rats (OZR), trained lean rats (LZR + TR), and trained obese rats (OZR + TR), heart weight was greater in the OZR than in the LZR group due to increased cardiac intramuscular fat and collagen. AET seems to exert a protective role in normalizing the heart weight in the OZR + TR group. Cardiac microRNA-29c expression was decreased in OZR compared with the LZR group, paralleled by an increase in the collagen volumetric fraction (CVF). MicroRNA-1 expression was upregulated while the expression of its target gene NCX1 was decreased in OZR compared with the LZR group. Interestingly, AET restored cardiac microRNA-1 to nonpathological levels in the OZR-TR group. Our findings suggest that AET could be used as a nonpharmacological therapy for the reversal of pathological cardiac remodeling and cardiac dysfunction in obesity.","['Silveira, Andre C', 'Fernandes, Tiago', 'Soci, Ursula P R', 'Gomes, Joao L P', 'Barretti, Diego L', 'Mota, Gloria G F', 'Negrao, Carlos Eduardo', 'Oliveira, Edilamar M']","['Silveira AC', 'Fernandes T', 'Soci UPR', 'Gomes JLP', 'Barretti DL', 'Mota GGF', 'Negrao CE', 'Oliveira EM']","['Laboratory of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Exercise, School of Physical Education and Sport, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Exercise, School of Physical Education and Sport, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Exercise, School of Physical Education and Sport, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Exercise, School of Physical Education and Sport, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Exercise, School of Physical Education and Sport, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Exercise, School of Physical Education and Sport, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Exercise, School of Physical Education and Sport, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Heart Institute (InCor), Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Exercise, School of Physical Education and Sport, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,"['0 (MIRN1 microRNA, rat)', '0 (MIRN29 microRNA, rat)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Heart/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Obesity/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Physical Conditioning, Animal/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Zucker']",PMC5613694,,,,2017/11/16 06:00,2018/07/20 06:00,['2017/11/16 06:00'],"['2017/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/1549014 [doi]'],ppublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2017;2017:1549014. doi: 10.1155/2017/1549014.

It is important to note that obesity disrupts all systems, generating metabolic consequences that may be irreversible. Interdisciplinary therapy is recommended as the primary method for treating obesity. However, the cost of interdisciplinary treatment can be high due to the need for various professionals, from different areas of expertise. This study compares the effects of 32 weeks of physical training combined with interdisciplinary therapy on anthropometric and biochemical parameters in obese women. METHODS: Seventy-six subjects were randomized into two groups: Group Physical Exercise (EXE) and Group Interdisciplinary Treatment (INTER), being evaluated in the initial moment and after 32 weeks. 30 subjects completed the intervention and were evaluated (EXE: N.=13; INTER: N.=17). RESULTS: Psychobiological and biochemical variables were measured. EXE and INTER were similar before treatment and both showed significantly improvements in anthropometric and biochemical parameters after interventions, without difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed the relevant role of physical training or the interdisciplinary therapy on metabolic profile of obese women. We realized that physical training can be incorporated into public or private health systems as an alternative strategy for obesity control, especially in locations that do not have the possibility of offering a complete interdisciplinary therapy.","['Cerrone, Leticia A', 'Caranti, Danielle A', 'Fidalgo, Joao P', 'Sanches, Ricardo B', 'Nascimento, Maythe A', 'Astride, Renata R', 'Poli, Vanessa F', 'de Campos, Carlos E', 'Oyama, Lila M', 'Yi, Liu C', 'Damaso, Ana R', 'Teixeira, Caue V', 'Gomes, Ricardo J']","['Cerrone LA', 'Caranti DA', 'Fidalgo JP', 'Sanches RB', 'Nascimento MA', 'Astride RR', 'Poli VF', 'de Campos CE', 'Oyama LM', 'Yi LC', 'Damaso AR', 'Teixeira CV', 'Gomes RJ']","['Obesity Study Group, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Santos, SP, Brazil - leticia.ac9@gmail.com.', 'Obesity Study Group, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Santos, SP, Brazil.', 'Obesity Study Group, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Santos, SP, Brazil.', 'Obesity Study Group, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Santos, SP, Brazil.', 'State University of Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Obesity Study Group, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Santos, SP, Brazil.', 'Obesity Study Group, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Santos, SP, Brazil.', 'Obesity Study Group, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Santos, SP, Brazil.', 'Cellula Mater Laboratory, Santos, SP, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Obesity Study Group, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Santos, SP, Brazil.', 'Obesity Study Group, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Santos, SP, Brazil.', 'Obesity Study Group, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Santos, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Italy,J Sports Med Phys Fitness,The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,0376337,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anthropometry', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Exercise', '*Exercise Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/blood/psychology/*therapy', '*Physical Therapy Modalities']",,,,,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-4707.20.10036-7 [pii]', '10.23736/S0022-4707.20.10036-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 2020 Jun;60(6):903-911. doi: 10.23736/S0022-4707.20.10036-7.

RECENT FINDINGS: Gut microbiota dysbiosis is a frequent characteristic observed in obesity and related metabolic diseases. Pieces of evidence mostly generated in mouse models suggest that rescuing this dysbiosis associates with improved metabolism. In humans, dietary or bariatric surgery interventions are often accompanied by complete or partial restoration of this dysbiosis together with weight reduction and metabolic amelioration. FMT is an interesting option to modify gut microbiota and has been associated with improved clinical outcomes, albeit only used in routine care for Clostridium difficile infection. However, there are only limited data on using FMT in the metabolic context. FMT from lean donors significantly improves insulin sensitivity in obese subjects with metabolic syndrome. However, there is a wide range of clinical responses. Interestingly in subjects with high microbial gene richness at baseline and when FMT donors that are metabolically compromised are used, no metabolic improvement is seen. Moreover, more studies evaluating the effect of FMT in patients with overt type 2 diabetes are warranted. Furthermore, interventions (in the receiver prior to FMT) aiming to enhance FMT response also need evaluation.","['Aron-Wisnewsky, Judith', 'Clement, Karine', 'Nieuwdorp, Max']","['Aron-Wisnewsky J', 'Clement K', 'Nieuwdorp M']","['Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and Obesities: Systemic Approaches (NutriOMics) Research Unit, Paris, France. judith.aron-wisnewsky@psl.aphp.fr.', 'Assistante Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Nutrition Department, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, 75013, Paris, France. judith.aron-wisnewsky@psl.aphp.fr.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Location AMC and VUMC, Department of Internal and Vascular Medicine, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. judith.aron-wisnewsky@psl.aphp.fr.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and Obesities: Systemic Approaches (NutriOMics) Research Unit, Paris, France.', 'Assistante Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Nutrition Department, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, 75013, Paris, France.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Location AMC and VUMC, Department of Internal and Vascular Medicine, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Diab Rep,Current diabetes reports,101093791,,IM,"['Animals', '*Clostridium Infections', '*Diabetes Mellitus', '*Fecal Microbiota Transplantation', 'Feces', 'Humans', 'Obesity', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Encapsulated feces', 'Fecal microbiota transplantation', 'Microbiota', 'Obesity', 'Type 2 diabetes']",,2019/06/30 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,['2019/06/29 06:00'],"['2019/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11892-019-1180-z [pii]', '10.1007/s11892-019-1180-z [doi]']",epublish,Curr Diab Rep. 2019 Jun 27;19(8):51. doi: 10.1007/s11892-019-1180-z.,,20190627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies about the effects of a possible interaction between gender and body mass are rare. The objective of the present paper is to estimate the biological interaction between gender and obesity on HRQL. This was a cross-sectional study based on data from CAMELIA study with population assisted by the Family Doctor Program of Niteroi visited between June 2006 and December 2007. HRQL was assessed by the SF-36. The exposure categories were: obese women, non-obese women, obese men and non-obese men, the reference category. Obese women showed higher percentages of low overall, physical and mental quality of life with the largest associations in the physical component. The excess risk due to interaction was statistically significant in physical dimension: RERI = 1.97 (0.40-3.52) and RERIa = 1,97 (0.40-1.7). Among the Brazilian population aged 20-64 years, obesity was independently associated with low HRQL. This association differed by gender, being significant for women. The possibility of the combined effect takes greater importance in the context of increasing incidence of obesity globally. Healthcare professionals in primary care settings should pay attention to gender differences in the impact of obesity on HRQL.","['Torres, Karla Dala Paula', 'Rosa, Maria Luiza Garcia', 'Moscavitch, Samuel Datum']","['Torres KD', 'Rosa ML', 'Moscavitch SD']","['Departamento de Epidemiologia e Bioestatistica, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niteroi, RJ, Brasil, karladptorres@gmail.com.', 'Departamento de Epidemiologia e Bioestatistica, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niteroi, RJ, Brasil, karladptorres@gmail.com.', 'Departamento de Epidemiologia e Bioestatistica, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niteroi, RJ, Brasil, karladptorres@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Cien Saude Colet,Ciencia & saude coletiva,9713483,,IM,"['Adult', 'Brazil', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'F Factor', 'Family Practice', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*epidemiology/physiopathology/psychology', 'Primary Health Care/*organization & administration', '*Quality of Life', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2016/05/12 06:00,2018/02/02 06:00,['2016/05/12 06:00'],"['2015/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S1413-81232016000501617 [pii]', '10.1590/1413-81232015215.10832015 [doi]']",ppublish,Cien Saude Colet. 2016 May;21(5):1617-24. doi: 10.1590/1413-81232015215.10832015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problem of the low triiodothyronine (T3) syndrome was treated in chapter 2. The decrease of serum T3 and increase of serum reverse T3 in obese subjects was induced by several factors, namely by fasting. A resistance to administered thyroxine and triiodothyronine was observed in these patients. This energy saving mechanism is at variance with slimming regimens. The prevention and treatment of this awkward complication was discussed. The next chapter (3) is concerned with the hormonal and metabolic effects of diet and motor activity in the course of slimming regimens. The different effects of diet and motor activity on epinephrine and norepinephrine in obese subjects were similar to those obtained by other investigators in nonobese humans. A great importance was attributed to an increased plasma level of cortisol in obese and nonobese subjects in the course of different forms of motor activity and related to a different intensity of exercise. Parallel to several of these experiments, beta-endorphin, thyroid hormones and glucagon were also estimated. It was suggested that motor activity for exercising subjects should not lead to an enhanced secretion of cortisol in view of the health deteriorating effects of increased cortisolemia and in view of an already stimulated secretion of this hormone in obese subjects on basal conditions. Vice versa, a decreased cortisolemia should be obtained in obese subjects treated with an appropriate motor activity and diet. It has been shown that diet without motor activity reduced the level of plasma androgens but in cooperation with motor activity, the level of androgens remained unaltered in the course of the reducing regimen. The conservation of a normal or even higher level of androgens is probably prerequisite for a positive nitrogen balance observed in the course of a combined slimming regimen, while diet without motor activity led in the studied conditions to a negative nitrogen balance. Chapter 4 was devoted to the role of motor activity in slimming regimens. In view of the metabolic effects of motor activity and the clinical late effects of obesity (osteoarthritis of the knees, hips and spine, arterial hypertension, overload of the cardiovascular system, diabetes mellitus etc.), a selection of motor activities was proposed. According to our long experience, we do not recommend jogging, running, jumping and all sports leading to collisions of players.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Sonka, J']",['Sonka J'],"['Laboratory for Endocrinology and Metabolism, Charles University Medical Faculty.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Czech Republic,Acta Univ Carol Med Monogr,Acta Universitatis Carolinae.

Obesity is a complex process involving genetic and environmental factors with an epidemiological burden that makes it a major public health issue. Studies of germ-free or gnotobiotic mice provided evidence that the diversity, as well as the presence and relative proportion of different microbes in the gut play active roles in energy homeostasis. Similarly, human studies showed that both the diversity of the microbiota and the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio are decreased in obese individuals. The 'obese microbiota' seems to be able to increase dietary energy harvest and favor weight gain and fat deposition. Although research in this field has just started and many of the available data are still conflicting, the results are providing exciting perspectives, and gut microbiota manipulation has already become a new target for both prevention and treatment of obesity.","['Compare, Debora', 'Rocco, Alba', 'Sanduzzi Zamparelli, Marco', 'Nardone, Gerardo']","['Compare D', 'Rocco A', 'Sanduzzi Zamparelli M', 'Nardone G']","['Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Hepatogastroenterology Unit, University Federico II, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Dig Dis,"Digestive diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",8701186,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bacteria/*metabolism', 'Diet', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Health', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*microbiology/*pathology/therapy']",,,,,2016/03/31 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/03/31 06:00'],"['2016/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['000443356 [pii]', '10.1159/000443356 [doi]']",ppublish,Dig Dis. 2016;34(3):221-9. doi: 10.1159/000443356.

In this paper, I forward a complementary explanation; this pathophysiology arises not from adiposity alone, but also from the psychological stress induced by the social stigma associated with being obese. METHODS: In this study, I pursue novel lines of evidence to explore the possibility that obesity-associated stigma produces obesity-associated medical conditions. I also entertain alternative hypotheses that might explain the observed relationships. RESULTS: I forward four lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that psychological stress plays a role in the adiposity-health association. First, body mass index (BMI) is a strong predictor of serological biomarkers of stress. Second, obesity and stress are linked to the same diseases. Third, body norms appear to be strong determinants of morbidity and mortality among obese persons; obese whites and women - the two groups most affected by weight-related stigma in surveys - disproportionately suffer from excess mortality. Finally, statistical models suggest that the desire to lose weight is an important driver of weight-related morbidity when BMI is held constant. CONCLUSION: Obese persons experience a high degree of stress, and this stress plausibly explains a portion of the BMI-health association. Thus, the obesity epidemic may, in part, be driven by social constructs surrounding body image norms.","['Muennig, Peter']",['Muennig P'],"['Department of Health Policy and Management, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, USA. pm124@columbia.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Public Health,BMC public health,100968562,,IM,"['Adiposity', 'Age Factors', 'Body Mass Index', 'Electric Impedance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/complications/ethnology/mortality/*psychology', '*Prejudice', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Stress, Psychological/*complications']",PMC2386473,,,,2008/04/23 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/04/23 09:00'],"['2007/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2458-8-128 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2458-8-128 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Public Health. 2008 Apr 21;8:128. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-8-128.,,20080421,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: All participants reported having failed physicians' attempts to aid them in weight loss. Similarly, all related negative life experiences, job discrimination, and derogatory remarks that they attributed to their weight. Participants were not supportive of physicians' traditional approach to aiding patients with weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the traditional approach to treating patients' excessive weight is not helpful from the patient viewpoint. Study participants were more supportive of a group approach to the treatment of obesity that would include group exercise and modification of currently used foods rather than new low-calorie recipes. The issues of transportation and child care must be addressed by weight-loss programs.","['Murphree, D']",['Murphree D'],"['Department of Community Health and Family Medicine, University of Florida Health Science Center-Jacksonville 32208.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Fam Pract,The Journal of family practice,7502590,,IM,"['Adult', '*Attitude to Health', 'Diet, Reducing', 'Exercise Therapy', '*Family Practice', 'Focus Groups', 'Humans', 'Obesity/diet therapy/*psychology/*therapy', 'Psychotherapy, Group']",,,,,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Fam Pract. 1994 Jan;38(1):45-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: COI1-4 values calculated as a ratio of android to gynoid tissue mass, fat mass and their % were determined in 4 groups, each consisting of 18 women: 1st group of CS, 2nd group of obese women (O1) not different according to their age and BMI from CS, 3rd group of obese women (O2) with BMI of 35 +/- 1.2 kg and 4th group of non obese healthy women (C) with normal BMI. Diagnostic accuracy (DG) of CP values of COI1m-4m indexes of abdominal obesity and CP values of COI1n-4n indexes of normal body fat distribution (BFD) was determined. RESULTS: COI1-4 indexes values were highly significantly different among the 4 examined groups and were significantly highest in CS patients and lowest in group C (p < 0.0001). COI1m-4m CP values differentiated extreme visceral, abdominal obesity in CS with highest DG as well as COI1n-4n CP values differentiated normal BFD in group C. COI1m CP of 0.55 best differentiated CS from O1 for DG of 100%. COI2n of 0.38 best differentiated C from CS and O2 for highest DG of 100% compared to O1 because of the significantly higher BMI and COI1n-4n values in O2 that were associated with more pronounced abdominal obesity and highly significantly positive correlation with BMI. CONCLUSIONS: DXA cut-off point values of indexes COI1m-4m and COI1n-4n were established as diagnostic indexes and criteria useful in discovering extreme abdominal and normal BFD. COI1m CP value of 0.55 was discovered as a diagnostic criterion of extreme abdominal obesity and COI2n of 0.38 as a diagnostic criterion of normal BFD that excluded abdominal obesity. The other indexes COI1m-4m and COI1n-4n CP values had also high DG in discovering abdominal and normal body fat distribution.","['Stratrova, Slavica Shubeska', 'Mishevska, Sasha Jovanovska', 'Bitoska, Iskra', 'Kafedziska, Irena']","['Stratrova SS', 'Mishevska SJ', 'Bitoska I', 'Kafedziska I']","['University Clinic of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, Faculty of Medicine, University Ss Cyril and Methodius, Skopje, R.

In the present study, we explored the effect of weight loading on metabolic outcomes, meal patterns and parameters linked to energy expenditure in both obese and lean rats. Diet-induced obese (DIO) and lean rats were implanted with capsules weighing either 15% of biological body weight (load) or empty capsules (1.3% of body weight; controls). Loading protected against fat accumulation more markedly in the DIO group. In line with this, the obesity-related impairment in insulin sensitivity was notably ameliorated in DIO rats upon loading, as revealed by the reduction in serum insulin levels and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance index scores. Although 24-hour caloric intake was reduced in both groups, this effect was greater in loaded DIO rats than in loaded lean peers. During days 10-16, after recovery from surgery, loading: (i) decreased meal size in both groups (only during the light phase in DIO rats) but this was compensated in lean rats by an increase in meal frequency; (ii) reduced dark phase locomotor activity only in lean rats; and (iii) reduced mean caloric efficiency in DIO rats. Muscle weight was unaffected by loading in either group. Dietary-obese rats are therefore more responsive than lean rats to loading.","['Bake, Tina', 'Peris-Sampedro, Fiona', 'Waczek, Zita', 'Ohlsson, Claes', 'Palsdottir, Vilborg', 'Jansson, John-Olov', 'Dickson, Suzanne L']","['Bake T', 'Peris-Sampedro F', 'Waczek Z', 'Ohlsson C', 'Palsdottir V', 'Jansson JO', 'Dickson SL']","['Department of Physiology/Endocrine, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Physiology/Endocrine, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Physiology/Endocrine, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Centre of Bone and Arthritis Research, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Drug Treatment, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Region Vastra Gotaland, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Physiology/Endocrine, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Physiology/Endocrine, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Physiology/Endocrine, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Neuroendocrinol,Journal of neuroendocrinology,8913461,,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Body Weight Maintenance/physiology', 'Diet', 'Energy Intake/physiology', 'Female', 'Homeostasis/*physiology', 'Male', '*Obesity/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', '*Weight Gain', 'Weight-Bearing/*physiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['diet-induced obesity', 'energy homeostasis', 'fat mass', 'gravitostat', 'meal patterns']",,2021/07/10 06:00,2022/01/27 06:00,['2021/07/09 08:47'],"['2021/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/09 08:47 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jne.12997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neuroendocrinol. 2021 Aug;33(8):e12997. doi: 10.1111/jne.12997.

Drawing upon Self-Determination Theory, the purpose of this study was twofold. The first aim was to evaluate among obese adolescents the impact of a supervised exercise program supporting autonomy on their motivation to practice PA at the end of the intervention. The second aim was to evaluate the impact of the program on their level of PA one month after the end of the intervention. METHODS: Eighteen obese adolescents (mean age=14.3 years, mean BMI=33.47 kg/m(2)) were recruited to participate in an 11-week residential obesity treatment program. They received a 45-minute supervised exercise session each week. Motivational regulations were assessed at baseline and at the end of the intervention (via the Exercise Motivation Scale). PA practice was assessed at baseline and one month after the end of the intervention (via the 7-day PA recall interview). RESULTS: The analyses revealed that adolescents' levels of autonomy increased, that their levels of intrinsic motivation tended to increase, and that their level of external regulation tended to decrease. In addition, the participants increased their habitual PA practice one month after the end of the intervention in comparison to baseline. CONCLUSION: This study highlights that supporting autonomy during supervised exercise sessions appears as an effective strategy to promote PA among obese adolescents because it fosters internalization of the behavior.","['Gourlan, M', 'Sant, F', 'Boiche, J']","['Gourlan M', 'Sant F', 'Boiche J']","['Laboratory Epsylon EA4556 Dynamics of Human Capacities and Health Behaviors, University Montpellier 1 Montpellier, France - mathieugourlan@yahoo.fr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,J Sports Med Phys Fitness,The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,0376337,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Energy Metabolism', '*Exercise Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Motivation', 'Motor Activity', 'Obesity/metabolism/*psychology/*therapy', '*Personal Autonomy']",,,,,2014/10/29 06:00,2015/03/13 06:00,['2014/10/29 06:00'],"['2014/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['R40Y2014N06A0793 [pii]'],ppublish,J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 2014 Dec;54(6):793-801.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For epidemiological serial examinations the degrees of relative weight basing on optimum weight are a favourable basis for the classification of obesity.","['Mohr, M']",['Mohr M'],,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Z Gesamte Inn Med,Zeitschrift fur die gesamte innere Medizin und ihre Grenzgebiete,21730470R,,IM,"['Body Weight', 'Female', 'Germany, East', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/classification/*epidemiology', 'Sex Factors']",,,,,1977/05/15 00:00,1977/05/15 00:01,['1977/05/15 00:00'],"['1977/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1977/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Z Gesamte Inn Med. 1977 May 15;32(10):145-6 concl.,,,,,,,,,Zur Epidemiologie der Fettsucht.,,,,,,,,,,,

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Data from the 2000 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a telephone survey of 184,450 adults, were analyzed. Outcome measures included BMI, weight control practices (the intent to manage weight, and diet and physical activity patterns), and receipt of professional weight control advice. RESULTS: Of VA users, 44% were overweight and 25% were obese. After controlling for demographic factors, VA users were somewhat less likely to be overweight (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 1.00) but equally likely to be obese (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.27), compared with non-VA users. Among obese VA users, 75% reported trying to lose weight, and another 17% reported trying to maintain weight. Of these, only 40% decreased both calorie and fat intake. Only 27% of obese VA users who reported increasing exercise to lose weight followed recommendations for regular and sustained physical activity. Of obese VA users, 59% were inactive or irregularly active. Only 51% of obese VA users received professional advice to lose weight. Obese VA users were more likely than obese non-VA users to report trying to lose weight, modifying diet to lose weight by decreasing both calories and fat intake, and receiving professional weight control advice. DISCUSSION: Interventions for weight management programs in VA facilities need to take into account the high prevalence of overweight/obesity among VA users and should emphasize effective weight control practices.","['Wang, Anthea', 'Kinsinger, Linda S', 'Kahwati, Leila C', 'Das, Sandeep R', 'Gizlice, Ziya', 'Harvey, Richard T', 'Burdick, Mary B', 'Yevich, Steven J']","['Wang A', 'Kinsinger LS', 'Kahwati LC', 'Das SR', 'Gizlice Z', 'Harvey RT', 'Burdick MB', 'Yevich SJ']","['Department of Social Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Obes Res,Obesity research,9305691,,IM,"['Data Collection', 'Exercise', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*epidemiology/*prevention & control/therapy', 'Overweight', 'United States/epidemiology', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', '*Veterans']",,,,,2005/09/01 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/8/1405 [pii]', '10.1038/oby.2005.170 [doi]']",ppublish,Obes Res. 2005 Aug;13(8):1405-11. doi: 10.1038/oby.2005.170.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a potential causality between the volume of retrobulbar adipose tissue and the level of intraocular pressure in obese subjects compared with non-obese. METHODS: A total of 100 subjects were divided according to the body mass index (BMI), into two groups: normal weight (n = 50, BMI = 18-24.9 kg/m2) and obese (n = 50, BMI > or = 30 kg/m2) subjects. Anthropometric measurements, body composition analysis, measurement of intraocular pressure, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head at the level of the optic nerve, and the derived retrobulbar adipose tissue volume, were undertaken in all subjects. RESULTS: The obese subjects, as compared with normal weight ones, had a significantly higher mean retrobulbar adipose tissue volume (6.23 cm3 vs 4.85 cm3, p < 0.01) and intraocular pressure (15.96 mmHg vs 12.99 mmHg, p < 0.01). Furthermore, intraocular pressure correlated positively with retrobulbar adipose tissue volume. CONCLUSION: In obese people, elevated intraocular pressure may be caused by changes in ocular blood flow, affected by the physical pressure exerted by higher retrobulbar adiposity, and/or by internal vascular changes secondary to complications of obesity. These findings indicate the need for more frequent measurement of intraocular pressure in obese individuals to earlier detect glaucoma, and in so doing prevent irreversible blindness.","['Stojanov, Oliver', 'Stokic, Edita', 'Sveljo, Olivera', 'Naumovic, Nada']","['Stojanov O', 'Stokic E', 'Sveljo O', 'Naumovic N']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Health Center Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia. olis@neobee.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Serbia,Vojnosanit Pregl,Vojnosanitetski pregled,21530700R,,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Glaucoma/etiology', 'Humans', 'Intraocular Pressure/*physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/complications/pathology/*physiopathology']",,,,,2013/06/26 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/25 06:00'],"['2013/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/vsp1305469s [doi]'],ppublish,Vojnosanit Pregl. 2013 May;70(5):469-76. doi: 10.2298/vsp1305469s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even in specialized pediatric endocrinology clinics, low diagnostic yield is reported, but evidence is limited. Identifying these causes is vital for patient-tailored treatment. OBJECTIVES: To present the results of a systematic diagnostic workup in children and adolescents referred to a specialized pediatric obesity center. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study. Prevalence of underlying medical causes was determined after a multidisciplinary, systematic diagnostic workup including growth charts analysis, extensive biochemical and hormonal assessment and genetic testing in all patients. RESULTS: The diagnostic workup was completed in n = 282 patients. Median age was 10.8 years (IQR 7.7-14.1); median BMI +3.7SDS (IQR +3.3-+4.3). In 54 (19%) patients, a singular underlying medical cause was identified: in 37 patients genetic obesity, in 8 patients cerebral and in 9 patients medication-induced obesities. In total, thirteen different genetic obesity disorders were diagnosed. Obesity onset <5 years (p = 0.04) and hyperphagia (p = 0.001) were indicators of underlying genetic causes, but only in patients without intellectual disability (ID). Patients with genetic obesity with ID more often had a history of neonatal feeding problems (p = 0.003) and short stature (p = 0.005). BMI-SDS was not higher in patients with genetic obesity disorders (p = 0.52). Patients with cerebral and medication-induced obesities had lower height-SDS than the rest of the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the results of a systematic diagnostic workup aimed at identifying endocrine, genetic, cerebral or medication-induced causes of pediatric obesity. We found that a variety of singular underlying causes were identified in 19% of the patients with severe childhood obesity. Because of this heterogeneity, an extensive diagnostic approach is needed to establish the underlying medical causes and to facilitate disease-specific, patient-tailored treatment.","['Kleinendorst, Lotte', 'Abawi, Ozair', 'van der Voorn, Bibian', 'Jongejan, Mieke H T M', 'Brandsma, Annelies E', 'Visser, Jenny A', 'van Rossum, Elisabeth F C', 'van der Zwaag, Bert', 'Alders, Marielle', 'Boon, Elles M J', 'van Haelst, Mieke M', 'van den Akker, Erica L T']","['Kleinendorst L', 'Abawi O', 'van der Voorn B', 'Jongejan MHTM', 'Brandsma AE', 'Visser JA', 'van Rossum EFC', 'van der Zwaag B', 'Alders M', 'Boon EMJ', 'van Haelst MM', 'van den Akker ELT']","['Obesity Center CGG, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Obesity Center CGG, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Obesity Center CGG, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Obesity Center CGG, Franciscus Gasthuis, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Obesity Center CGG, Maasstad Ziekenhuis, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Obesity Center CGG, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Obesity Center CGG, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Genetics, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Brain Diseases/complications', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/diagnosis/etiology', 'Endocrine System Diseases/complications', 'Female', 'Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Intellectual Disability/complications', 'Male', 'Netherlands', 'Pediatric Obesity/diagnosis/*etiology/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective Studies']",PMC7209105,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2020/05/10 06:00,2020/08/04 06:00,['2020/05/09 06:00'],"['2020/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-20-05457 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0232990 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 May 8;15(5):e0232990. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0232990. eCollection 2020.,,20200508,['PLoS One. 2020 Dec 17;15(12):e0244508.

Esophageal pressure (P(es)) can be used as a surrogate for pleural pressure and can be used to guide PEEP titration. Although recent clinical data on P(es)-guided PEEP has shown no benefit, its utility in the subgroup of patients who are obese has not been studied. METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III critical care database was queried to gather data on P(es) in subjects on mechanical ventilation. P(es) in obese and non-obese groups were compared, and a subgroup analysis was performed in subjects with class III obesity. Thereafter, empirical and P(es)-guided PEEP protocols of a recently published trial were theoretically applied to the obese group and ventilator outcomes were compared. RESULTS: A total of 105 subjects were included in the study. The average end-expiratory P(es) in the obese group was 18.8 +/- 5 cm H(2)O compared with 16.8 +/- 4.8 cm H(2)O in the non-obese group (P < .05). If P(es)-guided PEEP protocol was to be applied to those in the obese group, then the PEEP setting would be significantly higher than empirical PEEP setting. These findings were accentuated in the subgroup of subjects with class III obesity.

The increasing pervasiveness of obesity and the growing appreciation of obesity's accompanying metabolic/inflammatory activities suggest rethinking the knee osteoarthritis paradigm. RECENT FINDINGS: Whereas once knee osteoarthritis was considered a 'wear-and-tear' condition, it is now recognized that knee osteoarthritis exists in the highly metabolic and inflammatory environments of adiposity. Cytokines associated with adipose tissue, including leptin, adiponectin, and resistin, may influence osteoarthritis though direct joint degradation or control of local inflammatory processes. Further, pound-for-pound, not all obesity is equivalent for the development of knee osteoarthritis; development appears to be strongly related to the co-existence of disordered glucose and lipid metabolism. Additionally, obesity loads may be detected by mechanoreceptors on chondrocyte surfaces triggering intracellular signaling cascades of cytokines, growth factors, and metalloproteinases. SUMMARY: This review summarizes recent literature about obesity, knee osteoarthritis and joint pain. Consideration of adipocytokines, metabolic factors, and mechanical loading-metabolic factor interactions will help to broaden the thinking about targets for both prevention and intervention for knee osteoarthritis.","['Sowers, MaryFran R', 'Karvonen-Gutierrez, Carrie A']","['Sowers MR', 'Karvonen-Gutierrez CA']","['Department of Epidemiology, Unversity of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. mfsowers@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Rheumatol,Current opinion in rheumatology,9000851,,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/complications/metabolism', 'Male', 'Obesity/*complications/metabolism', 'Osteoarthritis, Knee/*etiology/metabolism', 'Pain/etiology']",PMC3291123,,,,2010/05/21 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/05/21 06:00'],"['2010/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/BOR.0b013e32833b4682 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Rheumatol. 2010 Sep;22(5):533-7. doi: 10.1097/BOR.0b013e32833b4682.,"['AR040088/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR051384-05/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG017104-09/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG017104-10/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AR051384/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR020557/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG017104/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR051384/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['NIHMS358648'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inclusion criteria for the review were the following: randomized controlled trial; subjects aged 60 years or older; baseline BMI 27 or higher; weight loss versus baseline 3% or more or 2 kg; and trial duration 6 months or longer. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 16 articles on weight loss interventions that were examined in detail. Overall, these interventions led to significant benefits for those with osteoarthritis, coronary heart disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-2), while having slightly negative effects on bone mineral density and lean body mass. CONCLUSION: Longitudinal trials examining mortality and body weight suggest that maintaining weight is beneficial in older persons who become obese after age 65; in contrast, intervention trials show clinically important benefits of weight reduction with regard to osteoarthritis, physical function, and possibly DM-2 and coronary heart disease. Given these findings, we recommend that decisions about whether or not to institute a weight loss intervention for obese older persons be carefully considered on an individualized basis with special attention to the weight history and the medical conditions of each individual.","['Bales, Connie W', 'Buhr, Gwendolen']","['Bales CW', 'Buhr G']","['Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Durham VA Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA. bales001@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,J Am Med Dir Assoc,Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,100893243,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Middle Aged', '*Obesity/complications/epidemiology/mortality/physiopathology', 'Weight Loss/*physiology']",,,,,2008/06/04 09:00,2008/07/25 09:00,['2008/06/04 09:00'],"['2008/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-8610(08)00008-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jamda.2008.01.006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Med Dir Assoc. 2008 Jun;9(5):302-12. doi: 10.1016/j.jamda.2008.01.006.,,,,,,,73,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of preventive measures in children is to avoid the negative short- and long-term health problems associated with obesity. Primary prevention aims at establishing a healthy, active lifestyle and keeping children and adolescents within a range of body weight which is considered to be healthy. Constant availability and affordability of palatable and energy-dense food in the affluent society of the western world demands preventive strategies. Universal or public health prevention seems to be the most suitable form because several other cofactors of morbidity and mortality of affluent societies can also be prevented. However, in most European countries there is a lack of awareness of the necessity of prevention programmes, not only among the general population but also among the medical society. More awareness and consciousness to the problem of obesity must be generated in order to lead to effective therapeutic programmes. For those children and adolescents who are already obese, secondary prevention is mandatory. Therapeutic intervention programmes for the obese aim at long-term weight maintenance and normalisation of body weight and body fat. They have to modify eating and exercise behaviour of the obese child and establish new, healthier behaviour and lifestyle. Treatments programmes must include behavioural components in order to permanently change nutrition and physical exercise of the obese children and adolescents. However, long-term results of treatment programmes in European countries are scarce and the reported results, even of multidisciplinary regimens, are not impressive. CONCLUSION: In most European countries there is an urgent need not only for a growing awareness of the problem of obesity in children and adolescents but also for development of new comprehensive approaches in treating this group.","['Zwiauer, K F']",['Zwiauer KF'],"['Department of Paediatrics, Saint Poelten General Hospital, Austria. zwiauer@kfs.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Diet', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Obesity/etiology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Primary Prevention/*methods', 'Psychotherapy, Group', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,2000/09/30 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/30 11:00'],"['2000/09/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/30 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/pl00014367 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2000 Sep;159 Suppl 1:S56-68. doi: 10.1007/pl00014367.,,,,,,,113,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we model the effect on health outcomes of (i) reducing the prevalence of obesity when entering adulthood; (ii) reducing the risk of becoming obese throughout adult life; and (iii) combinations of both approaches. We found that, while all approaches reduce the prevalence of chronic diseases and improve life expectancy, a given percentage reduction in obesity prevalence achieved during childhood had a smaller effect than the same percentage reduction in the risk of becoming obese applied throughout adulthood. A small increase in the probability of becoming obese during adulthood offsets a substantial reduction in prevalence of overweight/obesity achieved during childhood, with the gains from a 50% reduction in child obesity prevalence offset by a 10% increase in the probability of becoming obese in adulthood. We conclude that both policy approaches can improve the health profile throughout the life course of a cohort, but they are not equivalent, and a large reduction in child obesity prevalence may be reversed by a small increase in the risk of becoming overweight or obese in adulthood.","['Lhachimi, S K', 'Nusselder, W J', 'Lobstein, T J', 'Smit, H A', 'Baili, P', 'Bennett, K', 'Kulik, M C', 'Jackson-Leach, R', 'Boshuizen, H C', 'Mackenbach, J P']","['Lhachimi SK', 'Nusselder WJ', 'Lobstein TJ', 'Smit HA', 'Baili P', 'Bennett K', 'Kulik MC', 'Jackson-Leach R', 'Boshuizen HC', 'Mackenbach JP']","['Department of Public Health, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. s.lhachimi@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Obes Rev,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,100897395,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Life Expectancy', '*Models, Biological', 'Obesity/*complications/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Prevalence', '*Risk Assessment']",,,,,2013/04/23 06:00,2013/11/02 06:00,['2013/04/23 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/obr.12029 [doi]'],ppublish,Obes Rev. 2013 Jul;14(7):523-31. doi: 10.1111/obr.12029.

Essential hypertension and obesity are commonly accompanied by insulin resistance (defined as impaired insulin-mediated glucose disposal) and hyperinsulinaemia. In the offspring of patients with essential hypertension, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, as well as related increases in serum low density lipoproteins and triglycerides, often occur prior to the development of essential hypertension, overweight or central redistribution of body fat. Moreover, once obesity, and in particular central obesity, is present, insulin resistance is more marked in hypertensive than in normotensive obese subjects. Hyperinsulinaemia and/or insulin resistance in turn promote body fat deposition and impaired glucose tolerance. This cycle helps to explain why a familial predisposition to essential hypertension poses an increased risk of developing not only hypertension but also dyslipidaemia, obesity and non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes. It is still unclear whether insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinaemia also promote hypertension per se. Regardless of insulin's exact pathogenic role, obesity and/or a high dietary intake of carbohydrates, salt, etc. can induce several potential pressor mechanisms: 1) higher plasma noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and adrenaline (epinephrine) levels, suggesting a higher sympathetic tone in obese than in nonobese subjects, and in hypertensive obese than in normotensive obese subjects; 2) similarly, a tendency to hyperaldosteronism, with largely normal plasma renin activity, in obese hypertensive patients; 3) enhanced sensitivity of blood pressure to salt; 4) increased total blood volume (although it is normal relative to body surface area), leading to increased cardiac output and eventually eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy; and 5) increased cytosolic free Ca++ levels and reduced intracellular Mg++ levels in the blood cells of obese hypertensive patients and patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes, although this finding cannot necessarily be extrapolated to cationic levels in vascular muscle cells. Total peripheral vascular resistance is usually low in normotensive obese subjects and rises with the development of hypertension; compared with lean patients with essential hypertension, obese hypertensive patients tend to have a slightly lower level of total peripheral vasoconstriction and a slightly higher cardiac output. Considering the intimate association between essential hypertension and obesity, as well as the prevalence and prognostic relevance of this combination, the spectrum of accompanying metabolic and cardiovascular abnormalities deserves careful consideration in the evaluation of therapeutic care for such patients.","['Weidmann, P', 'de Courten, M', 'Boehlen, L', 'Shaw, S']","['Weidmann P', 'de Courten M', 'Boehlen L', 'Shaw S']","['Medizinische Poliklinik, University of Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,,IM,"['Humans', 'Hypertension/complications/*physiopathology', 'Obesity/complications/*physiopathology']",,,,,1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003495-199300462-00030 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 1993;46 Suppl 2:197-208; discussion 208-9. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199300462-00030.,,,,,,,107,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Particularly, the role of its main health-related components such as higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and muscular fitness in the MHO phenotype needs to be reviewed in depth. The present review aimed to: 1) contribute to the characterization of the MHO phenotype by examining whether MHO individuals are fitter than metabolically abnormal obese (MAO) individuals in terms of CRF and other PF components; 2) review the role of CRF and other PF components in the prognosis of MHO. The studies reviewed suggest that a higher CRF level should be considered a characteristic of the MHO phenotype. Likewise, CRF seems to play a key role in the prognosis of the MHO individuals, yet this statement is based on a single study and future studies need to confirm or contrast these findings. Comparability of studies is difficult due to the different definitions used for MHO; consequently, the present review makes a proposal for harmonizing this definition in adults and in youth. Obesity is still related to an important number of comorbidities; therefore, the public health message remains to fight against both obesity and low CRF in both adult and pediatric populations.","['Ortega, Francisco B', 'Cadenas-Sanchez, Cristina', 'Sui, Xuemei', 'Blair, Steven N', 'Lavie, Carl J']","['Ortega FB', 'Cadenas-Sanchez C', 'Sui X', 'Blair SN', 'Lavie CJ']","['PROFITH ""PROmoting FITness and Health through physical activity"" Research Group, Department of Physical Education and Sports, School of Sport Sciences, University of Granada, Spain; Department of Biosciences and Nutrition at NOVUM, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.

Whereas hypometabolism may initiate obesity in some people, once obese, individuals tend to manifest a higher resting metabolic rate because of their greater fat-free mass, exhibit an impaired thermic response to food, and expend more calories than lean individuals for equivalent amounts of activity. As a result, over a 24-h period, obese people generally expend more energy than lean people. A second determinant of obesity is related to fuel utilization and suggests that those predisposed to be obese may have an innate insulin resistance in muscle, leading to decreased uptake, oxidation, and storage of glucose in this tissue. As a result, the glucose is shunted to adipose tissue, where it is stored. With regard to treatment of obesity, emphasis on increased energy expenditure through the inclusion of reasonable amounts of activity is essential. However, this must always be combined with restraint in caloric intake.","['Pi-Sunyer, F X']",['Pi-Sunyer FX'],"[""St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital, Columbia University, New York, New York.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Nutrition,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",8802712,['IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)'],IM,"['Energy Intake', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Exercise', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*metabolism/*therapy']",,,,,1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nutrition. 1991 Jul-Aug;7(4):292-4.,,,,,,,17,['Nutrition. 1992 May-Jun;8(3):198.

Some of the contributing genetic factors that have not yet been examined in detail entail mRNA polyadenylation (PA). Genes with multiple PA sites express mRNA isoforms differing in coding sequence or 3'UTR through alternative polyadenylation (APA). Alterations in PA have been associated with various diseases; however, its contribution to obesity is not well-researched. Following an 11-week high-fat diet, the APA sites in the hypothalamus of two unique mouse models for polygenic obesity (Fat line) and healthy leanness (Lean line) were determined using whole transcriptome termini site sequencing (WTTS-seq). We found 17 genes of interest with differentially expressed APA (DE-APA) isoforms, among which seven were previously associated with obesity or obesity-related traits (Pdxdc1, Smyd3, Rpl14, Copg1, Pcna, Ric3, Stx3) but have not yet been studied in the context of APA. The remaining ten genes (Ccdc25, Dtd2, Gm14403, Hlf, Lyrm7, Mrpl3, Pisd-ps3, Sbsn, Slx1b, Spon1) represent novel candidates associated with obesity/adiposity due to variability brought about by differential usage of APA sites. Our results provide insights into the relationship between PA and the hypothalamus in the context of obesity, by being the first study of DE-APA sites and DE-APA isoforms in these mouse models. Future studies are needed further to explore the role of APA isoforms in polygenic obesity by expanding the scope of research to other metabolically important tissues (such as liver and adipose tissues) and investigating the potential for targeting PA as a therapeutic strategy for obesity management.","['Mikec, Spela', 'Horvat, Simon', 'Wang, Hongyang', 'Michal, Jennifer', 'Kunej, Tanja', 'Jiang, Zhihua']","['Mikec S', 'Horvat S', 'Wang H', 'Michal J', 'Kunej T', 'Jiang Z']","['University of Ljubljana, Biotechnical Faculty, Department of Animal Science, Domzale, Slovenia; Washington State University, Department of Animal Sciences, Pullman, WA, 99164-7620, USA.', 'University of Ljubljana, Biotechnical Faculty, Department of Animal Science, Domzale, Slovenia.', 'Washington State University, Department of Animal Sciences, Pullman, WA, 99164-7620, USA.', 'Washington State University, Department of Animal Sciences, Pullman, WA, 99164-7620, USA.', 'University of Ljubljana, Biotechnical Faculty, Department of Animal Science, Domzale, Slovenia.

METHODS: To explore the relationship between increased body mass and gene expression in blood, we conducted whole-genome expression profiling of whole blood from seventeen obese and seventeen well matched lean subjects. Gene expression data was analyzed at the individual gene and pathway level and a preliminary assessment of the predictive value of blood gene expression profiles in obesity was carried out. RESULTS: Principal components analysis of whole-blood gene expression data from obese and lean subjects led to efficient separation of the two cohorts. Pathway analysis by gene-set enrichment demonstrated increased transcript levels for genes belonging to the ""ribosome"", ""apoptosis"" and ""oxidative phosphorylation"" pathways in the obese cohort, consistent with an altered metabolic state including increased protein synthesis, enhanced cell death from proinflammatory or lipotoxic stimuli, and increased energy demands. A subset of pathway-specific genes acted as efficient predictors of obese or lean class membership when used in Naive Bayes or logistic regression based classifiers. CONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive characterization of the whole blood transcriptome in obesity and demonstrates that the investigation of gene expression profiles from whole blood can inform and illustrate the biological processes related to regulation of body mass. Additionally, the ability of pathway-related gene expression to predict class membership suggests the feasibility of a similar approach for identifying clinically useful blood-based predictors of weight loss success following dietary or surgical interventions.","['Ghosh, Sujoy', 'Dent, Robert', 'Harper, Mary-Ellen', 'Gorman, Shelby A', 'Stuart, Joan S', 'McPherson, Ruth']","['Ghosh S', 'Dent R', 'Harper ME', 'Gorman SA', 'Stuart JS', 'McPherson R']","['Biomedical Biotechnology Research Institute, North Carolina Central University, Durham, USA. sghosh@nccu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/blood/epidemiology/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Sex Factors']",PMC3014865,,,,2010/12/03 06:00,2011/03/16 06:00,['2010/12/03 06:00'],"['2010/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1755-8794-3-56 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-3-56 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2010 Dec 1;3:56. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-3-56.,"['R21 DK088319-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '1R21DK088319-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 DK088319/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 DK088319-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '5R25HL059868-10/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",20101201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complex pathological processes reflect environmental and genetic interactions, and individuals from disadvantaged communities seem to have greater risks than more affluent individuals partly because of fetal and postnatal imprinting. Obesity, with its array of comorbidities, necessitates careful clinical assessment to identify underlying factors and to allow coherent management. The epidemic reflects progressive secular and age-related decreases in physical activity, together with substantial dietary changes with passive over-consumption of energy despite the neurobiological processes controlling food intake.

Although the diagnosis BED was created with the obese in mind, obesity is not a criterion. This paper gives an overview of its epidemiology, characteristics, aetiology, criteria, course and treatment. BED seems to be highly prevalent among subjects seeking weight loss treatment (1.3-30.1%). Studies with compared BED, BN and obesity indicated that individuals with BED exhibit levels of psychopathology that fall somewhere between the high levels reported by individuals with BN and the low levels reported by obese individuals. Characteristics of BED seemed to bear a closer resemblance to those of BN than of those of obesity.A review of RCT's showed that presently cognitive behavioural treatment is the treatment of choice but interpersonal psychotherapy, self-help and SSRI's seem effective. The first aim of treatment should be the cessation of binge eating. Treatment of weight loss may be offered to those who are able to abstain from binge eating.","['Dingemans, A E', 'Bruna, M J', 'van Furth, E F']","['Dingemans AE', 'Bruna MJ', 'van Furth EF']","['Robert-Fleury Stichting, National Centre for Eating Disorders, Leidschendam, The Netherlands. a.dingemans@robertfleury.nl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord,International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,9313169,,IM,"['Bulimia', '*Feeding and Eating Disorders/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Obesity/complications/epidemiology/psychology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Weight Loss']",,,,,2002/03/16 10:00,2002/04/18 10:01,['2002/03/16 10:00'],"['2000/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2001/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2001/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/03/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.ijo.0801949 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord. 2002 Mar;26(3):299-307. doi: 10.1038/sj.ijo.0801949.,,,,,,,91,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This increase has been accompanied by a dramatic rise in obesity-related health complications among American youth. Thus, many obese youth are now experiencing illnesses that will threaten their life expectancy in the absence of significant weight loss. Despite these concerns, a relatively modest body of research has focused on the treatment of adolescent obesity. Results from trials investigating the efficacy of behavioral and pharmacological treatments, like studies of these interventions with adults, suggest that individuals typically lose 5-10% of their initial weight. Unfortunately, weight regain is common. Given the increase in the number of obese adolescents, coupled with the modest results from more conservative treatment approaches, it is not surprising that bariatric surgery for adolescents who suffer from extreme obesity has grown in popularity. The weight losses after surgery are impressive and many adolescents, like adults, experience significant improvements in their physical and mental health postoperatively. However, only a small fraction of adolescents and adults who are heavy enough for bariatric surgery present for surgical treatment. Among those who undergo surgery, a significant minority appear to struggle with a number of behavioral and psychosocial issues that threaten their lifelong success. With all of this in mind, the current obesity problem in the United States and other Westernized countries likely will present a significant challenge to both current and future medical and mental health professionals who work with adolescents and young adults.","['Sarwer, David B', 'Dilks, Rebecca J']","['Sarwer DB', 'Dilks RJ']",,['eng'],['Editorial'],United States,J Youth Adolesc,Journal of youth and adolescence,0333507,['0 (Anti-Obesity Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Obesity Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bariatric Surgery/psychology', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Binge-Eating Disorder/complications', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Obesity/complications/epidemiology/psychology/*therapy', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Weight Reduction Programs']",,,,,2011/06/01 06:00,2012/08/31 06:00,['2011/06/01 06:00'],"['2011/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10964-011-9677-z [doi]'],ppublish,J Youth Adolesc. 2012 Jan;41(1):98-104. doi: 10.1007/s10964-011-9677-z.

Although not widely known, individuals with a weight history in the overweight (BMI-for-age >/=85th percentile but <95th percentile, as defined by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts) or obese (BMI-for-age >/=95th percentile, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts) range, represent a substantial portion of adolescents presenting for ED treatment. Given research that suggests that early intervention promotes the best chance of recovery, it is imperative that these children's and adolescents' ED symptoms are identified and that intervention is offered before the disease progresses. This report presents 2 examples of EDs that developed in the context of obese adolescents' efforts to reduce their weight. Each case shows specific challenges in the identification of ED behaviors in adolescents with this weight history and the corresponding delay such teenagers experience accessing appropriate treatment.","['Sim, Leslie A', 'Lebow, Jocelyn', 'Billings, Marcie']","['Sim LA', 'Lebow J', 'Billings M']","['Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905. sim.leslie@mayo.edu.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior/psychology', 'Feeding and Eating Disorders/*complications/*diagnosis/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*complications/*diagnosis/psychology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['eating disorders', 'obesity']",,2013/09/11 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/09/11 06:00'],"['2013/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2012-3940 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2012-3940 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2013 Oct;132(4):e1026-30. doi: 10.1542/peds.2012-3940.

These conditions can lead to changes in gut homeostasis, compromising tolerance to luminal antigens and increasing susceptibility to food allergies. The underlying mechanisms for this phenomenon are not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigated changes in the intestinal mucosa of diet-induced obese mice and found that they exhibited increased gut permeability and reduced Treg cells frequency. Upon oral treatment with ovalbumin (OVA), obese mice failed to develop oral tolerance. However, hyperglycemia treatment improved intestinal permeability and oral tolerance induction in mice. Furthermore, we observed that obese mice exhibited a more severe food allergy to OVA, and this allergy was alleviated after treatment with a hypoglycemic drug. Importantly, our findings were translated to obese humans. Individuals with T2D had higher serum IgE levels and downregulated genes related to gut homeostasis. Taken together, our results suggest that obesity-induced hyperglycemia can lead to a failure in oral tolerance and to exacerbation of food allergy. These findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying the relationship among obesity, T2D, and gut mucosal immunity, which could inform the development of new therapeutic approaches.","['Torres, Licia', 'Camila Goncalves Miranda, Mariana', 'Dantas Martins, Vinicius', 'Caixeta, Felipe', 'de Almeida Oliveira, Mariana', 'Martins Trindade, Luisa', 'Carvalho de Assis, Helder', 'Nascimento, Valbert', 'Pinheiro Rosa, Natalia', 'Gomes, Eliane', 'Oliveira Almeida, Sophia', 'Marquet, Florian', 'Genser, Laurent', 'Marcelin, Genevieve', 'Clement, Karine', 'Russo, Momtchilo', 'Maria Caetano Faria, Ana', 'Uceli Maioli, Tatiani']","['Torres L', 'Camila Goncalves Miranda M', 'Dantas Martins V', 'Caixeta F', 'de Almeida Oliveira M', 'Martins Trindade L', 'Carvalho de Assis H', 'Nascimento V', 'Pinheiro Rosa N', 'Gomes E', 'Oliveira Almeida S', 'Marquet F', 'Genser L', 'Marcelin G', 'Clement K', 'Russo M', 'Maria Caetano Faria A', 'Uceli Maioli T']","['Departamento de Bioquimica e Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Elliot and Roslyn Jaffe Food Allergy Institute Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias dos Alimentos, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Laboratorio de Imuno-inflamacao, Departamento de Genetica, Evolucao, Microbiologia e Imunologia, Instituto de Biologia, Universidade de Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias dos Alimentos, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Imunobiologia, Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo (ICB/USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition et Obesities; Systemic Approaches, NutriOmique, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition et Obesities; systemic approaches, NutriOmique, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Nutrition Department, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France; Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition et Obesities; systemic approaches, NutriOmique, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Visceral Surgery Department, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition et Obesities; Systemic Approaches, NutriOmique, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition et Obesities; systemic approaches, NutriOmique, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Nutrition Department, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France; Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition et Obesities; systemic approaches, NutriOmique, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Visceral Surgery Department, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.', 'Laboratorio de Imunobiologia, Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo (ICB/USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Departamento de Nutricao, Escola de Enfermagem, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

By the year 2030-2035 over 20% of the adult US population and over 25% of the Europeans will be aged 65 years and older. The predicted prevalence of obesity in Americans, 60 years and older was 37% in 2010. The predicted prevalence of obesity in Europe in 2015 varies between 20 and 30% dependent on the model used. This means 20.9 million obese 60+ people in the USA in 2010 and 32 million obese elders in 2015 in the EU. Although cut-off values of BMI, waist circumference and percentages of fat mass have not been defined for the elderly (nor for the elderly of different ethnicity), it is clear from several meta-analyses that mortality and morbidity associated with overweight and obesity only increases at a BMI above 30 kg/m(2). Thus, treatment should only be offered to patients who are obese rather than overweight and who also have functional impairments, metabolic complications or obesity-related diseases, that can benefit from weight loss. The weight loss therapy should aim to minimize muscle and bone loss but also vigilance as regards the development of sarcopenic obesity - a combination of an unhealthy excess of body fat with a detrimental loss of muscle and fat-free mass including bone - is important in the elderly, who are vulnerable to this outcome. Life-style intervention should be the first step and consists of a diet with a 500 kcal (2.1 MJ) energy deficit and an adequate intake of protein of high biological quality together with calcium and vitamin D, behavioural therapy and multi-component exercise. Multi-component exercise includes flexibility training, balance training, aerobic exercise and resistance training. The adherence rate in most studies is around 75%. Knowledge of constraints and modulators of physical inactivity should be of help to engage the elderly in physical activity. The role of pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery in the elderly is largely unknown as in most studies people aged 65 years and older have been excluded.","['Mathus-Vliegen, Elisabeth M H']",['Mathus-Vliegen EM'],"['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. e.mathus-vliegen@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Obes Facts,Obesity facts,101469429,['0 (Anti-Obesity Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Obesity Agents/therapeutic use', 'Behavior Therapy', '*Diet', '*Exercise', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Life Style', '*Obesity/complications/epidemiology/physiopathology/therapy', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', '*Weight Loss']",,,,,2012/07/17 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/07/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['000341193 [pii]', '10.1159/000341193 [doi]']",ppublish,Obes Facts. 2012;5(3):460-83. doi: 10.1159/000341193.

The depth of available literature regarding obesity's effect on drug safety, pharmacokinetics, and dosing in obese children is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic literature review describing the current evidence of the effect of obesity on drug disposition in children. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched the MEDLINE, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases (January 1, 1970-December 31, 2012) and included studies if they contained data on drug clearance, volume of distribution, or drug concentration in obese children (aged </=18 years). We compared exposure and weight-normalized volume of distribution and clearance between obese and nonobese children. We explored the association between drug physicochemical properties and clearance and volume of distribution. FINDINGS: Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria and contained pharmacokinetic data for 21 drugs. The median number of obese children studied per drug was 10 (range, 1-112) and ages ranged from newborn to 29 years (1 study described pharmacokinetics in children and adults together). Dosing schema varied and were either a fixed dose (6 [29%]) or based on body weight (10 [48%]) and body surface area (4 [19%]). Clinically significant pharmacokinetic alterations were observed in obese children for 65% (11 of 17) of the studied drugs. Pharmacokinetic alterations resulted in substantial differences in exposure between obese and nonobese children for 38% (5 of 13) of the drugs.

9225171,NLM,MEDLINE,19970827,20220316,,21 Suppl 3,,1997 Jun,The role of dietary fat in obesity.,S2-11,,"EPIDEMIOLOGY: Epidemiological evidence suggests that a high-fat diet promotes the development of obesity and that there is a direct relationship between the amount of dietary fat and the degree of obesity. The importance of this relationship has been shown in black prepubescent females, who consumed more calories as fat than white females. Moreover, black adult females are heavier and have significant higher cardiovascular disease mortality rates than white females. THE INFLUENCE OF DIETARY FAT ON FOOD INTAKE: An overview of animal studies had indicated that high-fat diets induce greater food intake and weight gain than high-carbohydrate diets. Several factors such as caloric density, satiety properties and post-absorbtive processing can contribute to this different response to high-fat diets. Accordingly, the satiating effects after meals with a high fat:carbohydrate ratio is less than for meals with a lower ratio. Some authors have reported that the most important variable influencing meal size is not the level of hunger but the nutrient content of the range of foods consumed. Thus dietary fat has a weak effect on satiety and we suggest that periodic exposure to a high-fat meal, particularly when hunger is high, may be sufficient to lead to overconsumption of energy as fat in obese patients. DIETARY FAT AND FAT BALANCE: Energy balance is well correlated with fat balance in lean controls, whereas there is no correlation with either carbohydrate or protein balances. Several authors have shown that carbohydrate and protein storage is closely regulated by adjusting oxidation to intake, whereas fat is almost exclusively used or stored in response to day-to-day fluctuations in energy balance. The positive relationship between fat intake and lipid oxidation seen in lean controls appears not to be present in obese patients. On high-fat diets, post-obese women failed to increase the ratio of fat to carbohydrate oxidation appropriately. Increasing dietary fat results in preferential fat storage in post-obese women, impaired suppression of carbohydrate and reduction of 24h energy expenditure. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary fat induces overconsumption and weight gain through its low satiety properties and high caloric density. Obese and post-obese subjects do not appear to adapt to dietary fat, and therefore fat storage is increased.","['Golay, A', 'Bobbioni, E']","['Golay A', 'Bobbioni E']","['Teaching Diabetic Division, Geneva University Hospital, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord,International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,9313169,['0 (Dietary Fats)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dietary Fats/*adverse effects/*metabolism', 'Energy Intake', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/diet therapy/epidemiology/*etiology/*metabolism']",,,,,1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord. 1997 Jun;21 Suppl 3:S2-11.,,,,,,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weight loss is clearly the most desirable goal in obese subjects management. Successful obesity treatment should be defined as long-term weight loss maintenance. In this chapter, we briefly review the current evidences regarding the treatment of obesity. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and PubMed for original articles published between 1995 and 2006, focusing on obesity treatment. The search terms we used, alone or in combination, were 'obesity', 'lifestyle changes', 'diet', 'exercise', 'pharmacological treatment', 'surgical treatment'. CONCLUSIONS: The conventional management of obese patients involves weight reduction with lifestyle changes, including dietary therapy and increased physical activity, or a combined approach with lifestyle changes and pharmacological or surgical interventions. Exercise appears crucial in the successful maintenance of weight loss and in fostering cardiovascular health in obese patients. Some anti-obesity drugs, such as sibutramine and orlistat, have been shown to induce a significant weight loss and long-term weight loss maintenance. Surgical therapy is often necessary in morbidly obese patients and generally results in more significant and long-lasting weight loss than other treatments.","['Sharma, Arya M', 'Iacobellis, Gianluca']","['Sharma AM', 'Iacobellis G']","['Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Obesity Research and Management at the Michael G. deGroote School of Medicine, Hamilton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Contrib Nephrol,Contributions to nephrology,7513582,['0 (Anti-Obesity Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Obesity Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Exercise', 'Humans', '*Life Style', 'Obesity/*drug therapy/*surgery']",,,,,2006/08/25 09:00,2006/10/19 09:00,['2006/08/25 09:00'],"['2006/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['000095331 [pii]', '10.1159/000095331 [doi]']",ppublish,Contrib Nephrol. 2006;151:212-220. doi: 10.1159/000095331.,,,,,,,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concept of the ""adiposity rebound"" helps with this decision. The child's family is important and contributes to his or her body adiposity through both nature--an inherited metabolic tendency towards obesity--and nurture--the eating and activity environment and the family functioning. The activity level and energy intake, which although out of balance for the obese child, may not be low or excessive when compared to recommended amounts for children of that age or to that of peers. A child-family pattern can be defined in overweight children based on presence of a metabolic tendency, energy intake, activity level, and family functioning. In looking at the pattern rather than just the child's weight, the clinician can be much more effective with a weight control program, and with proper referral for changing family functioning prior to such a program if necessary.","['Mahan, L K']",['Mahan LK'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Clin North Am,Pediatric clinics of North America,0401126,,IM,"['Behavior Therapy/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Family', 'Humans', 'Obesity/psychology/*therapy']",,,,,1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0031-3955(16)36298-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0031-3955(16)36298-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Clin North Am. 1987 Aug;34(4):983-96. doi: 10.1016/s0031-3955(16)36298-8.,,,,,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A time demanding therapeutic strategy in obesity management should be taken into account by both health policy makers and health insurance companies.","['Hainer, V', 'Kunesova, M', 'Parizkova, J', 'Stich, V', 'Slaba, S', 'Fried, M', 'Malkova, I']","['Hainer V', 'Kunesova M', 'Parizkova J', 'Stich V', 'Slaba S', 'Fried M', 'Malkova I']","['General Faculty Hospital, IIIrd Department of Internal Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Guideline', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Sb Lek,Sbornik lekarsky,0025770,,IM,"['Czech Republic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/complications/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic']",,,,,1999/06/08 00:00,1999/06/08 00:01,['1999/06/08 00:00'],"['1999/06/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sb Lek. 1998;99(3):235-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, one of the most marked disabilities arising from obesity is a reduced exercise tolerance, so severely obese patients are unable to perform the exercise which would bring these benefits. It has been suggested that exercise may confer benefits on the obese person by reducing voluntary food intake, or by causing a prolonged elevation of metabolic rate. There is no good evidence for these claims. Obesity is best treated by a combination of dietary restriction and exercise: the more severe the obesity the more important the diet component of treatment, but exercise becomes more important with the management of mild obesity or the prevention of obesity.","['Garrow, J S']",['Garrow JS'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Sweden,Acta Med Scand Suppl,Acta medica Scandinavica.

These effects are important for a better control of body weight in the obese individual and should enable him or her to involve adipose tissue to a lesser extent in this regulation. Physical activity favours a negative energy and fat balance, particularly if activities are prolonged and vigorous. The achievement of a negative energy and fat balance with physical activity also strongly depends on the nutritional context in which it is performed. In the long term, an active lifestyle and low-fat food habits are expected to induce a substantial body weight loss in the obese. This weight loss is progressively attenuated over time, presumably because of the decreased impact of a reduced adipose tissue mass on the regulation of energy and fat balance. For the obese individual complying with an activity programme and healthy food habits, a body weight loss of 10% is a realistic goal before the occurrence of resistance to further loss of body fat.","['Tremblay, A']",['Tremblay A'],"['Division of Kinesiology, Laval University, Ste-Foy, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab,Bailliere's best practice & research.

Here, we describe a novel obesity syndrome caused by interspecific hybridization in the genus Mus and show that this obesity, appearing sporadically in F1 littermates derived from inbred strains, has an epigenetic basis. Mus hybrids from various strains of M. musculus and M. spretus were generated and the sporadic obese phenotype was confirmed through assessment of physiological and biochemical parameters in littermates. To understand the underlying mechanisms, large-scale and candidate gene expression assays, global DNA methylation assays and allelic expression analysis were performed. Studies showed that obese hybrids are similar to other known models of obesity. While increased axial growth indicated a defect in POMC pathway, comparison of global gene expression patterns in brain of obese F1 and obese Pomc mutant mice showed little similarity. In F1 obese mice many genes involved in the maintenance of epigenetic states, as well as several imprinted genes, were differentially expressed. Global DNA methylation analysis in brain showed that increased methylation levels were associated with obesity. The imprinted gene Gnasxl, known to be important in lipid homeostasis, was found over expressed in the obese hybrids. Allelic expression and methylation analysis of Gnasxl showed that alterations of epigenetic marks underlying F1 obesity are probably many and multi-factorial. CONCLUSIONS: This model of obesity, which is both spontaneous and epigenetic, may be a useful tool to address the epigenetic aspects of clinical obesity.","['Singh, Umashankar', 'Rizvi, Farhan', 'Yu, Yang', 'Shi, Wei', 'Orth, Annie', 'Karimi, Mohsen', 'Ekstrom, Tomas J', 'Plagge, Antonius', 'Kelsey, Gavin', 'Fundele, Reinald']","['Singh U', 'Rizvi F', 'Yu Y', 'Shi W', 'Orth A', 'Karimi M', 'Ekstrom TJ', 'Plagge A', 'Kelsey G', 'Fundele R']","['Department of Development and Genetics, Evolutionary Biology Center, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Physiol Biochem,Archives of physiology and biochemistry,9510153,,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Homeostasis/genetics', 'Hybridization, Genetic/*genetics', 'Lipid Metabolism/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Obese', 'Obesity/*genetics/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype']",,,,,2008/12/17 09:00,2009/03/06 09:00,['2008/12/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [medline]']","['906578311 [pii]', '10.1080/13813450802542495 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Physiol Biochem. 2008 Dec;114(5):301-30. doi: 10.1080/13813450802542495.,"['BBS/E/B/00001169/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research', 'Council/United Kingdom', 'BBS/E/B/0000C169/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research', 'Council/United Kingdom', 'G0400155/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BED status did not moderate psychological responses to treatment: both BED and non-BED samples experienced large post-treatment reductions in depression. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","['Blaine, B', 'Rodman, J']","['Blaine B', 'Rodman J']","['Psychology Department, St. John Fisher College, Rochester, NY 14618, USA. bblaine@sjfc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",Germany,Eat Weight Disord,Eating and weight disorders : EWD,9707113,,IM,"['Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Bulimia/*complications/psychology', 'Depressive Disorder/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/complications/psychology/*therapy', '*Weight Loss']",,,,,2007/07/07 09:00,2007/07/11 09:00,['2007/07/07 09:00'],"['2007/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['3743 [pii]', '10.1007/BF03327579 [doi]']",ppublish,Eat Weight Disord. 2007 Jun;12(2):54-60. doi: 10.1007/BF03327579.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Psychiatric (using the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV), medical, and laboratory assessments of 44 obese males with BED were compared with assessments from 44 age- and race-matched obese females with BED seeking weight loss treatment. RESULTS: High rates of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and metabolic syndrome were observed in the population as a whole. Obese males with BED had attempted significantly fewer diets, medications and supplements for weight loss before seeking weight loss treatment. The two genders did not differ significantly in any other of the examined variables. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that while obese men and women with BED who present for weight management are very similar, males had fewer previous attempts at weight loss, possibly related to their less pronounced body dissatisfaction or fewer help-seeking behaviors as compared to females. Our results also support findings of substantial comorbidity among obesity, BED, mood and anxiety disorders, and metabolic syndrome in weight loss seeking populations, in men as well as women.","['Guerdjikova, A I', 'McElroy, S L', 'Kotwal, R', 'Keck, P E Jr']","['Guerdjikova AI', 'McElroy SL', 'Kotwal R', 'Keck PE Jr']","['Psychopharmacology Research Program, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267-0559, USA. guerdja@ucmail.uc.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Eat Weight Disord,Eating and weight disorders : EWD,9707113,,IM,"['Adult', 'Body Image', 'Bulimia Nervosa/*psychology', 'Diet, Reducing', 'Female', '*Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/metabolism/*psychology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Weight Loss']",,,,,2007/03/27 09:00,2007/04/03 09:00,['2007/03/27 09:00'],"['2007/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['3465 [pii]', '10.1007/BF03327777 [doi]']",ppublish,Eat Weight Disord. 2007 Mar;12(1):e19-23. doi: 10.1007/BF03327777.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The subjects were randomly divided into two groups, one that participated in aerobic conditioning and one that did not. The amount of oxygen consumption, as an index of physical fitness, and performance on selected subscales of the Tennessee Self-concept Scale (TSCS) were measured before and after the training and conditioning programs. Both groups displayed significant increases in oxygen consumption and on the Physical Self and Self-satisfaction subscales, but on all these measures, the Conditioning Group increased significantly (2 to 3 times) more. For both groups, the Total Variability measure from the TSCS showed significant reductions, which have been associated with personality integration. These results demonstrate that physical conditioning and dietary educational sessions or educational sessions alone are associated with positive changes in self-concept in obese individuals and also corroborate other studies that show links between physical and psychological fitness.","['Short, M A', 'DiCarlo, S', 'Steffee, W P', 'Pavlou, K']","['Short MA', 'DiCarlo S', 'Steffee WP', 'Pavlou K']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Phys Ther,Physical therapy,0022623,,IM,"['Adult', 'Exercise Test', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/metabolism/*psychology/therapy', 'Oxygen Consumption', '*Physical Education and Training', 'Physical Fitness', 'Psychological Tests', '*Self Concept']",,,,,1984/02/01 00:00,1984/02/01 00:01,['1984/02/01 00:00'],"['1984/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ptj/64.2.194 [doi]'],ppublish,Phys Ther. 1984 Feb;64(2):194-8. doi: 10.1093/ptj/64.2.194.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: This article is a review of the available literature on obesity, the physiologic changes that occur in obese patients, and the impact of these changes on laparoscopy outcomes. RESULTS: Obesity is associated with sudden death and a wide range of morbid conditions such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, angina, chronic obstructive disease, and diabetes mellitus. Recent studies have demonstrated that obese patients who undergo laparoscopy have shorter hospital stays, less postoperative pain, and fewer wound infections when compared with obese patients who undergo laparotomy. Laparoscopy patients also have fewer postoperative ileus and fevers. CONCLUSION: With thorough preparation and careful preoperative evaluation, laparoscopy can be performed safely and is the preferred surgical method in obese patients.","['Lamvu, Georgine', 'Zolnoun, Denniz', 'Boggess, John', 'Steege, John F']","['Lamvu G', 'Zolnoun D', 'Boggess J', 'Steege JF']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Advanced Laparoscopy and Gynecologic Surgery, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. glamvu@med.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Obstet Gynecol,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,0370476,,IM,"['Adipose Tissue', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', '*Laparoscopy', 'Length of Stay', 'Obesity/*epidemiology/*physiopathology', 'Obesity, Morbid/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Physical Examination', 'Pneumoperitoneum, Artificial', 'Respiratory Mechanics', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,2004/09/03 05:00,2004/10/01 05:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0002937804005630 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ajog.2004.05.077 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2004 Aug;191(2):669-74. doi: 10.1016/j.ajog.2004.05.077.,,,,,,,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both the degree and the distribution of excess adipose tissue impact on the risk of hypertension and associated cardiovascular diseases. The mechanisms that may lead to hypertension in obese individuals include increased SNS activity, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, sodium retention, and enhanced vascular reactivity. These abnormalities are interrelated in a complex fashion, making it difficult to determine which, if any, of them is the primary process leading to elevated blood pressure in obese individuals. Nonetheless, the metabolic abnormalities and hypertension diminish with weight loss and chronic exercise, providing a strong rationale for hypocaloric diets and aerobic exercise in the treatment of obesity-related hypertension. Patients who fail to achieve acceptable blood pressure control with diet and exercise therapy require pharmacologic treatment. Of the available antihypertensive agents, calcium entry blockers, ACE inhibitors, and alpha 1-receptor blockers appear to offer good blood pressure control without worsening--and sometimes while improving--the lipid and carbohydrate abnormalities that often occur in obese patients. New drugs developed to ameliorate insulin resistance show promise as antihypertensive agents as well, and may prove to be ideal in reversing multiple cardiovascular risk factors in obese, hypertensive patients.","['Hsueh, W A', 'Buchanan, T A']","['Hsueh WA', 'Buchanan TA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Southern California Medical Center.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Endocrinol Metab Clin North Am,Endocrinology and metabolism clinics of North America,8800104,,IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*complications/physiopathology/therapy', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Obesity/*complications/physiopathology/therapy']",,,,,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Endocrinol Metab Clin North Am. 1994 Jun;23(2):405-27.,['1 P50 44404-04/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,154,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The methods included literature review and correspondence with authors. Since 1947, when Vague described a relation between distribution of body fat and the risk factors for cardiovascular disease, much evidence has suggested that early onset of the obesity, hyperplasia of normal adipocytes, and normal quantities of visceral abdominal fat may be associated with a favorable metabolic response in obese subjects. Analyses in 1973 by Keyes and later by Reuben Andres in 1980 suggested that obesity for some was not a risk factor and might even be an asset. Recently, in the study by Bonora et al of the relation between insulin resistance and the 4 main disorders of the metabolic syndrome in the Bruneck epidemiologic study, a subgroup of obese individuals with a normal metabolic response was evident. In a current study by Brochu et al of an obese metabolically normal subgroup of postmenopausal women, visceral abdominal fat estimated by computed tomography (CT) scan and age of onset were significant variables. The obese, metabolically normal subgroup (OBMN) must be taken into consideration in both clinical and research work. Persons with OBMN and their parents may be wrongly blamed because of the obesity. Attempts at weight loss may be counterproductive. The criteria for selection of obese research subjects may favor inclusion of an OBMN subset, which may invalidate statistical analysis. Findings suggesting the OBMN subset include family members with uncomplicated obesity, early onset of the obesity, fasting plasma insulin within normal range, and normal distribution of the excess fat. Hormonal, genetic studies, and prospective studies will help to clarify the significance and underlying mechanisms of this subset.","['Sims, E A']",['Sims EA'],"['Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism Unit, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington VT, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Metabolism,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,0375267,"['0 (Cholesterol, HDL)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue', 'Body Composition', 'Cholesterol, HDL/blood', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Obesity/classification/diagnosis/*metabolism']",,,,,2001/12/06 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/12/06 10:00'],"['2001/12/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0026-0495(01)61910-3 [pii]', '10.1053/meta.2001.27213 [doi]']",ppublish,Metabolism. 2001 Dec;50(12):1499-504. doi: 10.1053/meta.2001.27213.,,,['Metabolism 2002 Apr;51(4):536'],['Copyright 2001 by W.B.

PATIENTS, SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four sexually active obese premenauposal women were compared with a control group of 27 age-matched healthy volunteers with a normal body mass index (BMI). The obese group was evaluated in three categories according to BMI (kg/m(2)), as group 1 (30-34.9), group 2 (35-39.9) and group 3 (> 40). All women were evaluated with Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). In addition, serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, dehydroepiandrosterone-SO(4) , free testosterone, 17alpha-hydroxyprogestrone, androstenedione, oestradiol, free thyroxine and thyrotropin were determined. RESULTS: The mean FSFI scores were not statistically significant between control and obese patients (P = 0.29). FSD was diagnosed in 50% (32/64) and 41% (11/27) of the patients in the obese and control groups, respectively (P = 0.34). There were no differences between total FSFI and FSFI domain scores among BMI categories. BDI scores were significantly higher in the obese groups than in healthy controls, and negatively correlated with total FSFI and all FSFI domain scores. Among hormonal analyses, only free testosterone levels were negatively correlated with total FSFI scores. CONCLUSION: This study showed that obesity has no significant relationship with FSD, but obese patients were found to be in a more depressive mood than age-matched normal counterparts.","['Kadioglu, Pinar', 'Yetkin, Demet Ozgil', 'Sanli, Oner', 'Yalin, Ayse Serap', 'Onem, Kadir', 'Kadioglu, Ates']","['Kadioglu P', 'Yetkin DO', 'Sanli O', 'Yalin AS', 'Onem K', 'Kadioglu A']","['Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BJU Int,BJU international,100886721,,IM,"['Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Depressive Disorder/*etiology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mental Status Schedule', 'Obesity/*complications/physiopathology/psychology', 'Orgasm', '*Personal Satisfaction', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological/*etiology', 'Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological/*etiology']",,,,,2010/04/17 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/04/17 06:00'],"['2010/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['BJU9348 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1464-410X.2010.09348.x [doi]']",ppublish,BJU Int. 2010 Nov;106(9):1357-61. doi: 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2010.09348.x.,,,,['(c) 2010 THE AUTHORS.

A disease risk-based body mass index classification for Chinese adults was developed and verified by the results of the 2002 China Nationwide Nutrition and Health Survey. Age and gender-specific BMI cut-offs for Chinese children and adolescents aged 7-18 years were also developed. As the first step in the obesity control effort, the public health implications of the prevalence of overweight and obesity were set out and publicized by the government of China. The overweight prevalence in 2002 was 22.8% and for obesity 7.1%, these having increased by 40.7% and 97.2%, respectively, since 1992. In children, dramatic increases in overweight/obesity have occurred with a two- to threefold increase in Beijing and Shanghai between 1985 and 1995; the prevalence of overweight plus obesity in 7- to 12-year-old boys approached 29% in 2000 and in girls 15-17%. The rapid development of overweight/obesity in China will undoubtedly push up the prevalence of chronic disease. The relative risk for adult hypertension and diabetes in the overweight and obese populations was 2-5 in 2002. In adolescents, the relative risk of hypertension in the overweight was 3.3 and in the obese 3.9, with a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors in the obese Chinese children of whom 90.5% had evidence of abdominal obesity. Even the overweight group had 15.8% with abdominal obesity. Based on the population attributable risks of overweight and obesity in 2002 and data on the direct medical costs of hypertension, diabetes, stroke and coronary heart disease, 25% of these comorbidity costs could be attributed to overweight and obesity. As the improvement in linear growth of young children is usually slower than their improvements in weight during the economic development of China, the long-term adult implications of having a problem of 'Stunted obesity' rather than simple obesity in young children are raised. Analysis of the associations between adult obesity with the individuals' fetal and early nutrition highlights the need for further investigation.","['Chen, C M']",['Chen CM'],"['International Life Science Institute Focal Point in China, Beijing, China. chencm@ilsichina.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Obes Rev,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,100897395,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child Development/physiology', 'China/epidemiology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/etiology', 'Humans', 'Obesity/complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Prevalence']",,,,,2008/03/01 09:00,2008/04/26 09:00,['2008/03/01 09:00'],"['2008/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['OBR433 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00433.x [doi]']",ppublish,Obes Rev. 2008 Mar;9 Suppl 1:14-21. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00433.x.,,,,,,,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As obese children are at increased risk of becoming obese adults, early identification of individuals at risk of becoming obese is important for the implementation of preventive measures. In that context, it is important to assess the role of genetic and nongenetic factors in childhood obesity as well as in susceptibility to dietary variations. This paper reviews recent data regarding the prevalence of obesity in childhood as well as the role of genetic factors in phenotypes related to obesity, with emphasis on studies conducted on children, when available. The existence of severe cases of obesity, such as those encountered in Mendelian syndromes of obesity or those caused by mutations in single genes, provides strong evidence for a role of genetic factors in the aetiology of childhood obesity. Furthermore, results from family studies suggest that the maximal heritability of obesity phenotypes ranges from about 30% to 50% and that the major affectors of body fat content, energy intake and energy expenditure are also influenced by genetic factors. Finally, there is increasing evidence that responsiveness to dietary intervention is genetically determined.","['Perusse, L', 'Bouchard, C']","['Perusse L', 'Bouchard C']","['Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Laval University, Ste-Foy, Que, Canada. louis.perusse@kin.msp.ulaval.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ann Med,Annals of medicine,8906388,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*diet therapy/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Med. 1999 Apr;31 Suppl 1:19-25.,,,,,,,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alleles with 21, 25, 35 and 42 repeats have been observed once. The most frequent is VNTR36 allele (38%), followed by alleles 34, 30, 48, and 46 repeats whose frequencies are 20, 9, 8, and 7% respectively. The possible association between alleles of the VNTR3' of the apoB and anthroprometric and lipid variables was examined. Subjects with 50 repeat allele had significantly higher BMI, and subjects with 32 repeat allele had significantly higher HDL-C and ApoAI levels. Our study confirms in the obese subjects, results published in the general litterature, and shows that the apoB has an important role in the metabolism of plasma lipids and most particulary its gene variants.","['Jemaa, R', 'El-Asmi, M', 'Mebazaa, A']","['Jemaa R', 'El-Asmi M', 'Mebazaa A']","['Laboratoire de biochimie, Hopital la Rabta, 1007 Jabbari Tunis, Tunisie.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Biol Clin (Paris),Annales de biologie clinique,2984690R,"['0 (Apolipoprotein A-I)', '0 (Apolipoproteins B)', '0 (Cholesterol, HDL)', '0 (Cholesterol, LDL)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anthropometry', 'Apolipoprotein A-I/blood', 'Apolipoproteins B/*genetics', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cholesterol, HDL/blood', 'Cholesterol, LDL/blood', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Hyperlipidemias/*blood/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Male', 'Minisatellite Repeats/*genetics', 'Obesity/*complications/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Biol Clin (Paris). 2002 Sep-Oct;60(5):559-64.,,,,,,,,,Polymorphisme VNTR3' du gene de l'apolipoproteine B chez les sujets obeses.,,,,,,,,,,,

Obese children had higher perceived difficulty with several activities of daily living, were less engaged in sports, and had lower physical performance than normal-weight or overweight children; on the contrary, they did not differ with regard to time spent in sedentary behaviors. Perceived difficulty in running and hopping negatively predicted sports participation (P < 0.05 and <0.01, resp.), while perceived difficulty in almost all physical activities negatively predicted the 6 MWT, independently of BMI (P < 0.01). Our results indicate that perception of task's difficulty level may reflect an actual difficulty in obese children.

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between BA maturation and insulin levels in obese children. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study of 93 prepubertal obese children, anthropometric data and hormonal values were measured. Subjects were divided into 2 groups based on the difference between BA and chronological age (CA) (noted as BA-CA). RESULTS: The study population included 39 (41.9%) males and 54 (58.1%) females with a mean age of 7.4+/-1.5 years. The advanced bone age group defined as BA-CA>1 year (n=44) had significantly higher HOMA-IR and fasting insulin levels, and lower quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). BA-CA was significantly correlated with fasting insulin (r=0.255, P=0.014), HOMA-IR (r=0.230, P=0.027), and QUICKI (r=- 0.301, P=0.003). Also, height SDS was significantly associated with DeltaBA-CA (r=0.417, P<0.001). In the multiple regression analysis, HOMA-IR was identified as a significant independent predictor of BA-CA. CONCLUSION: Bone age is more advanced in obese children with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. These findings suggest that insulin may affect skeletal maturation.","['Lee, H S', 'Shim, Y S', 'Jeong, H R', 'Kwon, E B', 'Hwang, J S']","['Lee HS', 'Shim YS', 'Jeong HR', 'Kwon EB', 'Hwang JS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Ajou University Hospital, Suwon, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hallym University School of Medicine, Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital, Dongtan, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Ajou University Hospital, Suwon, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Ajou University Hospital, Suwon, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Ajou University Hospital, Suwon, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes,"Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",9505926,,IM,"['*Age Determination by Skeleton', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Insulin Resistance', 'Male', 'Obesity/*metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,2015/11/26 06:00,2016/09/08 06:00,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0035-1559795 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes. 2015 Nov;123(10):604-7. doi: 10.1055/s-0035-1559795.

Genetic variability predisposes an individual to tendency or resistance to increase body weight in obesogenic environment. Polygenic type of inheritance is responsible in most of obese individuals. However, an intensive research of the past 20 years has led to an identification of several genes causing monogenic forms of obesity. To date, several monogenic genes (leptin, leptin receptor, prohormon convertase 1, proopiomelanocortin, melanocortin 4 receptor, single-minded homolog 1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2) that are either involved in the neuronal differentiation of the paraventricular nucleus or in the leptin-melanocortin pathway are known to cause obesity. Mutation carriers apart from severe early onset obesity manifest with additional phenotypic characteristics as adrenal insufficiency, impaired immunity and impaired fertility.

Less is known about the impact of obesity on functional health status and subjective well-being. METHODS: We examined health-related quality of life (HRQL), measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), and clinical characteristics of 312 consecutive persons seeking outpatient treatment for obesity at a university-based weight management center. SF-36 scores were adjusted for sociodemographic factors and various comorbidities, including depression, to better estimate the effect of obesity on HRQL. Health-related quality of life of the obese patients was then compared with that of the general population and with a sample of patients who have other chronic medical conditions. RESULTS: Compared with general population norms, participants who had a mean body-mass index (BMI) of 38.1 reported significantly lower scores (i.e., more impairment) on all eight quality-of-life domains, especially bodily pain and vitality. The morbidly obese (mean BMI, 48.7) reported significantly worse physical, social, and role functioning, worse perceived general health, and greater bodily pain than did either the mildly (mean BMI, 29.2) or moderately to severely obese (mean BMI, 34.5). The obese also reported significantly greater disability due to bodily pain than did patients with other chronic medical conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity profoundly affects quality of life. Bodily pain is a prevalent problem among obese persons seeking weight loss and may be an important consideration in the treatment of this population.","['Fontaine, K R', 'Cheskin, L J', 'Barofsky, I']","['Fontaine KR', 'Cheskin LJ', 'Barofsky I']","['Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21224, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Fam Pract,The Journal of family practice,7502590,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/classification/*complications/physiopathology/therapy', 'Outpatient Clinics, Hospital', 'Pain/classification/*etiology', '*Quality of Life', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'United States']",,,,,1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Fam Pract. 1996 Sep;43(3):265-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many large epidemiological studies have demonstrated associations between body mass index and blood pressure, and there is evidence to suggest that obesity is a causal factor in the development of hypertension in obese individuals. Consequently, all hypertension management guidelines consider weight reduction as a first step in the management of increased blood pressure in obese individuals. Weight reduction may be achieved by behaviour modification, diet and exercise, or by the use of anti-obesity medications. However, the long-term outcomes of weight management programmes for obesity are generally poor, and most hypertensive patients will require antihypertensive drug treatment. Some classes of antihypertensive agents may have potentially unwanted effects on some of the metabolic and haemodynamic abnormalities that link obesity and hypertension, yet most hypertension guidelines fail to provide specific advice on the pharmacological management of obese patients. This may be because there are currently no studies examining the efficacy of specific antihypertensive agents in reducing mortality in obese hypertensive patients. This paper reviews the theoretical reasons for the differential use of the major classes of antihypertensive agents in the pharmacological management of obesity-related hypertension and also considers the potential role of anti-obesity agents.","['Sharma, A M', 'Pischon, T', 'Engeli, S', 'Scholze, J']","['Sharma AM', 'Pischon T', 'Engeli S', 'Scholze J']","['Franz-Volhard Klinik, Max-Delbruck Centre for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany. sharma@fvk-berlin.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Hypertens,Journal of hypertension,8306882,['0 (Antihypertensive Agents)'],IM,"['Antihypertensive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Obesity/*complications/therapy']",,,,,2001/05/02 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/05/02 10:00'],"['2001/05/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004872-200104000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hypertens. 2001 Apr;19(4):667-74. doi: 10.1097/00004872-200104000-00001.,,,,,,,95,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main aim was to evaluate the effect of PEEP on ICP in SBI patients with mechanical ventilation according to obesity status. METHODS: SBI patients admitted to the ICU with mechanical ventilation between 2014 and 2015 were included. Demographic, hemodynamic, arterial blood gas, and ventilator data at the time of the paired PEEP and ICP observations were recorded and compared between obese (body mass index >/= 30 kg/m(2)) and non-obese SBI patients. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used to assess the relationship between PEEP and ICP in obese and non-obese SBI patients, respectively. RESULTS: Six hundred twenty-seven SBI patients were included, 407 (65%) non-obese and 220 (35%) obese patients. A total of 30,415 paired PEEP and ICP observations were recorded in these patients, 19,566 (64.3%) for non-obese and 10,849 (35.7%) for obese. In the multivariable analysis, a statistically significant relationship between PEEP and ICP was found in obese SBI patients, but not in non-obese ones. For every cmH(2)O increase in PEEP, there was a 0.19 mmHg increase in ICP (95% CI [0.05, 0.33], P = 0.007) and a 0.15 mmHg decrease in CPP (95% CI [-0.29, -0.01], P = 0.036) in obese SBI patients after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that, contrary to non-obese SBI patients, the application of PEEP may produce an increase in ICP in obese SBI patients. However, the effect was modest and may be clinically inconsequential.","['Zhou, Dawei', 'Li, Tong', 'Fei, Shuyang', 'Wang, Chao', 'Lv, Yi']","['Zhou D', 'Li T', 'Fei S', 'Wang C', 'Lv Y']","['Department of Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. tricumd@126.com.', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",England,BMC Anesthesiol,BMC anesthesiology,100968535,,IM,"['Humans', '*Intracranial Pressure', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration/methods', 'Hemodynamics', '*Brain Injuries', 'Obesity/complications/therapy']",PMC9753360,['NOTNLM'],"['Cerebral perfusion pressure', 'Intracranial pressure', 'Obesity', 'Positive end-expiratory pressure', 'Severe brain injury']",['None of the authors has declared a conflict of interest.'],2022/12/16 06:00,2022/12/20 06:00,['2022/12/15 23:45'],"['2022/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2022/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/12/15 23:45 [entrez]', '2022/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12871-022-01934-9 [pii]', '1934 [pii]', '10.1186/s12871-022-01934-9 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Anesthesiol. 2022 Dec 15;22(1):388. doi: 10.1186/s12871-022-01934-9.,,20221215,,['(c) 2022.

Using high throughput sequencing of 16SrRNA bacterial gene and diverse bioinformatics tools, we observed that the gut microbiota of obese and overweight individuals differs qualitatively and quantitatively from that from their lean counterparts. The comparison of the gut microbiota composition in obese subjects from Argentina, US and UK showed that the beta diversity significantly differs among the three countries, indicating that obesity-associated microbiota composition changes according to the geographical origin of the individuals. Moreover, four distinct microbiotypes were identified in obese individuals, whose prevalence and metabolic pathway signature differed according to the country, indicating that obesity associated dysbiosis would comprise several structures. In summary, identification of distinct taxonomic signatures associated with obesity might be a novel promising tool to stratify patients based on their microbiome configuration to design strategies for managing obesity.","['Pesoa, Susana A', 'Portela, Nestor', 'Fernandez, Eduardo', 'Elbarcha, Osvaldo', 'Gotteland, Martin', 'Magne, Fabien']","['Pesoa SA', 'Portela N', 'Fernandez E', 'Elbarcha O', 'Gotteland M', 'Magne F']","['Department of Molecular Diagnosis, LACE Laboratories, Avda Velez Sarsfield 528, Cordoba, Argentina. susana.pesoa@laboratoriolace.com.ar.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnosis, LACE Laboratories, Avda Velez Sarsfield 528, Cordoba, Argentina.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnosis, LACE Laboratories, Avda Velez Sarsfield 528, Cordoba, Argentina.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnosis, LACE Laboratories, Avda Velez Sarsfield 528, Cordoba, Argentina.', 'Department of Nutrition, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology (INTA), University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Microbiology and Mycology Program, Biomedical Sciences Institute (ICBM), School of Medicine, University of Chile, Av.

Obesity causes a decline in life expectancy due to its associated metabolic and cardiovascular comorbid disorders. Therefore, it will become more important to distinguish obese individuals at high risk for obesity-related metabolic diseases from those who are metabolically 'healthy'. This review focuses on recent evidence suggesting that normal adipose tissue function contributes to the healthy obese phenotype. RECENT FINDINGS: The majority of individuals with obesity develop insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, gout, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. However, approximately 10-25% of obese individuals are metabolically healthy most likely due to preserved insulin sensitivity. Recent studies suggest that inflammation of visceral adipose tissue, ectopic fat deposition and adipose tissue dysfunction mediate insulin resistance in human obesity independently of total body fat mass. This suggests that mechanisms beyond a positive caloric balance such as inflammation and adipokine release determine the pathological metabolic consequences in patients with obesity. SUMMARY: Recommendations for obesity treatment should distinguish the metabolically 'healthy' from 'unhealthy' obese phenotype to identify early the obese person who will benefit the most from losing weight. In addition, novel antiobesity treatment strategies targeting adipose tissue dysfunction are needed.","['Bluher, Matthias']",['Bluher M'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany. bluma@medizin.uni-leipzig.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Lipidol,Current opinion in lipidology,9010000,,IM,"['Behavior', 'Environment', '*Health', 'Humans', 'Intra-Abdominal Fat/metabolism', 'Obesity/*metabolism/*physiopathology']",,,,,2009/11/17 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/11/17 06:00'],"['2009/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOL.0b013e3283346ccc [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Lipidol. 2010 Feb;21(1):38-43. doi: 10.1097/MOL.0b013e3283346ccc.,"['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The paper deals with observation study of the group of obese patients recruited and treated in Bialystok's Clinical Center for Cardiology and Body Mass Reduction. The authors summarize 12 months of clinical observation (as it was initially planned) of the two groups of obese women, taking part in the special body mass reduction program; Group I - 81 women in perimenopausal and menopausal age, Group II - 107 women in 18-44 years of age. The proposed treatment contained diet, physical exercises, psychological support and pharmacotherapy. RESULTS: The positive reaction for the treatment of obesity was less visible in obese women in perimenopausal and menopausal age, than in the group of obese women in 18-44 years of age (change of BMI in the group of younger women was -3.44 kg/m2 vs. -2.65 kg/m2 in older women). As it was observed, the weaker reaction for the proposed treatment in the group of older women, was not related to lower BMR, than in the group of younger obese women. Provisional result shows that use of HRT (Hormonal Replace Therapy) may probably result in better response of body mass reduction in perimenopausal and menopausal women. CONCLUSION: The high dropout of the patients included into the study does not allow to formulate unequivocal conclusions but it seems that body mass reduction program for women in perimenopausal and menopausal age should concentrate on building the motivation of the patients, HRT may play some role in improvement of effectiveness of such program but this should be confirmed by further studies.","['Ostrowska, L', 'Lech, M M']","['Ostrowska L', 'Lech MM']","['Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Medical University of Bialystok, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Czech Republic,Cent Eur J Public Health,Central European journal of public health,9417324,['0 (Anti-Obesity Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Obesity Agents/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Energy Intake', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Menopause', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/drug therapy/physiopathology/*therapy', '*Perimenopause', 'Poland']",,,,,2005/04/30 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/04/30 09:00'],"['2005/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cent Eur J Public Health. 2005 Mar;13(1):40-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors investigated the effect of a four-week therapy of obese patients by a low energy protein diet with an energy value of 1560 kJ on the resting metabolic rate (RMR), the serum concentration of thyroid hormones and TSH and on the Achilles tendon reflex time. Four weeks' treatment with a low energy protein diet caused a significant drop of the energy output at rest in the control group of obese men (by 17.5%), as well as in the control group of obese women (by 16.9 per cent). In the group of obese women who were given during the last two weeks of treatment depot methyl xanthine derivative, Euphilline (Byk Gulden), the energy output at rest did not decline as a result of dietetic treatment and the decline of the BMI was significantly higher than in the control group of obese women, although the two groups did not differ in the initial BMI, mean age and the degree of physical activity during treatment. With the exception of the control group of men where the serum triiodothyronine level declined, in the investigated obese subjects no significant changes of the investigated thyroid function parameters were recorded. The syndrome of low T3 thus does not participate in a substantial way in the drop of the metabolism at rest during treatment with a low energy protein diet, obviously due to the intake of 50 g carbohydrate per day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Hainer, V', 'Kunesova, M', 'Stich, V', 'Stukavec, V', 'Wernischova, V', 'Hrabak, P']","['Hainer V', 'Kunesova M', 'Stich V', 'Stukavec V', 'Wernischova V', 'Hrabak P']","['IV. interni katedra I. lekarske fakulty Univerzity Karlovy, Praha.']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,['27Y3KJK423 (Aminophylline)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aminophylline/*therapeutic use', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*diet therapy/drug therapy/metabolism']",,,,,1990/07/20 00:00,1990/07/20 00:01,['1990/07/20 00:00'],"['1990/07/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/20 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 1990 Jul 20;129(29):907-10.,,,,,,,,,Vliv euphyllinu na energetickou uspornost obeznich pacientu pri lecbe redukcni dietou.,,,,,,,,,,,

To help patients avoid these problems, physiotherapists increasingly engage in lifestyle programs specialized in weight loss. OBJECTIVE: To explore how physiotherapists' encounters with patients diagnosed as ""obese"" acquire significance for their development as clinicians. METHOD: The material draws on semi-structured interviews with eight physiotherapists. We conducted a thematic analysis inspired by van Manen's hermeneutic-phenomenological approach combined with Kvale and Brinkman's critical approach. FINDINGS: The analysis identified the following four themes: 1) Striving to find one's own style of communication; 2) Relating to bodily discrepancies; 3) Developing clinical competence through bodily encounters; and 4) Gaining insight into the dilemmas of group-based lifestyle programs. Taken together, our findings highlight bodily encounters between patients and physiotherapists as an invaluable source of insight. Such insight can shape physiotherapists' development as clinicians inspiring them to develop their unique ways of communicating so that patients diagnosed as obese can feel empowerment rather than failure and shame. At the same time, our findings point to the need of critically reflecting on ones' own approach entering a double role of both controller and supporter. As such, our findings complicate and extend previous work on stigma and shame. CONCLUSION: Our research leads us to conclude that more emphasis on critical thinking in physiotherapy is necessary. We suggest that this should be given more priority in research, education, as well as in clinical practice.","['Groven, Karen Synne', 'Heggen, Kristin']","['Groven KS', 'Heggen K']","['a Institute of Health and Society, Faculty of Medicine , University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway.', 'b Department of Health and society , Oslo University College , Norway.', 'a Institute of Health and Society, Faculty of Medicine , University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Physiother Theory Pract,Physiotherapy theory and practice,9015520,,IM,"['*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Clinical Competence', '*Communication', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Obesity/diagnosis/physiopathology/psychology/*therapy', 'Physical Therapists/*psychology', '*Professional Role', '*Professional-Patient Relations', 'Qualitative Research', '*Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Weight Loss']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Embodyment', 'experience', 'lifestyle program', 'obesity', 'professional development']",,2017/11/10 06:00,2018/09/05 06:00,['2017/11/10 06:00'],"['2017/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09593985.2017.1400140 [doi]'],ppublish,Physiother Theory Pract. 2018 May;34(5):346-358. doi: 10.1080/09593985.2017.1400140.

Our main hypothesis was that obese children would obtain lower overall math scores than their non-obese peers. METHODS: Participants of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth comprised the sample for our analysis (n = 4 664). Obesity was based on mother-reported height and weight and IOTF age- and sex-specific body mass index cut-offs, and was assessed when the cohort was aged 2-5 years and 8-11 years. Children were classified as 'never obese', 'grew out of obesity', 'developed obesity' or 'always obese', depending on their obesity status at these two time points. The outcome was performance on a standardized math test that was administered when the cohort was aged 8-11 years. Statistical analysis was conducted using multivariate linear regression methods. RESULTS: Children who 'grew out of obesity' scored on average 11 points higher on the math test (p<0.0001) than children who were 'never obese.' Children who were 'always obese' and those that 'developed obesity' performed no differently on the math test than children who were 'never obese'. No interactions between sex and obesity status were found. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood obesity in this study did not lead to poor math performance. Being obese in the pre-school years and normal weight in primary school, however, was associated with improved math performance. This finding points to a potential nutritional window for early child development.","['Carter, Megan Ann', 'Dubois, Lise', 'Ramsay, Tim']","['Carter MA', 'Dubois L', 'Ramsay T']","['Department of Epidemiology and Community Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada. mcart037@uottawa.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Pediatr Obes,International journal of pediatric obesity : IJPO : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,101256330,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intelligence', 'Linear Models', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', '*Mathematics', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity/*epidemiology/ethnology/*psychology', 'Prospective Studies']",,,,,2010/01/19 06:00,2011/01/19 06:00,['2010/01/19 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/17477160903496995 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Pediatr Obes. 2010 Oct;5(5):412-9. doi: 10.3109/17477160903496995.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to explore barriers to effective weight management in obese patients with knee osteoarthritis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire study was performed in an elective out-patient setting and on an orthopaedic ward on patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or over and knee osteoarthritis. RESULTS: Of 47 patients approached, 45 agreed to participate. Forty of 45 patients (89%) had tried to lose weight at some point, 35 of 40 (87.5%) by adjusting their diet. Forty of 45 (89%) patients considered lack of motivation to be the greatest barrier to weight loss and only 13 of 45 (28%) pain in the knee. Patients with a BMI of less than 40 kg/m2 expressed a preference for dietary advice to help with weight loss, compared with those with a BMI of over 40 kg/m2 who expressed a preference for an NHS or other support group. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is a significant problem for many patients with knee osteoarthritis. Attendance at an orthopaedic clinic is an opportunity to address obesity, by providing information about diet and possibly support groups for morbidly obese patients. Patients may be motivated to lose weight to improve their symptoms.","['Howarth, David', 'Inman, Dominic', 'Lingard, Elizabeth', 'McCaskie, Andrew', 'Gerrand, Craig']","['Howarth D', 'Inman D', 'Lingard E', 'McCaskie A', 'Gerrand C']","['Department of Orthopaedics, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. d.c.howarth@newcastle.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann R Coll Surg Engl,Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,7506860,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Attitude to Health', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Obesity/*complications/physiopathology/psychology/therapy', 'Osteoarthritis, Knee/*etiology/physiopathology', '*Weight Loss']",PMC3025198,,,,2010/04/14 06:00,2010/06/17 06:00,['2010/04/14 06:00'],"['2010/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['02 [pii]', '10.1308/003588410X12628812458653 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann R Coll Surg Engl. 2010 May;92(4):338-40. doi: 10.1308/003588410X12628812458653.,,,,,,,,['Ann R Coll Surg Engl. 2010 Sep;92(6):537.

OBJECTIVE: to determine the effects of a program of physical exercise interval on the anthropometric profile of the morbidly obese and obese with comorbidities candidates to bariatric surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: three men and twenty-five women between 18 and 60 years old candidates to bariatric surgery, with morbid obesity (n = 16) or obese and comorbidities (type-II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance) (n = 12), they were subjected to a program of physical exercise with interval overload of three months duration (36 sessions). Before and 72 hours after the last intervention session was evaluated on fasting (>/= 12 hours): body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist contour (WC) and contour hip. RESULTS: the average age corresponds to 36.96 years, prior to intervention the weight had an average of 102.66 +/- 15.96 kg, BMI of 40.84 +/- 4.94, the WC 114.22 +/- 10.35 cm and the contour hip 126.84 +/- 10.65 cm. After twelve weeks of intervention showed significant decreases in weight variables (p = 0.000), BMI (p = 0.001), WC (p = 0.000) and hip contour (0.000). CONCLUSIONS: twelve weeks of interval exercise improved preoperative anthropometric conditions, without presenting risks in health and with high adherence to the program, which is why it may be recommended for this type of treatment.","['Delgado Floody, Pedro', 'Jerez Mayorga, Daniel', 'Caamano Navarrete, Felipe', 'Osorio Poblete, Aldo', 'Thuillier Lepeley, Nicole', 'Alarcon Hormazabal, Manuel']","['Delgado Floody P', 'Jerez Mayorga D', 'Caamano Navarrete F', 'Osorio Poblete A', 'Thuillier Lepeley N', 'Alarcon Hormazabal M']","['Programa de Tratamiento Integral de la Obesidad Morbida, Universidad Santo Tomas, Temuco.

STUDY DESIGN: Patients equal to and greater than 18 years old treated between 1/1/2018 and 12/31/2020 were included. Demographics, BMI, comorbidities, and outcomes (hospital-LOS, ICU-LOS, blood products used, and mortality) were compared between 2 groups: obese (BMI >/=30) vs non-obese (BMI <30). RESULTS: Of the 4192 patients identified, 3821 met the inclusion criteria; 3019 patients had a BMI <30, and 802 had a BMI >/=30. There was a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to gender (females: 57% vs 47%, P < .0001) and age (median: 80 [IQR: 63-88] vs 69 [IQR: 55-81], P < .0001).

RESULTS: Intraclass correlations suggested similarity between obese and nonobese siblings in maternal control over feeding. Mothers perceived differences between their obese and nonobese children's eating regulation. Mothers' weight status was positively associated with disinhibition of their own eating as well as concern about both their obese and nonobese children's weight and health.

To this end, 73 nurses from an acute care hospital completed the Weight Control/Blame Subscale of the Antifat Attitudes Test and reported on their perception of discrimination in, and available resources for, the provision of care to obese patients. Nurses endorsing stronger beliefs that weight lies under individual control were more likely to report discrimination of obese patients in clinical practice. Weight bias, higher care intensity, and lack of necessary resources were the main reasons reported for perceived weight discrimination. Our results support theories placing internal attribution of overweight and conflict over resources at the origin of weight stigma and call for appropriate interventions to improve nurses' work environment and reduce their weight bias.","['Tanneberger, Anne', 'Ciupitu-Plath, Cristina']","['Tanneberger A', 'Ciupitu-Plath C']","['1 Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany.', '1 Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Nurs Res,Clinical nursing research,9208508,,,"['Adult', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nurses/*psychology', '*Obesity/nursing/psychology', '*Social Stigma']",,['NOTNLM'],"['nursing', 'obesity', 'obesity stigma', 'weight bias', 'weight controllability']",,2017/01/06 06:00,2019/03/15 06:00,['2017/01/06 06:00'],"['2017/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1054773816687443 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Nurs Res. 2018 May;27(4):414-432. doi: 10.1177/1054773816687443.

Previous experiments, however, have not provided an opportunity for obese mice to exhibit compensatory thermoregulatory behaviors which might reinstate normal body temperature. In the present experiment, adult obese and lean (+/?) mice were tested at room temperature (25 degrees C) on a copper bar, thermal gradient to determine what temperatures they would select and what effect their selection would have on their TcS. The data revealed that ob/obs were more frequently observed within 25-35 degrees C locales than were lean controls, which spent more time in the below-25 degrees C zone (p less than 0.005). Ob/obs also raised their TcS to pretest values of leans' TcS, although ob/obs' TcS remained significantly lower than those of leans at the conclusion of testing. These data suggest that the hypothermia exhibited by the ob/ob may reflect both the absence of the opportunity to behaviorally thermoregulate and a genetic defect in thermogenesis.","['Wilson, L M', 'Sinha, H L']","['Wilson LM', 'Sinha HL']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Physiol Behav,Physiology & behavior,0151504,,IM,"['Animals', '*Body Temperature Regulation', 'Choice Behavior', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Obese', 'Obesity/genetics/*physiopathology/psychology', 'Temperature']",,,,,1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0031-9384(85)90138-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0031-9384(85)90138-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Physiol Behav. 1985 Oct;35(4):545-8. doi: 10.1016/0031-9384(85)90138-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: T cells are isolated from the blood of the control and obese women with hypertension the University Hospital of Tlemcen (Algeria), these cells are incubated in the presence of a synthetic mixture of PUFA to 30muM (DHA/EPA/LA) and stimulated by mitogens for 48hours. The cells are counted and used to assess intracellular oxidative status. The biochemical parameters are determined by the use of plasma. RESULTS: In obese women with hypertension, a significant increase in plasma levels of (glucose, uric acid, creatinine, urea, total cholesterol and triglycerides) compared to controls. In addition, decreased cell proliferation, basal or stimulated by Con A was observed in obese women with hypertension compared with controls. The mixture of PUFA to 30muM reduced lymphoproliferation as well in obese women with hypertension than in controls. The rates in malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl lymphocytes are elevated in hypertensive obese women. PUFA supplementation to 30muM seems correct this redox status in hypertensive obese since rates in protein carbonyl, are similar to those of controls. CONCLUSION: The mixture of PUFA (n-3 and n-6) can modulate the activity of T lymphocyte proliferation and correct the intracellular redox status in hypertensive obese women.","['Baba Ahmed, F Z', 'Bouanane, S', 'Merzouk, H', 'Soufi, N']","['Baba Ahmed FZ', 'Bouanane S', 'Merzouk H', 'Soufi N']","['Laboratoire de physiologie, physiopathologie et biochimie de la nutrition PPABIONUT, departement de biologie, faculte SNVTU, universite de Tlemcen, Rocade 2, BP 119, Tlemcen, Algerie.

Hence, surgeons and anaesthetists will care for an increasing number of obese patients in the foreseeable future, and should be prepared to provide optimal management for these individuals. This review provides an update of recent evidence regarding perioperative strategies for obese patients. METHODS: A search for papers on the perioperative care of obese patients (English language only) was performed in July 2019 using the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library electronic databases. The review focused on the results of RCTs, although observational studies, meta-analyses, reviews, guidelines and other reports discussing the perioperative care of obese patients were also considered. When data from obese patients were not available, relevant data from non-obese populations were used. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Obese patients require comprehensive preoperative evaluation. Experienced medical teams, appropriate equipment and monitoring, careful anaesthetic management, and an adequate perioperative ventilation strategy may improve postoperative outcomes. Additional perioperative precautions are necessary in patients with severe morbid obesity, metabolic syndrome, untreated or severe obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, or obesity hypoventilation syndrome; patients receiving home ventilatory support or postoperative opioid therapy; and obese patients undergoing open operations, long procedures or revisional surgery.","['Carron, M', 'Safaee Fakhr, B', 'Ieppariello, G', 'Foletto, M']","['Carron M', 'Safaee Fakhr B', 'Ieppariello G', 'Foletto M']","['Department of Medicine - DIMED, Section of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine - DIMED, Section of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine - DIMED, Section of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical, Oncological and Gastroenterological Sciences, Section of Surgery, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Surg,The British journal of surgery,0372553,,IM,"['Airway Management', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*complications/surgery', 'Patient Positioning', '*Perioperative Care/methods', 'Surgical Procedures, Operative']",,,,,2020/01/07 06:00,2020/07/21 06:00,['2020/01/07 06:00'],"['2019/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bjs.11447 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Surg. 2020 Jan;107(2):e39-e55. doi: 10.1002/bjs.11447.,,,,['(c) 2020 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of owner-reported obesity in veterinary-registered horses and ponies in GB, and identify factors associated with obesity. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey of horse/pony owners in GB was undertaken using a postal questionnaire. METHODS: Thirty veterinary practices randomly selected horse/pony owners to complete a self-administered postal questionnaire. Owners estimated body condition score using a modified Carroll and Huntington method (1-6 scale), and animals were classified as obese if they were scored as either 5 (fat) or 6 (very fat). Factors associated with obesity were assessed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Prevalence of obesity was 31.2% (n = 247/792; 95% confidence interval [CI] 27.9-34.2%). Factors associated with increased odds of obesity were breed (P<0.001), ease of maintaining weight (P<0.001) and primary use (P = 0.002). Compared to Thoroughbreds, draught-type (odds ratio [OR] 7.3; 95% CI 3.1-17.1), cob-type (OR 5.6; 95% CI 2.5-12.5), native (OR 3.2; 95% CI 1.8-5.78) and Welsh breeds (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.9-6.2) were more likely to be obese. Animals described as 'good doers' were more likely to be obese than those described as readily maintaining normal weight (OR 3.7; 95% CI 2.6-5.3). Compared to competition animals, animals used for pleasure riding (OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.4-4.4) and nonridden animals (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.5-5.5) were more likely to be obese. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of at-risk breeds and other horse- and management-level risk factors for obesity will enable optimal targeting of owner education regarding management strategies to reduce the frequency of equine obesity.","['Robin, C A', 'Ireland, J L', 'Wylie, C E', 'Collins, S N', 'Verheyen, K L P', 'Newton, J R']","['Robin CA', 'Ireland JL', 'Wylie CE', 'Collins SN', 'Verheyen KL', 'Newton JR']","['Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Department, Animal Health Trust, Newmarket, Suffolk, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Equine Vet J,Equine veterinary journal,0173320,,IM,"['Animal Husbandry', 'Animals', 'Data Collection', 'Horse Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Horses', 'Obesity/epidemiology/etiology/*veterinary', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,['NOTNLM'],"['condition score', 'horse', 'obese', 'risk factors', 'weight']",,2014/04/17 06:00,2015/10/06 06:00,['2014/04/17 06:00'],"['2013/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/evj.12275 [doi]'],ppublish,Equine Vet J. 2015 Mar;47(2):196-201. doi: 10.1111/evj.12275.

Obesity causes many non-communicable diseases. Options to control obesity are in search. Aim: To assess the outcome of 3 months follow-up period, after 14 weeks yoga intervention, for body composition and sleep quality parameters on obese male in urban setting. Materials and methods Design: Parallel group RCT (randomized controlled trial) on obese male. The two groups were yoga and control groups, with yoga (n = 37, age 40.03 +/- 8.74), control (n = 35, age 42.20 +/- 12.06). The IAYT (integrated approach of yoga therapy) training was given to yoga group for 14 weeks, and the unsupervised yoga practice was continued by the subjects at their home, for further 3 months. Training was 1.5 hour daily for 5 days in a week, which included the IAYT module of Suryanamaskara Asana Pranayama and relaxation. No yoga activity but walking etc. for the same time, was given to control group. Body composition parameters were assessed through BIA (bioelectrical impedance) method using InBody R 20 model. The sleep quality was assessed using PSQI (Pittsburgh sleep quality index). Within group and between group analysis were performed, using SPSS version 21. The correlation analysis was carried out on the difference in pre follow-up values. Results During the follow-up period within the group, the body composition parameters improved and the parameters of quality of sleep showed trends of improvement. Also some of the gain obtained during 14 weeks intervention was lost during follow-up period. Conclusions The changes observed may indicate the long-term benefits of yoga practice for control of obesity in urban setting for males.","['Rshikesan, P B', 'Subramanya, Pailoor', 'Nidhi, Ram']","['Rshikesan PB', 'Subramanya P', 'Nidhi R']","['Department of Yoga and life Sciences, Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Yoga and life Sciences, Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Yoga and life Sciences, Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Germany,J Complement Integr Med,Journal of complementary & integrative medicine,101313855,,IM,"['Adult', 'Body Composition', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Meditation', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*physiopathology/psychology/*therapy', 'Relaxation', 'Sleep', '*Yoga']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BMI (body mass index)', 'PSQI', 'body composition', 'sleep', 'yoga']",,2018/10/24 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2016/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['jcim-2016-0077 [pii]', '10.1515/jcim-2016-0077 [doi]']",epublish,J Complement Integr Med. 2018 Oct 20;15(4). doi: 10.1515/jcim-2016-0077.,,20181020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elevated oxidative stress contributes to the development of such obesity-related diseases as dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Levels of the endogenous antioxidants paraoxonase and arylesterase have been shown to decrease in such diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not changes in lifestyle and metformin therapy would affect serum paraoxonase and arylesterase levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed with 25 overweight, 26 obese and 25 morbidly obese patients aged 6-15 years as well as 27 healthy children. Serum paraoxonase (PON1) and arylesterase (ARE) activity levels and total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density protein, high-density protein, very low-density protein, glucose, aspartate amino transferase and alanine amino transferase levels were measured. Enrolled patients were assessed at initial presentation and again at 6 months. No procedure was performed in the control group, while the overweight, obese and morbidly obese groups were recommended diet and exercise and given metformin therapy (insulin-resistant subjects only). RESULTS: Serum PON1 activity levels in patients with metabolic syndrome were significantly lower than those in individuals without metabolic syndrome (p<0.05), while lipid concentrations were significantly higher (p<0.05).

Condensation of presumptive adipocyte clusters was more apparent in Ossabaw sections than in cross-bred (lean) sections at 90 and 110 days gestation. Enzyme and lipid histochemistry showed fat cell cluster development to be largely independent of fetal strain (Ossabaw vs crossbred). However, adipocytes in Ossabaw fetuses were larger (110 days) and more reactive for esterase activity (all three ages) than were adipocytes from crossbred fetuses. Fetuses from USDA-obese dams had larger fat cell diameters (P less than 0.01), a higher percentage of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) positive cells than did fetuses from USDA-lean dams. Perirenal fat pad weights, percent depot lipid, percentages of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) positive cells were independent of fetal strain (USDA, lean vs obese). Fat cell cluster development was independent of fetal strain but large cellular condensations of presumptive cells were only present in sections from lean fetuses. Immature capillary beds (devoid of adipocytes) were demonstrable in lean sections but were not observed in obese sections. Morphological and histochemical results from both studies provide no evidence for brown adipocyte-like cells in fetal perirenal tissues.","['Hausman, G J', 'Thomas, G B']","['Hausman GJ', 'Thomas GB']","['Animal Physiology Research Unit, R.

We aimed to describe the blood lymphocyte profiles of obese children and to search for associations with clinical phenotypes. METHODS: Main blood lymphocyte subpopulations were analyzed in 159 children with CO and 34 with SO in a retrospective cohort. Phenotypes included obesity history, body mass index (BMI) Z score, percentage fat mass, and inflammatory parameters. Correlations were performed between phenotypes and circulating lymphocyte profiles. RESULTS: Children with SO had a higher BMI Z score (5.5 +/- 1.7 SD) than children with CO (4.7 +/- 0.9 SD; p = 0.01). Significant differences were found for lymphocyte counts, including a higher percentage of CD19(+) B cells (SO = 20.1 +/- 6.7 vs. CO = 17.1 +/- 6.1%, p = 0.03), despite lower absolute numbers (SO = 0.57 +/- 0.20 vs. CO = 0.63 +/- 1.9 g/L, p < 0.01). However, no difference in the lymphocyte profile was found between children with SO and those with the most severe CO (BMI Z score >/= 4.7 SD). CONCLUSION: Children with SO have altered blood lymphocyte profiles with increased prevalence of CD19(+) B cells, which is closely linked to the degree of obesity severity and inflammatory markers.","['Dieme, A', 'Andre, S', 'Lapillonne, H', 'Tounian, P', 'Clement, K', 'Dubern, B']","['Dieme A', 'Andre S', 'Lapillonne H', 'Tounian P', 'Clement K', 'Dubern B']","[""Armand-Trousseau Children's Hospital, Pediatric Nutrition and Gastroenterology Department, Paris, France."", 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and Obesities, Systemic Approaches, Nutriomics, Paris, France.', ""Armand-Trousseau Children's Hospital, Biological Hematology Department, Paris, France."", ""Armand-Trousseau Children's Hospital, Pediatric Nutrition and Gastroenterology Department, Paris, France."", 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and Obesities, Systemic Approaches, Nutriomics, Paris, France; Hopital Universitaire Pitie Salpetriere, Nutrition Department, Paris, France.', ""Armand-Trousseau Children's Hospital, Pediatric Nutrition and Gastroenterology Department, Paris, France; Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Nutrition and Obesities, Systemic Approaches, Nutriomics, Paris, France.

Estimates of sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and efficiency were used to describe the relative validity of the anthropometric indicators, and the nature of misclassification resulting when the indicators were applied. The indicators were characterized generally by low levels of sensitivity and corresponding high rates of false negatives, i.e. truly obese youths who were considered not obese by the indicators. Although indicators had high specificities, there were significant differences among indicators. The general pattern of high specificity is desirable, given the nature of obesity in youths.

However, the impact of body fat distribution on energy metabolism is not clear. SUBJECTS: One hundred fifteen non-diabetic obese Caucasians (64 males and 51 females) and 108 Caucasian lean controls (82 males and 26 females) were studied. METHODS: Body composition was assessed by hydrodensitometry and body fat distribution was estimated by the waist-to-thigh circumference ratio (W/T). Values of 24-hour energy expenditure (24h-EE), basal metabolic rate (BMR), sleeping metabolic rate (SMR) and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured in a respiration chamber. RESULTS: BMR, adjusted for differences in fat-free mass, fat mass, age and sex, correlated with W/T in obese males (r = 0.40; p < 0.01), but not in obese females. Obese male subjects with upper body obesity had BMR significantly higher than those with lower body obesity (2189 +/- 268 vs 1974 +/- 141 kcal/day; p < 0.01), independently of differences in fat-free mass, fat mass and age. No correlations were found between W/T and adjusted 24h-EE, SMR or RQ in all examined groups. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that in obese males, upper body obesity is associated with increased metabolic rate, possibly related to higher levels of lipid turnover in visceral fat.","['Tataranni, P A', 'Larson, D E', 'Ravussin, E']","['Tataranni PA', 'Larson DE', 'Ravussin E']","['Clinical Diabetes and Nutrition Section, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Phoenix, Arizona.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Coll Nutr,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,8215879,,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/*pathology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Basal Metabolism', 'Body Composition/*physiology', 'Circadian Rhythm/physiology', 'Densitometry', 'Energy Metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*metabolism/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Respiration/physiology']",,,,,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07315724.1994.10718449 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Coll Nutr. 1994 Dec;13(6):569-74. doi: 10.1080/07315724.1994.10718449.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The obese patient represents multiple problems for the clinical physician. The biggest is the fact that the bariatric patient does not follow the common physiology learned during medical school, and therefore some morbidities and mortalities have been underevaluated and not treated adequately or promptly. To fully understand all the causes relating to the higher incidence of morbidity and mortality in obese patients, further delineation of the underlying pathophysiology is necessary.

In one sample (N = 2500), obesity was defined as a BMI of 30 to 40 kg/m(2), and in the other (N = 2500), obesity was defined as a BMI > 40. RESULTS: Six hundred twenty physicians responded. They rated physical inactivity as significantly more important than any other cause of obesity (p < 0.0009). Two other behavioral factors-overeating and a high-fat diet-received the next highest mean ratings. More than 50% of physicians viewed obese patients as awkward, unattractive, ugly, and noncompliant. The treatment of obesity was rated as significantly less effective (p < 0.001) than therapies for 9 of 10 chronic conditions. Most respondents (75%), however, agreed with the consensus recommendations that a 10% reduction in weight is sufficient to improve obesity-related health complications and viewed a 14% weight loss (i.e., 78 +/- 5 kg from an initial weight of 91 kg) as an acceptable treatment outcome. More than one-half (54%) would spend more time working on weight management issues if their time was reimbursed appropriately. DISCUSSION: Primary care physicians view obesity as largely a behavioral problem and share our broader society's negative stereotypes about the personal attributes of obese persons. Practitioners are realistic about treatment outcomes but view obesity treatment as less effective than treatment of most other chronic conditions.","['Foster, Gary D', 'Wadden, Thomas A', 'Makris, Angela P', 'Davidson, Duncan', 'Sanderson, Rebecca Swain', 'Allison, David B', 'Kessler, Amy']","['Foster GD', 'Wadden TA', 'Makris AP', 'Davidson D', 'Sanderson RS', 'Allison DB', 'Kessler A']","['University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Obes Res,Obesity research,9305691,,IM,"['Adult', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/etiology/*psychology/therapy', 'Physicians, Family/*psychology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Weight Loss']",,,,,2003/10/22 05:00,2004/07/21 05:00,['2003/10/22 05:00'],"['2003/10/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/22 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/oby.2003.161 [doi]'],ppublish,Obes Res. 2003 Oct;11(10):1168-77. doi: 10.1038/oby.2003.161.,"['P30DK056336/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK56114/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential benefit of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum (B. pseudolongum) on obesity, gut microbiota, and its physiological mechanism. The obese mice model was established with a high-fat diet (HFD), and the treatment were used the strain B. pseudolongum. We investigated the changes in fat content, plasma metabolites and gut microbiota on obese mice and B. pseudolongum treated obese mice. We found that B. pseudolongum treatment significantly decreased the body mass (about 12 %), plasma triglycerides (about 12.4 %), gross energy intake (about 12.8 %), and visceral fat (about 26.5 %) in obese mice. Further, High-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA demonstrated that B. pseudolongum treatment markedly recovered the gut microbiota dysbiosis in obese mice, including the diversity of microbiota and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. B. pseudolongum treatment increased the abundance of the bacterial genus Butyricimonas and Bifidobacterium. Therefore, B. pseudolongum may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of diet-induced obesity (DIO). B. pseudolongum treatment could change host gut microbiota and provide benefits to host digestive processes that mitigate metabolic diseases.","['Bo, Ting-Bei', 'Wen, Jing', 'Zhao, Yuan-Chun', 'Tian, Shuang-Jie', 'Zhang, Xue-Ying', 'Wang, De-Hua']","['Bo TB', 'Wen J', 'Zhao YC', 'Tian SJ', 'Zhang XY', 'Wang DH']","['State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects and Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; CAS Center for Excellence in Biotic Interactions, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects and Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; CAS Center for Excellence in Biotic Interactions, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects and Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; CAS Center for Excellence in Biotic Interactions, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects and Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; CAS Center for Excellence in Biotic Interactions, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects and Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; CAS Center for Excellence in Biotic Interactions, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.

OBJECTIVE: We employed Weiner's attribution theory of controllability (Weiner, 1988, 2011) to examine perceived causes of obesity, emotional responses, and related policy implications. If the perceived cause is controllable (eating and lifestyle habits), we expected less sympathy and greater anger toward obese people and support for prejudicial hiring policies based on weight. If the cause is perceived as uncontrollable (genetic), sympathy is anticipated as well as opposition to such hiring policies. METHOD: We conducted multivariate analyses with data from two nationally representative surveys of U.S. adults. CONCLUSION: Our findings supported the hypotheses, showing that sympathy and lack of anger toward obese people are strongly determined by a genetic attribution for obesity. Moreover, sympathy and the genetic attribution are significant predictors of opposition to hiring policies that discriminate against obese people. Finally, in a second study, chief among several causal attributions for obesity-lack of will power, lack of exercise, marketing of foods, and genetics-we discovered biological attribution functions as the key predictor of perceptions that obese people are frequent targets of discrimination. We suggest governments and the food industry should be more attuned to the underlying beliefs of the public about the causes of obesity when formulating programs and policies to address the issue.","['Joslyn, Mark R', 'Haider-Markel, Donald P']","['Joslyn MR', 'Haider-Markel DP']","['Department of Political Science, 1541 Lilac Lane, 504 Blake Hall, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 66044, USA.', 'Department of Political Science, 1541 Lilac Lane, 504 Blake Hall, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 66044, USA.

Obese subjects have a much greater likelihood than normal-weight children of acquiring dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, and impaired glucose metabolism, which significantly increase their risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Elevated TSH concentrations in association with normal or slightly elevated free T4 and/or free T3 levels have been consistently found in obese subjects, but the mechanisms underlying these thyroid hormonal changes are still unclear. Whether higher TSH in childhood obesity is adaptive, increasing metabolic rate in an attempt to reduce further weight gain, or indicates subclinical hypothyroidism or resistance and thereby contributes to lipid and/or glucose dysmetabolism, remains controversial. This review highlights current evidence on thyroid involvement in obese children and discusses the current controversy regarding the relationship between thyroid hormonal derangements and obesity-related metabolic changes (hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) in such population. Moreover, the possible mechanisms linking thyroid dysfunction and pediatric obesity are reviewed. Finally, the potential role of lifestyle intervention as well as of therapy with thyroid hormone in the treatment of thyroid abnormalities in childhood obesity is discussed.","['Pacifico, Lucia', 'Anania, Caterina', 'Ferraro, Flavia', 'Andreoli, Gian Marco', 'Chiesa, Claudio']","['Pacifico L', 'Anania C', 'Ferraro F', 'Andreoli GM', 'Chiesa C']","['Department of Pediatrics, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,['0 (Thyroid Hormones)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Child', 'Comorbidity', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Obesity/*epidemiology/immunology/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Thyroid Gland/immunology/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Thyroid Hormones/metabolism', 'Weight Loss']",,,,,2011/12/02 06:00,2012/04/17 06:00,['2011/12/02 06:00'],"['2011/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-8981(11)00640-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cca.2011.11.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2012 Feb 18;413(3-4):396-405. doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2011.11.013.

RESULTS: A total of 16.7% of patients were obese. The proportion of obese patients was greater at the branch clinic, but providers in the medical treatment facility had a higher obesity recognition rate (40% vs. 26%). Thirty-one percent of obese patients at both locations were noted to have hypertension. Providers at the medical treatment facility performed significantly better in documentation of hypertension and screening for orthopedic complications. Branch clinic providers performed better in screening for abdominal complaints. CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of military dependents presenting for well-child care are obese. Overall screening and intervention rates were poor, but rates were slightly better at the medical treatment facility.","['Podraza, John', 'Roberts, Timothy A']","['Podraza J', 'Roberts TA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA 23708, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Mil Med,Military medicine,2984771R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mass Screening', '*Military Personnel', '*Naval Medicine', 'Obesity/*diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Prevalence', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,,2009/01/20 09:00,2009/03/14 09:00,['2009/01/20 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [medline]']",['10.7205/milmed.173.12.1199 [doi]'],ppublish,Mil Med. 2008 Dec;173(12):1199-202. doi: 10.7205/milmed.173.12.1199.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten obese subjects (body mass index 42 +/- 2) and 10 age- and sex-matched non-obese volunteers were studied with continuous indirect calorimetry in the basal state and after the ingestion of a standardized test meal. Six obese subjects (body mass index 44 +/- 2) were examined on two occasions, once before and once after gastric banding and an average weight reduction of 18 +/- 3 kg. Basal oxygen uptake and energy expenditure were 30% (P less than 0.001) greater in the obese subjects compared to non-obese controls. After the meal, pulmonary oxygen uptake and energy expenditure increased rapidly and reached a relatively constant level after 60 min; for pulmonary oxygen uptake the average rise above basal was less in the obese (17.7 +/- 1.6%) than the non-obese (27.8 +/- 1.9%, P less than 0.001); the increase in energy expenditure was 18.5 +/- 1.7% in obese and 30.8 +/- 2.1% in non-obese subjects (P less than 0.001). After weight reduction, oxygen uptake and energy expenditure in the basal state were 20% lower (P less than 0.05) than before weight reduction. The average post-prandial increase in oxygen uptake was greater after weight reduction (24.8 +/- 2.0%) than before (16.7 +/- 1.6%, P less than 0.001). Corresponding values for energy expenditure were 27.2 +/- 2.2 and 18.2 +/- 2.2% (P less than 0.001). It is concluded that: (1) the thermogenic response to a mixed meal is lower in obese compared to non-obese individuals; and, (2) this impaired response is partly normalized after weight reduction. These findings suggest that a diminished meal-induced thermogenesis is a secondary phenomenon rather than a primary pathogenic factor in human obesity.","['Thorne, A', 'Hallberg, D', 'Wahren, J']","['Thorne A', 'Hallberg D', 'Wahren J']","['Department of Surgery, Huddinge University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Physiol,"Clinical physiology (Oxford, England)",8309768,,IM,"['Adult', 'Calorimetry, Indirect', 'Eating/*physiology', 'Energy Metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/blood/*physiopathology/surgery', 'Time Factors', 'Weight Loss/*physiology']",,,,,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1475-097x.1989.tb01002.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Physiol. 1989 Oct;9(5):481-98. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-097x.1989.tb01002.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Factors relevant to abdominal obesity in obese Korean women were general characteristics (age, marital status, occupation, education, and menopause) and health behaviors (time for recreational physical activities and energy intake). In men, these factors tended to be health behaviors, including time spent on leisure physical activity, and sitting.

Physiologic changes in obesity can alter both the volume of distribution and clearance of many commonly used antimicrobials. These changes often present challenges such as estimation of creatinine clearance to predict drug clearance. Although these physiologic changes are increasingly being characterized, few studies assessing alterations in tissue drug distribution and the effects of obesity on antimicrobial pharmacokinetics have been published. The available data are most plentiful for antibiotics that historically have included clinical therapeutic drug monitoring. These data suggest that dosing of vancomycin and aminoglycosides be based on total body weight and adjusted body weight, respectively. Obese patients may require larger doses of beta-lactams to achieve similar concentrations as those of patients who are not obese. Fluoroquinolone pharmacokinetics are variably altered by obesity, which prevents a uniform approach. Data on the pharmacokinetics of drugs that have activity against gram-positive organisms-quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin-reveal that they are altered in the presence of obesity, but more data are needed to solidify dosing recommendations. Limited data are available on nonantibacterials. An understanding of the physiologic changes in obesity and the available literature on specific antibiotics is valuable in providing a framework for rational selection of dosages in this increasingly common population of obese patients.","['Pai, Manjunath P', 'Bearden, David T']","['Pai MP', 'Bearden DT']","['Division of Pharmacy Practice, College of Pharmacy, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Infective Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Body Weight', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Obesity/classification/epidemiology/*physiopathology', 'Tissue Distribution']",,,,,2007/07/28 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/07/28 09:00'],"['2007/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1592/phco.27.8.1081 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2007 Aug;27(8):1081-91. doi: 10.1592/phco.27.8.1081.,,,,,,,81,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The QRS voltage for the obese group was slightly lower than the voltage of the normal population; but in a significant number of the patients restudied after weight loss, the QRS voltage decreased (37 out of 58 patients). In inferolateral leads non specific flattening of the T wave was observed in the obese group (71/144); it became normal as they lost weight. The P and QRS axes of the obese group initially were within normal limits but more to the left; they moved slightly to the right, although still within normal limits as the patients lost weight. Two conclusions can be drawn from the study: a) low voltage is not a significant feature in the ECG of the obese and, b) the most consistent finding in obese patients is a flattening of the T wave.","['Eisenstein, I', 'Edelstein, J', 'Sarma, R', 'Sanmarco, M', 'Selvester, R H']","['Eisenstein I', 'Edelstein J', 'Sarma R', 'Sanmarco M', 'Selvester RH']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Electrocardiol,Journal of electrocardiology,0153605,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Weight', '*Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*physiopathology/therapy']",,,,,1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0022-0736(82)80003-4 [doi]'],ppublish,J Electrocardiol. 1982 Apr;15(2):115-8. doi: 10.1016/s0022-0736(82)80003-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty overweight or obese children and adolescents were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. All participants received dietary advice and were encouraged to increase physical activity level. The intervention group additionally participated in 60-minute guided active play/physical activity twice a week for 5 months. Physical activity was recorded; aerobic fitness and body composition were measured at inclusion and after cessation of intervention. RESULTS: Physical activity level during weekend days was significantly higher for the intervention group compared with the controls after 5 months intervention (p=0.04). The mean reduction in percentage of body fat was 1.8% (95%CI: 0.6, 3.1) in the intervention group (p=0.04) and not significant among the controls (0.9 [-0.9, 2.7]). There was no change in aerobic fitness. CONCLUSION: Five months of guided active play was associated with increased physical activity levels during weekend days and reduced body fat, although weakly, in overweight and obese children and adolescents participating in multi-disciplinary weight reduction programmes.","['Berntsen, Sveinung', 'Mowinckel, Petter', 'Carlsen, Kai-Hakon', 'Lodrup Carlsen, Karin C', 'Pollestad Kolsgaard, Magnhild L', 'Joner, Geir', 'Anderssen, Sigmund A']","['Berntsen S', 'Mowinckel P', 'Carlsen KH', 'Lodrup Carlsen KC', 'Pollestad Kolsgaard ML', 'Joner G', 'Anderssen SA']","['Department of Paediatrics, Woman and Child division, Ulleval University Hospital, 0806 Oslo, Norway. sveinung.berntsen@nih.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Pediatr Obes,International journal of pediatric obesity : IJPO : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,101256330,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Composition', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Exercise Therapy', 'Female', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', '*Life Style', 'Male', '*Motor Activity', 'Norway', 'Obesity/diet therapy/physiopathology/psychology/*therapy', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Physical Fitness', '*Play and Playthings', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,2009/05/14 09:00,2010/07/07 06:00,['2009/05/14 09:00'],"['2009/05/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['911129456 [pii]', '10.3109/17477160902957166 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pediatr Obes. 2010;5(1):64-71. doi: 10.3109/17477160902957166.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted primarily in Eurocentric adult populations have identified approximately 100 loci that predispose to obesity and type II diabetes. GWAS in children and individuals of non-European descent, both disproportionately affected by obesity, are fewer. Rare syndromic and monogenic obesities account for only a small portion of childhood obesity, so understanding the role of other genetic variants and their combinations in heritable obesities is key to developing targeted and personalized therapies. Tight and responsive regulation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling pathway is crucial to maintaining healthy energy metabolism, and mutations in PKA-linked genes represent the most common cause of monogenic obesity. METHODS: For this study, we performed targeted exome sequencing of 53 PKA signaling-related genes to identify variants in genomic DNA from a large, ethnically diverse cohort of obese or metabolically challenged youth. RESULTS: We confirmed 49 high-frequency variants, including a novel variant in the PDE11A gene (c.152C>T). Several other variants were associated with metabolic characteristics within ethnic groups. DISCUSSION: We conclude that a PKA pathway-specific variant search led to the identification of several new genetic associations with obesity in an ethnically diverse population.","['Bloyd, Michelle', 'Sinaii, Ninet', 'Faucz, Fabio Rueda', 'Iben, James', 'Coon, Steven L', 'Caprio, Sonia', 'Santoro, Nicola', 'Stratakis, Constantine A', 'London, Edra']","['Bloyd M', 'Sinaii N', 'Faucz FR', 'Iben J', 'Coon SL', 'Caprio S', 'Santoro N', 'Stratakis CA', 'London E']","['Section on Endocrinology and Genetics, Program on Developmental Endocrinology and Genetics, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Biostatistics and Clinical Epidemiology Service, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Section on Endocrinology and Genetics, Program on Developmental Endocrinology and Genetics, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Molecular Genomics Core, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Molecular Genomics Core, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Section on Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.', 'Section on Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.', 'Department of Medicine and Health Sciences, ""V.

However, although environmental variables undoubtedly play a role in the development of obesity, it is now clear that genetic variation is also involved in the determination of an individual's susceptibility to body fat accumulation. In addition, it is also widely accepted that obesity is not a single homogeneous phenotype. It is also heterogeneous regarding its causes and metabolic complications. The regional distribution of body fat appears to be an important correlate of the metabolic complications that have been related to obesity. Due to their higher accumulation of abdominal fat, men are generally more at risk for the metabolic complications of obesity than women whereas some obese women, with large gluteal-femoral adipose depots may have a cosmetic problem which may not necessarily require medical intervention. Several studies have been conducted to understand the mechanisms by which abdominal obesity is related to diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. It appears that the increased risk of abdominal obesity is the result of complex hormonal and metabolic interactions. Studies in genetic epidemiology have shown that both total body fatness and the regional distribution of body fat have a significant genetic component. Standardized intervention studies using an identical twin design have shown that individuals that have the same genetic background tend to show similar changes in body fat and in plasma lipoprotein levels when exposed to standardized caloric excess or energy restriction. Finally, although abdominal obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, not every abdominal obese subject will experience metabolic complications, suggesting that some obese individuals may be more susceptible than others. Variation in several genes relevant to lipid and lipoprotein metabolism may alter the relation of abdominal obesity to dyslipoproteinemias. Abdominal obesity should therefore be considered as a factor that exacerbates an individual's susceptibility to cardiovascular disease.","['Despres, J P', 'Moorjani, S', 'Lupien, P J', 'Tremblay, A', 'Nadeau, A', 'Bouchard, C']","['Despres JP', 'Moorjani S', 'Lupien PJ', 'Tremblay A', 'Nadeau A', 'Bouchard C']","['Physical Activity Sciences Laboratory, Laval University, Ste-Foy, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,['0 (Lipoproteins)'],IM,"['Adipose Tissue/metabolism', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipoproteins/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Obesity/etiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Twins, Monozygotic']",,,,,1992/08/18 00:00,1992/08/18 00:01,['1992/08/18 00:00'],"['1992/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00231535 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1992 Aug 18;113(2):151-69. doi: 10.1007/BF00231535.,,,,,,,82,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2015, we screened 24,363 obese patients from the 2005 longitudinal health insurance database, which is part of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. From the same database, 97,452 non-obese patients were also screened out. Age, gender, and index dates were matched. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze the previous exposure risk of obese and CSA patients. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Obese patients were more likely to be exposed to CSA than non-obese patients would (AOR = 2.234, 95% CI = 1.483-4.380, p < 0.001). In addition, the closeness of the exposure time to the index time is positively correlated with the severity of obesity and has a dose-response effect (CSA exposure < 1 year, AOR = 2.386; CSA exposure >/= 1 year and <5 years, AOR = 1.725; CSA exposure time >/= 5 years, AOR = 1.422). The CSA exposure time of obese patients was 1.693 times that of non-obese patients.

The stigma and bias people with obesity (PwO) experience is one of the barriers hindering the dialogue between PwO and their Health Care Professionals (HCPs). The results from the ACTION IO Australian cohort are reported here. Identification of local barriers can inform strategies to improve access to quality obesity care within Australia. METHODS: The ACTION-IO study was an online cross-sectional survey conducted in 11 countries during June-October 2018. In Australia 1,000 community based adult PwO (body mass index >/=30 kg/m based on self-reported height and weight) and 200 HCPs involved with direct patient care (seeing >/=10 patients with obesity/month) completed the survey. RESULTS: There was a mean delay of 8.9 years from when a PwO first started to struggle with their weight, and the initial discussion with an HCP about this. HCPs acknowledged weight loss efforts in only 38.5% of their patients, although 74.6% of PwO had attempted weight loss. Most PwO (82.0%) assumed full responsibility for their weight loss. HCPs identified short appointment times (60.5%) and the cost of obesity medication, programmes and services (58.5%) as barriers to weight management conversations and weight loss, respectively. Most PwO want their HCP to raise the issue of weight with 64 % reporting finding such conversations positive and helpful. CONCLUSION: Compared to global results, Australian PwO took 3 years longer to seek medical care about their weight. Better recognition of obesity's impact and targeting barriers to care are needed.","['Rigas, Georgia', 'Williams, Kathryn', 'Sumithran, Priya', 'Brown, Wendy A', 'Swinbourne, Jessica', 'Purcell, Katrina', 'Caterson, Ian D']","['Rigas G', 'Williams K', 'Sumithran P', 'Brown WA', 'Swinbourne J', 'Purcell K', 'Caterson ID']","['Department of Bariatric Surgery, St. George Private Hospital, Kogarah, Sydney, Australia.

As is the case for other species, obesity appears to promote insulin resistance in horses and it is through this pathophysiological process that many of the adverse medical consequences of obesity are being characterized. Equine medical conditions that have been described in the context of obesity and insulin resistance differ from those in humans. Chronic human conditions that have been attributed to obesity and insulin resistance, such as atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus, are rarely described in obese horses. Significant current interest is centered on the recognition that insulin resistance plays a role in the pathogenesis of laminitis, a potentially severe and debilitating cause of lameness in the equine species. Other equine medical conditions that are more likely in obese, insulin-resistant individuals include hyperlipemia (hepatic lipidosis) and developmental orthopedic disease (osteochondrosis). Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (equine Cushing's syndrome) represents another common endocrinopathic condition of older horses associated with insulin resistance. This review presents an introductory overview of the present understanding of obesity and insulin resistance and how these conditions may be associated with disease conditions in horses.","['Johnson, Philip J', 'Wiedmeyer, Charles E', 'Messer, Nat T', 'Ganjam, Venkataseshu K']","['Johnson PJ', 'Wiedmeyer CE', 'Messer NT', 'Ganjam VK']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri 65211, USA.

One reason for the paucity of information in this area is the lack of appropriate animal models for the study of human obesity. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to develop a small animal model of dietary-induced obesity that mimics many of the characteristics of human obesity. We studied female New Zealand White rabbits fed either a normal (n = 17) or high-fat diet (n = 15) and examined the cardiovascular consequences of obesity, including changes in blood pressure, humoral activation, and end-organ effects such as cardiac hypertrophy. After 12 wk, rabbits on the high-fat diet were 46% heavier than their lean counterparts (5.49 +/- 0.09 vs. 3.77 +/- 0.06 kg, respectively; P = 0.0001). Obese rabbits had higher resting heart rates than lean rabbits (220 +/- 7 vs. 177 +/- 6 beats/min; P = 0.0001) and developed hypertension (96 +/- 2 vs. 85 +/- 1 mmHg; P = 0.0001), hyperinsulinemia (32.5 +/- 3.4 vs. 15.5 +/- 1.0 microU/ml; P = 0.0001), hyperglycemia (162.4 +/- 2.9 vs. 141.9 +/- 2.7 mg/dl; P = 0.0001), and elevated triglycerides (102.3 +/- 9.1 vs. 48.5 +/- 4.0 mg/dl; P = 0.0001). Obese rabbits also developed cardiac hypertrophy, as evidenced by left ventricular (LV) dry weights that were 52% greater in obese than in lean rabbits (P = 0.0003). In addition, LV total protein was increased in proportion to the increase in LV weight. The results of this study suggest that rabbits fed a high-fat diet for a period of 12 wk develop many of the characteristics of human obesity. The obese rabbit should provide a small and relatively inexpensive animal model to investigate mechanisms of obesity-related cardiovascular abnormalities.","['Carroll, J F', 'Dwyer, T M', 'Grady, A W', 'Reinhart, G A', 'Montani, J P', 'Cockrell, K', 'Meydrech, E F', 'Mizelle, H L']","['Carroll JF', 'Dwyer TM', 'Grady AW', 'Reinhart GA', 'Montani JP', 'Cockrell K', 'Meydrech EF', 'Mizelle HL']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson 39216-4505, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,['0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cardiomegaly/*etiology', 'Diet', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Hypertension/*etiology', 'Neurotransmitter Agents/*metabolism', 'Obesity/*complications/etiology/*metabolism', 'Rabbits']",,,,,1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpheart.1996.271.1.H373 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1996 Jul;271(1 Pt 2):H373-8. doi: 10.1152/ajpheart.1996.271.1.H373.,['HL-51971/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prevalence of obesity among U.S. children and adolescents has almost tripled since 1980, with 17% of all youth and children now considered obese. Nine million children aged 6-19 years are overweight, making obesity the largest health care threat facing today's children. Historically, the arsenal against obesity has been primarily focused on interventions that increase physical activity and decrease caloric intake. American weight loss strategies that incorporate dietary modifications and exercise have proven effective in achieving weight loss, but most of the weight is regained over time. Mindfulness based interventions, combined with other traditional weight loss strategies, have the potential to offer a long-term, holistic approach to wellness. However, research reports examining the complementary addition of mindfulness based approaches in the treatment obesity and eating disorders are relatively scarce in the empirical literature.

Moreover, it has been observed in germ-free mice that transplantation of the microbiota of either obese or lean mice influences body weight, suggesting that the gut ecosystem is a relevant target for weight management. Certain strains of probiotics may regulate body weight by influencing the host's metabolic, neuroendocrine and immune functions.

Increased total blood volume creates a high cardiac output state that may cause ventricular dilatation and ultimately eccentric hypertrophy of the left (and possibly the right) ventricle. Eccentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy produces diastolic dysfunction. Systolic dysfunction may ensue due to excessive wall stress if wall thickening fails to keep pace with dilatation. This disorder is referred to as obesity cardiomyopathy. The presence of systemic hypertension in obese individuals facilitates development of LV dilatation and hypertrophy. Congestive heart failure may occur in such individuals, and may be attributable to LV diastolic dysfunction or to combined LV diastolic and systolic dysfunction. The sleep apnea/obesity hypoventilation syndrome occurs in 5% of morbidly obese individuals and is potentially life-threatening. Treatment of obesity cardiomyopathy consists of weight loss, salt restriction, and diuretics. Digitalis and vasodilators may be useful in selected cases. Central obesity is probably a risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease. Alterations in lipid and insulin metabolism may facilitate development of coronary heart disease in obese patients.","['Alpert, M A', 'Hashimi, M W']","['Alpert MA', 'Hashimi MW']","['Division of Cardiology, University of South Alabama, College of Medicine, Mobile.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,,IM,"['Heart Diseases/*etiology/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*complications/physiopathology', 'Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome/etiology/physiopathology', 'Obesity, Morbid/complications']",,,,,1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9629(15)35462-8 [pii]', '10.1097/00000441-199308000-00011 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 1993 Aug;306(2):117-23. doi: 10.1097/00000441-199308000-00011.,,,,,,,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we assessed the positive and negative effects of informing obese people about the genetic etiology of being overweight. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred ninety-four obese people were randomized to 2 interventions (a 1-session consultation for obese people on how to manage obesity either including genetic information or not); their results were compared to a control group (116). Subjects were assessed before and after consultation and 6 months later. MEASUREMENTS: Weight, scales on feeling guilty for being overweight, self-control, negative mood (primary endpoint), body acceptance, restraint eating. RESULTS: Both types of consultations were considered helpful by the participants, and had comparable effects on body weight. The consultation with genetic information was rated superior in terms of leading to new insights (advantage for consultation with genetic information, even 6 months later; p = 0.046). No negative effects (e.g., loss of self-efficacy/self-control, increase of body weight; all p > 0.20 for interaction consultation x time) were observed for informing obese people about the genetic etiology of being overweight. The consultation resulted in long-term improvement of negative mood if it included genetic information in the case of participants with a family history of obesity and if it included no genetic information in the case of obese people without a family history of obesity (p = 0.03 for interaction of group, intervention, and time). CONCLUSIONS: Consultations in obesity can be helpful in general. These consultations should include genetic information if people have a family history of obesity.","['Rief, Winfried', 'Conradt, Matthias', 'Dierk, Jan-Michael', 'Rauh, Elisabeth', 'Schlumberger, Pia', 'Hinney, Anke', 'Hebebrand, Johannes']","['Rief W', 'Conradt M', 'Dierk JM', 'Rauh E', 'Schlumberger P', 'Hinney A', 'Hebebrand J']","['Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany. rief@staff.uni-marburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Gen Intern Med,Journal of general internal medicine,8605834,,IM,"['Aged', 'Eating', 'Educational Status', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Guilt', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/epidemiology/*genetics/prevention & control', '*Patient Education as Topic', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Risk Factors']",PMC2219810,,,,2007/09/20 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/09/20 09:00'],"['2007/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['353 [pii]', '10.1007/s11606-007-0353-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Gen Intern Med. 2007 Nov;22(11):1553-9. doi: 10.1007/s11606-007-0353-7.

As such, the optimal weight management strategy for obese CKD patients remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the outcomes of obese, CKD stage 3b patients after 3 weight loss interventions, including medical weight management, sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), were followed to determine which strategy optimizes long-term survival. SETTING: University hospital, Aurora, Colorado. METHODS: A decision analytic Markov state transition model was created to simulate the life of 30,000 obese patients with CKD stage 3b, as they progressed to end-stage renal disease, transplantation, and death. Life expectancy after conservative medical weight management, RYGB, and SG were estimated. Base case patients were defined as being 50 years old and having a preintervention BMI of 40 kg/m(2). Sensitivity analysis of initial BMI was performed. All Markov parameters were extracted from literature review. RESULTS: RYGB and SG were associated with improved survival for patients with preintervention body mass index of >38 kg/m(2). Compared with conservative weight management, base case patients who underwent RYGB gained 10.6 months of life, and gained 8.3 months of life after SG. CONCLUSIONS: Balancing progression of CKD with improved survival on end-stage renal disease for obese patients requires selective use of weight management strategies. RYGB and SG improved survival for CKD patients with Class II and III obesity, but not for patients with Class I obesity. As such, aggressive weight loss interventions should be reserved for patients with Class II and III obesity, while more conservative methods should be offered to those with Class I obesity.","['Choudhury, Rashikh A', 'Yoeli, Dor', 'Moore, Hunter B', 'Yaffe, Hillary', 'Hoeltzel, Gerard D', 'Dumon, Kristoffel R', 'Williams, Noel N', 'Abt, Peter L', 'Conzen, Kendra D', 'Nydam, Trevor L']","['Choudhury RA', 'Yoeli D', 'Moore HB', 'Yaffe H', 'Hoeltzel GD', 'Dumon KR', 'Williams NN', 'Abt PL', 'Conzen KD', 'Nydam TL']","['University of Colorado Hospital, Department of Surgery- Division of Transplant Surgery, Aurora, Colorado.

As a result, anesthesiologists routinely encounter obese patients daily in their clinical practice. The use of regional anesthesia is becoming increasingly popular for these patients. When appropriate, a regional anesthetic offers advantages and should be considered in the anesthetic management plan of obese patients. The following is a review of regional anesthesia in obesity, with special consideration of the unique challenges presented to the anesthesiologist by the obese patient. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies report difficulty in achieving peripheral and neuraxial blockade in obese patients. For example, there is an increased incidence of failed blocks in obese patients compared with similar, normal weight patients. Despite difficulties, regional anesthesia can be used successfully in obese patients, even in the ambulatory surgery setting.

Children with an obesity index > or = 40%, aged six to 12 years, were screened in Kagoshima City in 1992. Parents were notified if their children needed an evaluation that included a family history and measurements of the blood pressure, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, atherogenic index (ASI), triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Parents were informed of the results of the evaluation and invited to attend a lecture on the treatment of obesity in children. A total of 378 obese children were evaluated. However, the parents of only 39 children attended the lecture. Children whose parents attended had higher mean total levels of cholesterol (190 +/- 25 vs 175 +/- 28, P < 0.01) and ASI values (3.2 +/- 0.9 vs 2.7 +/- 0.9, P < 0.02) than those whose parents did not attend. There were no significant differences in other factors. Only 4.2% of parents whose children showed no abnormal values, except for obesity, attended the lecture, compared with 20.3% (P < 0.01) or 16.9% (P < 0.05) of parents whose children had abnormal levels of cholesterol or abnormal ASI. Parents may be more concerned about hypercholesterolemia or arteriosclerosis than obesity per se. We should perhaps use the total cholesterol or ASI values, not just the severity of obesity, to motivate parents to enter their children into treatment programs for obesity.","['Yoshinaga, M', 'Yuasa, Y', 'Kitahara, T', 'Shimago, A', 'Miyata, K', 'Sameshima, K', 'Imamura, M', 'Arima, K', 'Matsuoka, K']","['Yoshinaga M', 'Yuasa Y', 'Kitahara T', 'Shimago A', 'Miyata K', 'Sameshima K', 'Imamura M', 'Arima K', 'Matsuoka K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Acta Paediatr Jpn,Acta paediatrica Japonica : Overseas edition,0370357,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Motivation', 'Obesity/blood/*psychology/therapy', 'Parents/*psychology', '*Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1442-200x.1994.tb03232.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr Jpn. 1994 Oct;36(5):493-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-200x.1994.tb03232.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Experimental. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four obese children aged 8-12 y were randomized to one of three groups in which children had to accumulate 750 or 1500 pedometer counts to earn 10 min of access to video games or movies, or to a control group in which access to sedentary behaviors was provided noncontingently. MEASUREMENTS: Physical activity in the 20 min experimental session was measured by electronic pedometer and triaxial accelerometer (ie TriTrac(R)). Activity liking was measured by visual analog scales. Anthropometric and demographic characteristics were also assessed. RESULTS: Children in the 750 and 1500 count contingency groups engaged in significantly more physical activity and spent more time in moderate intensity activity or higher compared with controls. Children in the Contingent 1500 group engaged in more activity and spent more time in moderate or greater intensity activity compared to children in the Contingent 750 group. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that contingent access to sedentary activities can reinforce physical activity in obese children, and changes in physical activity level depend in part on the targeted physical activity goal.","['Goldfield, G S', 'Kalakanis, L E', 'Ernst, M M', 'Epstein, L H']","['Goldfield GS', 'Kalakanis LE', 'Ernst MM', 'Epstein LH']","['Department of Psychology, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord,International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,9313169,,IM,"['Child', 'Child Behavior/*psychology', 'Exercise/*psychology', '*Feedback', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/prevention & control/psychology/*therapy', '*Reinforcement, Psychology']",,,,,2000/08/05 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/08/05 11:00'],"['2000/08/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/05 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.ijo.0801248 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord. 2000 Jul;24(7):888-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.ijo.0801248.,"['R01HD25997/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HD38284/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obesity affects the respiratory system by several mechanisms, including by direct mechanical changes due to fat deposition in the chest wall, abdomen and upper airway, as well as via systemic inflammation. The increased mechanical load in obese individuals leads to reduced chest wall and lung compliance and increased work of breathing. While there is generally minimal effect on spirometric values, as body mass index increases, the expiratory reserve volume, and hence functional residual capacity, reduces, often approaching residual volume in more severe obesity. The majority of evidence however suggests that obese individuals free from lung disease have relatively normal gas exchange. The link between asthma and obesity, while initially unclear, is now recognized as being a distinct asthma phenotype. While studies investigating objective markers of asthma have shown that there is no association between obesity and airway hyper-responsiveness, a recent working group identified obesity as a major risk factor for the development of asthma in all demographic groups. Although the temptation may be to attribute obesity as the cause of dyspnoea in symptomatic obese patients, accurate respiratory assessment of these individuals is necessary. Lung function tests can confirm that any altered physiology are the known respiratory consequences of obesity. However, given that obesity causes minimal changes in lung function, significant abnormalities warrant further investigation. An important consideration is the knowledge that many of the respiratory physiology consequences of obesity are reversible by weight loss.","['Brazzale, Danny J', 'Pretto, Jeffrey J', 'Schachter, Linda M']","['Brazzale DJ', 'Pretto JJ', 'Schachter LM']","['Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Institute for Breathing and Sleep, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Institute for Breathing and Sleep, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Centre for Obesity Research and Education, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Respirology,"Respirology (Carlton, Vic.)",9616368,,IM,"['Body Mass Index', 'Humans', '*Lung Diseases/complications/diagnosis/physiopathology', '*Obesity/complications/diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Respiration', 'Respiratory Function Tests/*methods', 'Respiratory System/physiopathology', 'Symptom Assessment']",,['NOTNLM'],"['asthma', 'lung volume measurement', 'obesity', 'pulmonary gas exchange', 'respiratory function test']",,2015/06/03 06:00,2016/01/15 06:00,['2015/06/03 06:00'],"['2014/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/resp.12563 [doi]'],ppublish,Respirology. 2015 Jul;20(5):715-21. doi: 10.1111/resp.12563.

Based on findings that portrayals of obesity in entertainment media foster weight-related stigmatization, the goal of the current study was to analyze media coverage of obesity in daily newspapers. METHODS: For the year 2006, all 1,563 issues of five high-circulation daily newspapers (two national newspapers, one tabloid newspaper, and two local newspapers) in Germany were systematically searched for obesity-related terms. Out of these issues, 222 articles about human overweight were identified and subjected to a quantitative content analysis using a reliable coding system. RESULTS: The national and local newspapers examined offered more comprehensive and less incorrect information about obesity than the tabloid newspaper. Compared with the other types of papers, the information about obesity in the local papers was less negative and less catastrophizing. The national newspapers presented more attributions of obesity to internal, controllable causes than the other newspaper types, and the tabloid newspaper used more personalized descriptions of cases with extreme features. CONCLUSION: The current coverage of obesity in daily newspapers may contribute to stigmatization. Future research should examine readers' reception of newspaper information and potential destigmatization through more precise and less subjective coverage of obesity.","['Hilbert, Anja', 'Ried, Jens']","['Hilbert A', 'Ried J']","['Department of Psychology, Philipps University of Marburg, Germany. hilbert@staff.uni-marburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Obes Facts,Obesity facts,101469429,,IM,"['Germany', 'Health Education', 'Humans', 'Information Dissemination', '*Newspapers as Topic', 'Obesity/etiology/*psychology/therapy', '*Stereotyping']",PMC6444496,,,,2010/01/08 06:00,2010/01/29 06:00,['2010/01/08 06:00'],"['2010/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['000195697 [pii]', 'ofa-0002-0046 [pii]', '10.1159/000195697 [doi]']",ppublish,Obes Facts. 2009;2(1):46-51. doi: 10.1159/000195697.

Obesity-induced neurohumoral activation appears to be involved. The association between obesity and hypertension shows large inter-individual variability, likely through genetic mechanisms. Obesity affects overall cardiovascular and metabolic risk; yet, the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular risk is complex and not sufficiently addressed in clinical guidelines. The epidemiological observation that obesity may be protective in patients with established cardiovascular disease is difficult to translate into clinical experience and practice. Weight loss is often recommended as a means to lower blood pressure. However, current hypertension guidelines do not provide evidence-based guidance on how to institute weight loss. In fact, weight loss influences on blood pressure may be overestimated. Nevertheless, weight loss through bariatric surgery appears to decrease cardiovascular risk in severely obese patients. Eventually, most obese hypertensive patients will require antihypertensive medications. Data from large-scale studies with hard clinical endpoints on antihypertensive medications specifically addressing obese patients are lacking and the morbidity from the growing population of severely obese patients is poorly recognized or addressed. Because of their broad spectrum of beneficial effects, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are considered to be the most appropriate drugs for antihypertensive treatment of obese patients. Most obese hypertensive patients require two or more antihypertensive drugs. Finally, how to combine weight loss strategies and antihypertensive treatment to achieve an optimal clinical outcome is unresolved.","['Jordan, Jens', 'Yumuk, Volkan', 'Schlaich, Markus', 'Nilsson, Peter M', 'Zahorska-Markiewicz, Barbara', 'Grassi, Guido', 'Schmieder, Roland E', 'Engeli, Stefan', 'Finer, Nick']","['Jordan J', 'Yumuk V', 'Schlaich M', 'Nilsson PM', 'Zahorska-Markiewicz B', 'Grassi G', 'Schmieder RE', 'Engeli S', 'Finer N']","['Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Medical School Hannover, Germany. jordan.jens@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Hypertens,Journal of hypertension,8306882,['0 (Antihypertensive Agents)'],IM,"['Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bariatric Surgery', 'Blood Pressure', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*complications/epidemiology/therapy', 'Life Style', 'Obesity/*complications/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Weight Loss/drug effects']",,,,,2012/05/11 06:00,2012/09/01 06:00,['2012/05/11 06:00'],"['2012/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['00004872-201206000-00001 [pii]', '10.1097/HJH.0b013e3283537347 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hypertens. 2012 Jun;30(6):1047-55. doi: 10.1097/HJH.0b013e3283537347.,,,,,,,,['J Hypertens. 2012 Jun;30(6):1103-5.

The eating style was measured by recording cumulative eating curves with a universal eating monitor, using yoghurt as a standardized experimental meal. RESULTS: The eating behavior of obese children differed significantly from normal weight children only when the mother was present in the laboratory. Overweight children ate faster with larger bites and showed an acceleration of their eating rate toward the end of the meal. DISCUSSION: Such an eating style can be hypothesized to explain an increased calorie intake in obese children, promoting a positive energy balance in the long term.

METHODS: The joint contributions of individual and environmental factors on obesity status (obese vs. morbidly obese) and trying to lose weight (yes vs. no) were evaluated using generalized estimating equations. Patients at 29 clinics in rural areas (N = 414, M age 55.0 years (SD = 15.4), 66.3% female) completed anthropometric assessments of weight and height along with survey assessments of individual sociodemographics and trying to lose weight. Rural environments were assessed on aggregated physician access, and sociodemographic context. RESULTS: Most participants (70%, M BMI = 38.3) were obese and 30% morbidly obese. A majority (73%, n = 302) of the sample was trying to lose weight. Compared to obese, morbidly obese participants were more likely to be younger, disproportionately female, not have private insurance, have more comorbid conditions, and rate themselves in worse health in comparison to their obese peers. Compared to not trying to lose weight, trying to lose weight participants were more likely to be younger, disproportionately female, have fewer comorbid conditions, and have attempted to lose weight more times through exercise. Few relationships were seen between environmental variables and obesity or trying to lose weight.

It has been hypothesized that the psychological sequelae from childhood trauma account for this risk, though no study has examined whether an increased risk of obesity is found in persons without psychological disorders. We examined exposure to early life stressors and body mass index (BMI) in 696 adults without significant medical or psychiatric history. Bivariate correlation showed that the total number of early life stressors (r=0.08), age (r=0.19), and sex (r=0.16) were significantly related to adult BMI. Given the relationship between sex and BMI, we examined the contribution of early life stressors to adult obesity separately for men and women. In men, hierarchical regression showed that exposure to early life stressors predicted adult obesity. Specifically, history of being bullied/rejected (Obese 31%, Normal weight, 9%) and emotional abuse (Obese, 17%; Normal weight, 2%) predicted adult obesity after controlling for the effects of age. In women, no relationship between early life stressors and adult obesity was found.

Childhood obesity, which may cause chronic diseases including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and cancer, etc., deserves more attention. However, few studies highlight the association between childhood obesity and psychological diseases. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the psychological condition in obese children. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-seven obese (body mass index (BMI) >95th percentile) and 200 normal weight children (BMI between 5th and 85th percentile) aged 9-16 years were enrolled into this case-control study. In order to assess the self-concept, anxiety and depression levels: the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale (PHCSCS), state and trait anxiety inventory for children (STAI-C) and the children depression inventory (CDI) were administered both obese and control groups. RESULTS: There were significant differences among obese and control groups in terms of the total score of PHCSCS [55 (22-69) versus 65 (57-74)], STAI-C [37 (20-55) versus 28 (20-42)], and CDI [12 (4-39)] versus [8 (3-19)]; respectively (p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001). We also found statistically significant differences among groups in all of the subscales parameters of PHCSCS (p<0.001).

The corresponding decrease in male fertility and fecundity may be explained in parallel to obesity, and obesity should be considered as an etiology of male fertility. Studies show that obesity contributes to infertility by reducing semen quality, changing sperm proteomes, contributing to erectile dysfunction, and inducing other physical problems related to obesity. Mechanisms for explaining the effect of obesity on male infertility include abnormal reproductive hormone levels, an increased release of adipose-derived hormones and adipokines associated with obesity, and other physical problems including sleep apnea and increased scrotal temperatures. Recently, genetic factors and markers for an obesity-related infertility have been discovered and may explain the difference between fertile obese and infertile obese men. Treatments are available for not only infertility related to obesity, but also as a treatment for the other comorbidities arising from obesity. Natural weight loss, as well as bariatric surgery are options for obese patients and have shown promising results in restoring fertility and normal hormonal profiles. Therapeutic interventions including aromatase inhibitors, exogenous testosterone replacement therapy and maintenance and regulation of adipose-derived hormones, particularly leptin, may also be able to restore fertility in obese males. Because of the relative unawareness and lack of research in this area, controlled studies should be undertaken and more focus should be given to obesity as an etiolgy of male infertility.","['Cabler, Stephanie', 'Agarwal, Ashok', 'Flint, Margot', 'du Plessis, Stefan S']","['Cabler S', 'Agarwal A', 'Flint M', 'du Plessis SS']","['Center for Reproductive Medicine, The Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",China,Asian J Androl,Asian journal of andrology,100942132,"['0 (Adipokines)', '0 (Aromatase Inhibitors)', '0 (Gonadal Steroid Hormones)']",IM,"['Adipokines/physiology', 'Aromatase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Body Mass Index', 'Erectile Dysfunction/etiology', 'Fertility', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/*etiology', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Obesity/*complications/genetics/physiopathology/therapy', 'Semen Analysis', 'Waist Circumference']",PMC3739371,,,,2010/06/10 06:00,2010/10/05 06:00,['2010/06/10 06:00'],"['2010/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['aja201038 [pii]', '10.1038/aja.2010.38 [doi]']",ppublish,Asian J Androl. 2010 Jul;12(4):480-9. doi: 10.1038/aja.2010.38.

Dysfunctional obese adipose tissue plays a pivotal role in the development of insulin resistance. However, the mechanism of how dysfunctional obese-adipose tissue develops insulin-resistant circumstances remains poorly understood. Therefore, this review attempts to highlight the potential mechanisms behind obesity-associated insulin resistance. Multiple risk factors are directly or indirectly associated with the increased risk of obesity; among them, environmental factors, genetics, aging, gut microbiota, and diets are prominent. Once an individual becomes obese, adipocytes increase in their size; therefore, adipose tissues become larger and dysfunctional, recruit macrophages, and then these polarize to pro-inflammatory states. Enlarged adipose tissues release excess free fatty acids (FFAs), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Excess systemic FFAs and dietary lipids enter inside the cells of non-adipose organs such as the liver, muscle, and pancreas, and are deposited as ectopic fat, generating lipotoxicity. Toxic lipids dysregulate cellular organelles, e.g., mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes. Dysregulated organelles release excess ROS and pro-inflammation, resulting in systemic inflammation. Long term low-grade systemic inflammation prevents insulin from its action in the insulin signaling pathway, disrupts glucose homeostasis, and results in systemic dysregulation. Overall, long-term obesity and overnutrition develop into insulin resistance and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation through lipotoxicity, creating the circumstances to develop clinical conditions. This review also shows that the liver is the most sensitive organ undergoing insulin impairment faster than other organs, and thus, hepatic insulin resistance is the primary event that leads to the subsequent development of peripheral tissue insulin resistance.","['Ahmed, Bulbul', 'Sultana, Rifat', 'Greene, Michael W']","['Ahmed B', 'Sultana R', 'Greene MW']","['Department of Nutrition, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, 36849, United States.

Understanding risk factors and causes for obesity is the basis for adequate psychological interventions. We provide an overview of psychological aspects of obesity, such as motivation and impulsivity, and present components of cognitive behavioral therapy and modalities of intervention. A better understanding of psychological factors is necessary to achieve more effective interventions and long-term success of behavior change.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Historical cohort study including all patients delivered in our maternity between 1st January 2002 and 31st December 2004. Intra uterine death and fetal loss before 22 weeks were excluded. Women were categorized by the Body Mass Index: less than 25, between 25 and 30, and more than 30. Maternal data, obstetrical complications, labor and its complications, and neonatal outcomes were studied. RESULTS: During these 3 years, 23.5% (1336/5686) of patients were overweight and 7.5% (425/5686) were obese. Obstetrical pathologies (gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertension, preeclampsia and fetal macrosomia) and labour induction were more significantly frequent in obese patients (P < 0.01). We noted twice more caesarean sections during labour in obese patients. The rate of artificial placental delivery was significantly higher in obese patients (P < 0.01). Obese patients with prior caesarean sections had a rate of vaginal delivery significantly lower than non obese patients with prior C-sections (23.6 vs 43.8%; P < 0.01). Mean children birth weight was significantly higher in obese patients (3305 vs 3181 g; P < 0.01) with no impact on Apgar score. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that obesity is responsible for major obstetrical complications, for what should no doubt be considered as high risk pregnancies. Our practices must take these complications into account by ensuring an adapted and early management in order to improve maternal and neonatal issues.","['Ducarme, G', 'Rodrigues, A', 'Aissaoui, F', 'Davitian, C', 'Pharisien, I', 'Uzan, M']","['Ducarme G', 'Rodrigues A', 'Aissaoui F', 'Davitian C', 'Pharisien I', 'Uzan M']","['Service de gynecologie-obstetrique, APHP, CHU Jean-Verdier, avenue du 14-Juillet, 93143 Bondy cedex, France. gducarme@gmail.com']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Gynecol Obstet Fertil,"Gynecologie, obstetrique & fertilite",100936305,,IM,"['Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cesarean Section', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Obesity/*complications', 'Obstetric Labor Complications/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,2007/01/02 09:00,2007/03/23 09:00,['2007/01/02 09:00'],"['2006/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1297-9589(06)00456-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gyobfe.2006.10.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Gynecol Obstet Fertil. 2007 Jan;35(1):19-24. doi: 10.1016/j.gyobfe.2006.10.029.

Goal-directed fluid therapy optimizes cardiac performance and thus tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery. We therefore tested the hypothesis that intra- and postoperative PsqO(2) is significantly reduced in obese patients undergoing standard fluid management compared to goal-directed fluid administration. METHODS: We randomly assigned 60 obese patients (BMI >/= 30 kg/m(2)) undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery to receive either esophageal Doppler-guided goal-directed fluid management or conventional fluid treatment. Our primary outcome parameter was intra- and postoperative PsqO(2) measured with a polarographic electrode in the subcutaneous tissue of the upper arm. A random effects linear regression model was used to analyze the effect of intervention. RESULTS: Overall, mean (+/- SD) PsqO(2) was significantly higher in obese patients receiving goal-directed therapy compared to conventional fluid therapy (65.8 +/- 28.0 mmHg vs. 53.7 +/- 21.7, respectively; repeated measures design adjusted difference: 13.0 mmHg [95% CI 2.3 to 23.7; p = 0.017]). No effect was seen intraoperatively (69.6 +/- 27.9 mmHg vs. 61.4 +/- 28.8, difference: 9.7 mmHg [95% CI -3.8 to 23.2; p = 0.160]); however, goal-directed fluid management improved PsqO(2) in the early postoperative phase (63.1 +/- 27.9 mmHg vs. 48.4 +/- 12.5, difference: 14.5 mmHg [95% CI 4.1 to 24.9; p = 0.006]). Intraoperative fluid requirements did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Goal-directed fluid therapy improved subcutaneous tissue oxygenation in obese patients. This effect was more pronounced in the early postoperative period.

The present review aims to synthesize the main investigation results regarding beliefs, attitudes, and practices of healthcare providers, as they seem to negatively influence the practitioner's actions. The words ""obesity"", ""beliefs"", ""healthcare professionals"", ""general practitioners"", ""attitudes"", ""practices"", ""health physicians"", and ""family practitioners"" were entered into databases, such as EBSCOHost, ScienceDirect, Psychlnfo, PubMed, and SciELO. Thirteen studies from 1991 to 2011 were reviewed. The data indicate a lack of appropriate understanding and adequate competence regarding obesity, which likely contributes to ambivalent belief development and negative attitudes toward obese individuals, who are described as unmotivated, lazy, and lacking self-control. These professionals consider it hard to deal with obesity, manifesting low expectations of success regarding weight loss, thus considering themselves unsuccessful. Their practices are inconsistent, mirroring a certain skepticism towards the efficacy of available interventions. Either during graduation or as active practitioners, it is imperative to make healthcare providers aware of the impact their beliefs regarding obesity can exert on their practices, as these may impair appropriate and effective treatment delivery to obese individuals.","['Teixeira, Filipa Valente', 'Pais-Ribeiro, Jose Luis', 'Maia, Angela Rosa Pinho da Costa']","['Teixeira FV', 'Pais-Ribeiro JL', 'Maia AR']","['Psychology and Education Science School, Universidade do Porto, Portugal. filipa.v.teixeira@gmail.com']","['eng', 'por']","['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Brazil,Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira (1992),9308586,,IM,"['Attitude of Health Personnel', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*psychology/therapy', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Weight Loss']",,,,,2012/05/10 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']",['S0104-42302012000200024 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992). 2012 Mar-Apr;58(2):254-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only children highly sensitive to abundant palatable food and with conditions favouring little physical activity are at risk of obesity. A high-risk environment has no effect on non predisposed children. An obesogenic environment is therefore a trigger but not the primary cause of obesity: it simply enables phenotypic expression of a genetic predisposition. As most children are not constitutionally predisposed to obesity, prevention strategies should focus on children at risk. This is supported by the disappointing results of most collective interventions, particularly at school. In addition, broad-reaching preventive campaigns may increase discrimination towards obese children and induce eating behaviour disorders in non predisposed children. Children at risk of becoming obese are those who have adiposity rebound before 6 years of age. These at-risk children must be detected early and offered personalized interventions aimed at preventing further fat gain. In the future, the improvement of obesity pathophysiology knowledge will probably allow the development of more promising preventive approaches.","['Tounian, Patrick']",['Tounian P'],"['Gastro-enterologie et nutrition pediatriques, Hopital Armand Trousseau, 26, avenue du Docteur Arnold Netter, 75012 Paris. p.tounian@trs.aphp.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Bull Acad Natl Med,Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine,7503383,,IM,"['Child', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Obesity/genetics/*prevention & control', 'Social Environment']",,,,,2010/02/03 06:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2010/02/03 06:00'],"['2010/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Bull Acad Natl Med. 2009 Jun;193(6):1243-54; discussion 1254-7.,,,,,,,,,Obesite de l'enfant: une nouvelle vision.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Participants were assigned to either MI or to nutrition counseling and followed up over 3 months. Trained undergraduate students delivered the MI intervention. RESULTS: There were significant reductions in weight in women in the MI intervention, but not in men.

The aim of this study was to examine whether parasympathetic alterations are also associated with a more severe insulin resistance in non diabetic obese subjects. 245 obese subjects (BMI = 34.2 +/- 0.4 kg/m2) aged 38.6 +/- 0.8 years, with a normal oral glucose tolerance test were included. Parasympathetic activity was evaluated by heart rate variations during three standardised tests: Valsalva, deep-breathing and active lying-to-standing, with age being taken into account. The Valsalva maneuver was abnormal in 17.5%, the deep-breathing test in 18% and the lying-to-standing test in 30.3% of the cases. One hundred and thirty subjects (52.1%) had at least one abnormal test.

In the whole series of obese subjects, heart rate variations during the deep-breathing and lying-to-standing tests correlated negatively with blood glucose (p = 0.001 and p = 0.03 respectively), and during the deep-breathing test they correlated negatively with the waist/hip ratio (p = 0.004). This data suggests that cardiac parasympathetic alterations should take part in the insulin-resistance syndrome and might account for the poor cardiovascular prognosis linked to this syndrome.","['Valensi, P', 'Paries, J', 'Assad, N', 'Lormeau, B', 'Attali, J R']","['Valensi P', 'Paries J', 'Assad N', 'Lormeau B', 'Attali JR']","[""Service d'endocrinologie-diabetologie-nutrition, hopital Jean-Verdier, universite Paris-Nord, Bondy.""]",['fre'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss,Archives des maladies du coeur et des vaisseaux,0406011,,IM,"['Adult', 'Heart Rate/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Insulin Resistance', 'Obesity/*physiopathology', 'Vagus Nerve/*physiology']",,,,,1999/09/16 00:00,1999/09/16 00:01,['1999/09/16 00:00'],"['1999/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss. 1999 Aug;92(8):1101-3.,,,,,,,,,Insulinoresistance et alteration de l'activite vagale cardiaque chez les obeses.,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, there are no medical therapies that provide significant and durable weight loss. The surgical treatment of adolescent obesity is a rapidly evolving field. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent publications have focused on the increase in the morbidity and mortality of adolescent obesity into adulthood. There have been significant findings that overweight children and adolescents progress towards severe obesity as adults. Firm guidelines for bariatric surgery in adults have been established for over 15 years, but there have been insufficient data in regards to guidelines for adolescents. The trend has always been to be more conservative, but a recent paper reviews the available literature to establish new guidelines. Adolescents can see a significant amount of weight loss in the first year after bariatric surgery with a resolution of diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors. Bariatric surgery is well tolerated and effective, but carries with it long-term nutritional deficiencies, which need to be assessed and supplemented. SUMMARY: Given the recent rise in obesity seen in this population, the surgical management of the adolescent has increased in popularity. Bariatric surgery is well tolerated and provides significant weight loss in those who are severely obese.","['Barnett, Sean J']",['Barnett SJ'],"[""Surgical Weight Loss Program for Teens, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Ohio 45229, USA.

In the present study, effect of a half-year-long life-style modification program on the morphologic and functional characteristics of the heart was investigated in twenty-one obese women. Life-style modification contained a diet with reduced energy uptake (1000-1300 Cal/day) and a regular physical training of minimum 3-4 hours weekly. By the end of the sixth month the weight loss was 5.1 kg (5.9%) on an average. There was a marked reduction in cardiac dimensions measured by echocardiography, with a very slight, non-significant decrease in left ventricular internal diameter, and a marked, significant reduction in the left ventricular wall thickness. Decrease of the left ventricular muscle mass exceeded the decrease of body weight. A marked elevation was found in the E/A quotient that reflected a definite improvement in diastolic function. Results indicate that physical training programs have a favourable effect on the echocardiographic parameters, therefore the process is reversible even without a pharmacological intervention.","['Sido, Z', 'Jako, P', 'Pavlik, G']","['Sido Z', 'Jako P', 'Pavlik G']","['National Institute for Sports Medicine, Department of Conditioning and Internal Medicine, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Hungary,Acta Physiol Hung,Acta physiologica Hungarica,8309201,,IM,"['Adult', 'Echocardiography', '*Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/diet therapy/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Ventricular Function, Left', 'Weight Loss/*physiology']",,,,,2001/06/29 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/06/29 10:00'],"['2001/06/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1556/APhysiol.87.2000.3.3 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Physiol Hung. 2000;87(3):241-51. doi: 10.1556/APhysiol.87.2000.3.3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty-eight overweight to severely obese adults were divided into three groups (tertile) based on their BMI. The groups were T1 group (BMI = 30.5 +/- 1.5, n = 23), T2 group (BMI = 34.3 +/- 1.0, n = 23), and T3 group (BMI = 40.2 +/- 3.7, n = 22).

Individual linear regressions between %HR reserve (%HRR) and %VO2 reserve (%VO2R), %HRR and %VO2 peak (%VO2peak), %maximal HR (%HRmax) and %VO2R, and %HRmax and %VO2peak were calculated. When all the subjects were grouped together, the %HRR-%VO2R mean regression was partially related to the line of identity, while the %HRR-%VO2peak, %HRmax-%VO2R, and %HRmax-%VO2peak mean regressions were all significantly different than the line of identity (P < 0.001). The degree of obesity accounted for approximately 15% of the variation for both %HRR-%VO2R and %HRR-%VO2peak mean regressions. The %HRmax-%VO2R and %HRmax-%VO2peak mean regressions were not affected by the degree of obesity but resting HR accounted for 28-37% of the variation. The relationship between the exercise intensity determined by the %HRR-%VO2R and the %HRR-%VO2peak mean regression seems to be influenced by the degree of obesity. The degree of obesity does not affect the relationship between exercise intensity generated by the %HRmax-%VO2R or %HRmax-%VO2peak equations but the resting HR does.","['Pinet, Bernard M', ""Prud'homme, Denis"", 'Gallant, Chantal A', 'Boulay, Pierre']","['Pinet BM', ""Prud'homme D"", 'Gallant CA', 'Boulay P']","['School of Human Kinetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Obesity (Silver Spring),"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",101264860,,IM,"['Adult', 'Exercise/*physiology', 'Female', 'Heart Rate/physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/metabolism/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Oxygen Consumption/physiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2008/05/17 09:00,2009/03/06 09:00,['2008/05/17 09:00'],"['2008/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['oby2008272 [pii]', '10.1038/oby.2008.272 [doi]']",ppublish,Obesity (Silver Spring). 2008 Sep;16(9):2088-95. doi: 10.1038/oby.2008.272.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Participants in the obese and normal-weight control groups completed standardized self-report questionnaires designed to assess attitudes and behaviors regarding eating and weight (Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns-Revised and Binge Eating Scale), maladaptive schemata (Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Version), mood disturbance (Profile of Mood States-Adolescents) and socially desirable responding (Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding). RESULTS: The obese patients reported a significantly greater severity of maladaptive schemata (after controlling for demographic variables and binge eating disorder status) than the normal-weight control subjects. In addition, within the obese group, there were significant positive correlations between the severity of maladaptive schema scores and both mood disturbance and problem eating scores.

METHODS: Between May 2016 and February 2020, a retrospective analysis of individuals undergoing complex revision surgery of the thoracolumbar spine was performed at a single institution. Obesity was defined as BMI >/= 30.0 kg/m(2). PMI < 500 mm(2)/m(2) for males and < 412 mm(2)/m(2) for females were used to define low muscle mass. A Spine Surgical Invasiveness Index (SSII) > 10 was used to define complex revision surgery. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to ascertain the effects of low muscle mass, obesity, age, and gender on the likelihood of the occurrence of any AE. RESULTS: A total of 114 consecutive patients were included in the study. Fifty-four patients were in the obese cohort and 60 patients in the non-obese cohort. There was not a significant difference in perioperative outcomes of both the obese and non-obese patients. There were 22 obese patients (40.7%) and 33 non-obese patients (55.0%) that experienced any AE (p = 0.130). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that individuals with low muscle mass had a significantly higher likelihood for an AE than individuals with normal or high muscle mass (OR: 7.53, 95% CI: 3.05-18.60). Obesity did not have a significant effect in predicting AEs. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is not associated with perioperative AEs, 30-day readmission rates, 30-day re-operation rates, rate of discharge to a facility, or post-operative length of stay (LOS) among patients undergoing complex revision thoracolumbar spine surgery.

Successful prevention and treatment of childhood obesity depends on increasing the physical activity patterns of obese youth. However, motivating the obese child to participate in physical activity is difficult. METHODS: We designed a four-phase physical activity intervention, consisting of a structured progressive exercise program of moderate intensity, along with motivational methods to increase physical activity and improve body movement awareness. RESULTS: Seventy-three overweight children participated in the weight management program. They had a significant weight loss and reduction in body fat, which was maintained at 1-year follow-up. Subjects also maintained lean body mass and showed improved physical activity patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive exercise, used in conjunction with nutrition and behavior modification, provides successful motivational strategies. These strategies encourage increased physical activity patterns, the adoption of regular structured exercise training, and the loss of excess body fat.","['Sothern, M S', 'Hunter, S', 'Suskind, R M', 'Brown, R', 'Udall, J N Jr', 'Blecker, U']","['Sothern MS', 'Hunter S', 'Suskind RM', 'Brown R', 'Udall JN Jr', 'Blecker U']","['Department of Pediatrics, Louisiana State University Medical School, New Orleans, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,South Med J,Southern medical journal,0404522,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', '*Exercise', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Motivation', 'Obesity/psychology/*therapy', 'Weight Loss']",,,,,1999/06/18 10:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/06/18 10:00'],"['1999/06/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/06/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007611-199906000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,South Med J. 1999 Jun;92(6):577-84. doi: 10.1097/00007611-199906000-00006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, in older persons, obesity can exacerbate the age-related decline in physical function and lead to frailty. However, appropriate treatment for obesity in older persons is controversial because of the reduction in relative health risks associated with increasing body mass index and the concern that weight loss could have potential harmful effects in the older population. This joint position statement from the American Society for Nutrition and NAASO, The Obesity Society reviews the clinical issues related to obesity in older persons and provides health professionals with appropriate weight-management guidelines for obese older patients. The current data show that weight-loss therapy improves physical function, quality of life, and the medical complications associated with obesity in older persons. Therefore, weight-loss therapy that minimizes muscle and bone losses is recommended for older persons who are obese and who have functional impairments or medical complications that can benefit from weight loss.","['Villareal, Dennis T', 'Apovian, Caroline M', 'Kushner, Robert F', 'Klein, Samuel']","['Villareal DT', 'Apovian CM', 'Kushner RF', 'Klein S']","['Division of Geriatrics and Nutritional Sciences, Center for Human Nutrition, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Obes Res,Obesity research,9305691,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aging/*physiology', 'Body Composition/*physiology', 'Bone Density/physiology', 'Exercise/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Obesity/complications/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Weight Loss']",,,,,2005/12/13 09:00,2006/01/27 09:00,['2005/12/13 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/11/1849 [pii]', '10.1038/oby.2005.228 [doi]']",ppublish,Obes Res. 2005 Nov;13(11):1849-63. doi: 10.1038/oby.2005.228.,['DK56341/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,205,,,"['American Society for Nutrition', 'NAASO, The Obesity Society']",,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that despite their distinctive phenolic profiles, GTP and OTP exerted similar anti-obesity properties after 12 weeks of dietary intervention. Furthermore, cecal microbiota profiling exhibited comparable modulatory effects of GTP and OTP on multiple bacterial taxa, including Parabacteroides distasonis, Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, and Akkermansia muciniphila, which were strongly associated with obesity related indexes.

Childhood obesity has become a global public health crisis. The prevalence is highest in western and industrialized countries, but still low in some developing countries. The prevalence also varies by age and gender. The WHO Americas and eastern Mediterranean regions had higher prevalence of overweight and obesity (30-40%) than the European (20-30%), south-east Asian, western Pacific, and African regions (10-20% in the latter three). A total of 43 million children (35 million in developing countries) were estimated to be overweight or obese; 92 million were at risk of overweight in 2010. The global overweight and obesity prevalence has increased dramatically since 1990, for example in preschool-age children, from approximately 4% in 1990 to 7% in 2010. If this trend continues, the prevalence may reach 9% or 60 million people in 2020. The obesity-SES association varies by gender, age, and country. In general, SES groups with greater access to energy-dense diets (low-SES in industrialized countries and high-SES in developing countries) are at increased risk of being obese than their counterparts.","['Wang, Youfa', 'Lim, Hyunjung']","['Wang Y', 'Lim H']","['Johns Hopkins Global Center for Childhood Obesity, Department of International Health, Human Nutrition Program, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. ywang@jhsph.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",England,Int Rev Psychiatry,"International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)",8918131,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Global Health/*economics', 'Humans', 'Obesity/classification/*economics/*epidemiology', '*Social Class']",PMC4561623,,,,2012/06/26 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09540261.2012.688195 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Rev Psychiatry. 2012 Jun;24(3):176-88. doi: 10.3109/09540261.2012.688195.,"['1U54 HD070725 - 01/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD064685/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK081335/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HD070725/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK81335 - 01A1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['NIHMS688226'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Classification of obesity based on anatomic distribution of body fat allows for identification of a group of patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Abdominal (upper body) obesity, measured as the waist/hip ratio, is a strong independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease and should be used to assess a subgroup in need of medical weight loss treatment. A focus on dietary fat intake and the magnitude of overeating ""caloric intake"" are central to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease observed in the obese person. Identification of the process of overeating (magnitude of recent weight gain, episodes of weight cycling) is important in the design of successful medical nutrition treatment programs. A nutrition/medical history that includes age of obesity onset and duration of obesity provides additional criteria for assessment of risk of disease. Childhood-onset obesity and prolonged obesity (greater than 15 years) has been associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Recently, grades of obesity based on body mass index have provided a valuable marker for treatment. Each reduction in obesity grade (equal to delta 5 body mass index or delta 11.6 kg) is associated with a decrease in risk of medical illness. The new focus of obesity treatment should be to decrease body weight in 10% to 15% increments (equal to 1 grade) with emphasis on reducing the risk of medical illness and treatment intensity (e.g., number of existing medical visits, hospitalization).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Blackburn, G L', 'Kanders, B S']","['Blackburn GL', 'Kanders BS']","['Cancer Research Institute, New England Deaconess Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02215.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Cardiol,The American journal of cardiology,0207277,,IM,"['Body Weight', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Obesity/classification/complications/*therapy', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,1987/10/30 00:00,1987/10/30 00:01,['1987/10/30 00:00'],"['1987/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9149(87)90592-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9149(87)90592-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Cardiol. 1987 Oct 30;60(12):55G-58G. doi: 10.1016/0002-9149(87)90592-3.,['HL 31989-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS: 41 obese patients treated with weight reducing gastric surgery, 31 obese patients treated conventionally, and 43 non-obese subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in left ventricular mass and relative wall thickness. RESULTS: Obese patients had higher blood pressure, greater left ventricular mass, and increased relative wall thickness than did matched non-obese control subjects. Obese subjects treated with gastric surgery had a substantial weight loss and a significant reduction in all variables when compared with conventionally treated obese subjects. Univariate and multivariate analysis of pooled data from the two groups of obese subjects showed that changes in relative wall thickness and left ventricular mass were more closely related to the change in weight than to the concomitant change in blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Structural heart abnormalities occurring in conjunction with obesity diminish after weight loss. The regression in these structural aberrations is better predicted by the weight loss than by the accompanying reduction in blood pressure. To prevent or improve abnormalities of heart structure in obese people, weight control should be the primary goal; it should be regarded as at least as important as regulating blood pressure.","['Karason, K', 'Wallentin, I', 'Larsson, B', 'Sjostrom, L']","['Karason K', 'Wallentin I', 'Larsson B', 'Sjostrom L']","['Department of Cardiology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Heart Ventricles/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*pathology/physiopathology/surgery', 'Weight Loss/*physiology']",PMC2127625,,,,1997/11/15 00:00,1997/11/15 00:01,['1997/11/15 00:00'],"['1997/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.315.7113.912 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1997 Oct 11;315(7113):912-6. doi: 10.1136/bmj.315.7113.912.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bariatric surgery can reduce body weight, and it is one of the better ways to improve metabolic disease and lifestyle. The aim of this study was to explore a new cohort of patients with obesity and evaluate the gender differences and the steatosis status within the gender group. METHODS: A cohort of 250 adult obese patients with BMI >/= 30 and age >18 years, eligible for gastric bariatric surgery at Pineta Grande Hospital, Castel Volturno (Italy) was studied. RESULTS: The prevalence in women was higher (72.40%) than men (27.60%). Overall, results indicated many statistically significant gender differences in hematological and clinical parameters. Analysis of the subcohorts based on the severity of steatosis revealed differences of this condition between the genders. Steatosis was more prevalent in the male subcohort, but female patients revealed greater within-group differences. CONCLUSIONS: Many differences were found not only in the total cohort but also between the gender subcohorts, both in the presence and absence of steatosis. We can conclude that the pathophysiological, genetic, and hormonal patterns affecting these patients delineate different individual profiles.","['Donghia, Rossella', 'Schiano Di Cola, Rita', 'Cesaro, Filomena', 'Vitale, Andrea', 'Lippolis, Giuseppe', 'Lisco, Teresa', 'Isernia, Roberta', 'De Pergola, Giovanni', 'De Nucci, Sara', 'Rinaldi, Roberta', 'Liso, Marina', 'Giardiello, Cristiano']","['Donghia R', 'Schiano Di Cola R', 'Cesaro F', 'Vitale A', 'Lippolis G', 'Lisco T', 'Isernia R', 'De Pergola G', 'De Nucci S', 'Rinaldi R', 'Liso M', 'Giardiello C']","['National Institute of Gastroenterology-IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", 70013 Castellana Grotte, Italy.', 'Pineta Grande Hospital, 81030 Castel Volturno, Italy.', 'Pineta Grande Hospital, 81030 Castel Volturno, Italy.', 'Pineta Grande Hospital, 81030 Castel Volturno, Italy.', 'National Institute of Gastroenterology-IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", 70013 Castellana Grotte, Italy.', 'National Institute of Gastroenterology-IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", 70013 Castellana Grotte, Italy.', 'National Institute of Gastroenterology-IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", 70013 Castellana Grotte, Italy.', 'National Institute of Gastroenterology-IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", 70013 Castellana Grotte, Italy.', 'National Institute of Gastroenterology-IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", 70013 Castellana Grotte, Italy.', 'National Institute of Gastroenterology-IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", 70013 Castellana Grotte, Italy.', 'National Institute of Gastroenterology-IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", 70013 Castellana Grotte, Italy.', 'National Institute of Gastroenterology-IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", 70013 Castellana Grotte, Italy.', 'Pineta Grande Hospital, 81030 Castel Volturno, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Nutrients,Nutrients,101521595,,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Female', 'Male', 'Adolescent', '*Obesity, Morbid/complications/surgery/epidemiology', '*Fatty Liver/epidemiology', 'Obesity/complications/epidemiology/surgery', '*Bariatric Surgery']",PMC10221192,['NOTNLM'],"['bariatric surgery', 'gender', 'obesity', 'steatosis']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2023/05/27 09:42,2023/05/29 06:42,['2023/05/27 01:27'],"['2023/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2023/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2023/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/05/29 06:42 [medline]', '2023/05/27 09:42 [pubmed]', '2023/05/27 01:27 [entrez]']","['nu15102381 [pii]', 'nutrients-15-02381 [pii]', '10.3390/nu15102381 [doi]']",epublish,Nutrients. 2023 May 19;15(10):2381. doi: 10.3390/nu15102381.,,20230519,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9140-673X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9759-5378', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3817-8643', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8766-1869']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim was to investigate gastric emptying and CCK release in weight-stable obese subjects on their usual diet and to study the impact of factors known to determine gastric emptying. Patients entering a weight reduction program were asked to participate in a study examining gastric emptying by scintigraphy and CCK release in response to a meal with questionnaires on feelings of satiety. Forty-five patients (9 M, 36 F) with a mean (SD) BMI of 37.0 (4.0) kg/m2 entered the study. The mean T50 (emptying of 50%) of fluids was 20.7 (10.3) min, and that of solids 141.9 (168.3) min. The percentage emptying of solids was 34.5 (19.9)%/hr. CCK values peaked within 42 min and paralleled the subjective ratings of satiety but did not correlate with gastric emptying. Five of 45 subjects (11%) had very prolonged gastric emptying of solids; they showed higher caloric intakes and higher insulin levels. They did not differ in CCK values and ratings of satiety but scored higher in being active and awake. Without these five subjects the T50 of solids was 94.3 (36.1) min, and the percentage of emptying 37.9 (18.4)%/hr. Liquid emptying was faster and solid emptying similar compared with those of normal-weight individuals. Height, fat-free mass, and waist-hip circumference were positively related to solid emptying. In weight-stable obese subjects liquid emptying was faster and solid emptying similar to those in normal-weight subjects. Higher caloric intakes and insulin levels were present in subjects with prolonged solid emptying; they also appeared more vigilant. Body size and composition were the only determinants suggesting a faster solid emptying in taller and muscular subjects or in subjects with more intraabdominal fat.","['Mathus-Vliegen, E M H', 'Van Ierland-Van Leeuwen, M L', 'Roolker, W']","['Mathus-Vliegen EM', 'Van Ierland-Van Leeuwen ML', 'Roolker W']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. e.mathus-vliegen@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Dig Dis Sci,Digestive diseases and sciences,7902782,['9011-97-6 (Cholecystokinin)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Body Weight', 'Cholecystokinin/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gastric Emptying', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Radionuclide Imaging', '*Satiety Response', 'Time Factors']",,,,,2005/02/17 09:00,2005/03/09 09:00,['2005/02/17 09:00'],"['2005/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Dig Dis Sci. 2005 Jan;50(1):7-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her pediatrician looked at her growth chart-90 pounds (95th percentile) and height 52 inches (50th percentile)-that confirmed a clinical impression of obesity on physical examination. Her body mass index was 23.4 (>95th percentile for age).During 10 years in primary care pediatric practice, the pediatrician typically prescribed a management plan for obese school-aged and adolescent patients that started with parent and child education about potential health problems associated with obesity followed by a recommendation to decrease the caloric intake and encourage active exercise each day. She then arranged for follow-up visits to monitor weight and adherence to the management plan. However, a moment of self-refection suggested that most of her patients did not follow her advice in a sustained way. Obesity persisted in most cases. The pediatrician wondered if there was an alternative-better yet, evidence-based-approach to pediatric obesity that might provide a better outcome.","['Rhee, Kyung Kay', 'Boutelle, Kerri', 'McKenna, Matthew', 'Stein, Martin T']","['Rhee KK', 'Boutelle K', 'McKenna M', 'Stein MT']","['Division of Child Development and Community Health (Department of Pediatrics), University of California San Diego, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Dev Behav Pediatr,Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,8006933,,IM,"['Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*diagnosis/psychology/*therapy', 'Parents/psychology', 'Pediatrics/*methods']",,,,,2011/10/20 06:00,2012/04/07 06:00,['2011/10/20 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/DBP.0b013e318235ee1a [doi]'],ppublish,J Dev Behav Pediatr. 2011 Nov;32(9):688-91. doi: 10.1097/DBP.0b013e318235ee1a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THE AIM: Of this study is to assess the prevalence of OSA syndrome in a Tunisian population of obese (body mass index > or = 30 Kg/m2) and to determine its predictive factors. METHODS: It's a transversal study. One hundred patients (63 females, 37 males) were inculded. All patients underwent nocturnal polysomnography or respiratory polygraphy. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients had an OSA syndrome: mild (24.6%), moderate (30.7%) and severe (44.6%). We compared, by a statistical analysis, the group with OSA syndrome and the group without OSA syndrome. There was a predominance of men (81% of men vs 55.5 of women had OSA). Age was higher in the group with OSA syndrome (56.8 years +/- 10 vs 48.1 +/- 12, P = 0.04). Clinical symptoms such as snoring, daytime sleepiness, nocturnal awakening and respiratory pauses were more frequent in the group with OSA syndrome. Morphological abnormalities such as retrognathy and/or short neck were significantly more frequent in the group with OSA syndrome (p = 0.05 and 0.02 respectively). Cardiopathies and diabetes were more frequent in obese with OSA syndrome. CONCLUSION: In obese persons, male gender, comorbidities and /or clinical symptoms such as snoring, daytime sleepiness, nocturnal awakening and respiratory pauses, retrognathy and/or short neck are predictive of OSA syndrome. So, we propose a nocturnal recording in obese presenting at least one of these predictive factors.","['Maalej, Sonia', 'Aouadi, Samira', 'Ben Moussa, Hatem', 'Bourguiba, Meherzia', 'Ben Kheder, Ali', 'Drira, Ikram']","['Maalej S', 'Aouadi S', 'Ben Moussa H', 'Bourguiba M', 'Ben Kheder A', 'Drira I']","['Pneumologue AHU, Service de Pneumologie, D.

Some obese people overeat, as do their family or their socio-professional peers, and this cannot be considered a pathologic behaviour. Many obese patients increase their energy intake when frustrated, anxious, or tired, like many normal individuals who enjoy a better weight regulation. But when obesity increases suddenly and/or severely in these circumstances, and in gross obesity, abnormal feeding behaviour is usually responsible: prandial or, more often extraprandial overeating (nibbling, gorging, binge eating, night eating, excess alcohol, carbohydrate craving). Serotoninergic mechanisms of the latter have focused wide interest. Conflicting situations and/or anxiety are usually a factor in child obesity. Deppreciated self-image and feelings of culpability, partly secondary to obesity itself and dietary failures often contribute to feeding disturbances, sometimes surreptitious, carrying a risk of vicious circle. But weight reduction itself, while improving self image, carries a risk of unmasking depressive tendencies, especially when too quick. Hence the importance of careful and comprehensive management.","['Wolf, L M', 'Houdent, C']","['Wolf LM', 'Houdent C']",,['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Prat,La Revue du praticien,0404334,,,"['Feeding and Eating Disorders/*complications/psychology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*complications/psychology']",,,,,1989/02/16 00:00,1989/02/16 00:01,['1989/02/16 00:00'],"['1989/02/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/16 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Prat. 1989 Feb 16;39(5):394-8.,,,,,,,,,Troubles du comportement alimentaire et obesite.,,,,,,,,,,,

This review examines what is known about behavioral correlates of obesity in preschoolers and the developmental context for lifestyle modification in this age group. Information was used to critically evaluate existing weight management prevention and intervention programs for preschoolers and formulate suggestions for future intervention research development. A systematic search of the medical and psychological/behavioral literatures was conducted with no date restrictions, using PubMed, PsycInfo, and MEDLINE electronic databases and bibliographies of relevant manuscripts. Evidence suggests several modifiable behaviors, such as sugar sweetened beverage intake, television use, and inadequate sleep, may differentiate obese and healthy weight preschoolers. Developmental barriers, such as food neophobia, food preferences, and tantrums challenge caregiver efforts to modify preschoolers' diet and activity and parental feeding approaches, and family routines appear related to the negative eating and activity patterns observed in obese preschoolers. Prevention programs yield modest success in slowing weight gain, but their effect on already obese preschoolers is unclear. Multi-component, family-based, behavioral interventions show initial promise in positive weight management for already obese preschoolers. Given that obesity intervention research for preschoolers is in its infancy, and the multitude of modifiable behavioral correlates for obesity in this age group, we discuss the use of an innovative and efficient research paradigm (Multiphase Optimization Strategy; MOST) to develop an optimized intervention that includes only treatment components that are found to empirically reduce obesity in preschoolers.","['Kuhl, Elizabeth S', 'Clifford, Lisa M', 'Stark, Lori J']","['Kuhl ES', 'Clifford LM', 'Stark LJ']","[""Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is also linked to problems in cognitive functioning. Obesity is highly prevalent in individuals with MDD and is linked to a failure to return to a full level of functioning. The study's objective was to investigate the effect of obesity on cognitive impairment in participants with MDD. METHODS: This study compared cognitive performance in obese individuals with MDD and two control populations (obese individuals without a psychiatric illness and non-obese controls). A standardized battery of neuropsychological tests specifically designed to assess performance in declarative memory, executive functioning, processing speed and attention was administered. Mood ratings, physical measurements, nutritional and health questionnaires were also completed. RESULTS: We observed a consistent pattern across measures of memory, executive functioning, attention and processing speed. Whereas healthy controls performed better than both bariatric groups across the majority of measures administered, bariatric controls tended to outperform bariatric MDD patients. LIMITATIONS: The overall sample size of our study was small and thus largely explorative in nature. However, it provides compelling results (while controlling for extraneous variables such as medication load, nutritional status and common metabolic comordidities) that strongly urges for further investigation and study replication with larger sample sizes. CONCLUSIONS: We found obesity has a subtle impact on cognition in obese individuals, and when obesity is present in individuals with MDD, this impact may be significant. It is important to minimize all modifiable variables that can add to cognitive burden in this population.","['Restivo, Maria R', 'McKinnon, Margaret C', 'Frey, Benicio N', 'Hall, Geoffrey B', 'Syed, Wasimuddin', 'Taylor, Valerie H']","['Restivo MR', 'McKinnon MC', 'Frey BN', 'Hall GB', 'Syed W', 'Taylor VH']","[""Womens College Research Institute, Women's College Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', ""Mood Disorders Program and Women's Health Concerns Clinic, St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', ""Mood Disorders Program and Women's Health Concerns Clinic, St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', ""Womens College Research Institute, Women's College Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adult', 'Depressive Disorder, Major/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neuropsychological Tests', 'Obesity/complications/*psychology']",PMC5419516,,,"['Competing Interests: Dr. Valerie Taylor received an unrestricted educational', 'grant from Bristol Myers Squibb to help fund this study.

Obese identity is related to body image in the lifetime, and according to scientific literature body image dissatisfaction among obese patient persist after bariatric surgery. The objective of this review is to examine the body image changes in patients with obesity pre-and post-bariatric surgery. METHODS: We have carried out a systematic review of literature on PubMed. Initially, 169 publications have been identified, but in total, in compliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 studies have been analyzed. RESULTS: According to the examined literature, body image does not change after bariatric surgery. These patients will be difficult to adapt for a new body, because there is a persistent obese view of self. Furthermore, ex-obese patients are dissatisfied with the excessive skin after bariatric surgery. Excessive body weight, and negative self-image are replaced with dissatisfaction with excessive skin, and the factors associated with body image stability are still unknown. CONCLUSION: Literature examination raises the issue of body image dissatisfaction, but does not explain why it varies so widely across bariatric patients. Obese identity is related to body image across the lifetime and is an important factor of post-surgical outcomes. Longitudinal studies based on ideal body image pre- and post- bariatric surgery and evidence-based controlled studies on psychotherapeutic treatment for body image dissatisfaction are strongly recommended. Psychotherapy could improve body image quality and wellbeing. LEVEL I: Evidence obtained from: systematic reviews of experimental studies.","['Mento, Carmela', 'Silvestri, Maria Catena', 'Muscatello, Maria Rosaria Anna', 'Rizzo, Amelia', 'Celebre, Laura', 'Cedro, Clemente', 'Zoccali, Rocco Antonio', 'Navarra, Giuseppe', 'Bruno, Antonio']","['Mento C', 'Silvestri MC', 'Muscatello MRA', 'Rizzo A', 'Celebre L', 'Cedro C', 'Zoccali RA', 'Navarra G', 'Bruno A']","['Clinical Psychology, Psychiatric Unit, Department of Biomedical and Dental Sciences and Morphofunctional Imaging, Policlinico Hospital Messina, University of Messina, Consolare Valeria str. 1, 98125, Messina, Italy. cmento@unime.it.', 'University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Psychiatric Unit, BIOMORF Department, Policlinico Hospital in Messina, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Psychiatric Unit, Policlinico Hospital Messina, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Psychiatric Unit, Policlinico Hospital Messina, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Psychiatric Unit, BIOMORF Department, Policlinico Hospital in Messina, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'General Surgery Unit, Department of Human Pathology of Adult and Evolutive Age, University Hospital of Messina, Via Consolare Valeria 1, 98125, Messina, ME, Italy.', 'Psychiatric Unit, BIOMORF Department, Policlinico Hospital in Messina, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Germany,Eat Weight Disord,Eating and weight disorders : EWD,9707113,,IM,"['*Bariatric Surgery/psychology', 'Body Image/psychology', 'Humans', 'Obesity/psychology/surgery', '*Obesity, Morbid/surgery', 'Self Concept', 'Weight Loss']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bariatric patients', 'Body image', 'Eating disorders', 'Obese identity']",,2021/07/21 06:00,2022/05/11 06:00,['2021/07/20 12:32'],"['2020/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/20 12:32 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40519-021-01270-w [pii]', '10.1007/s40519-021-01270-w [doi]']",ppublish,Eat Weight Disord. 2022 May;27(4):1269-1278. doi: 10.1007/s40519-021-01270-w.

AIMS: To stage the degree of disability in obese patients using TSD-OC; to verify its sensitivity to change after rehabilitation. SUBJECTS: Three hundred and fifty-five adult obese individuals [body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2] undergoing rehabilitation. Exclusion criteria were severe cardiovascular or respiratory diseases, neurological and psychological conditions. Sensitivity to change of TSD-OC was evaluated in 194 patients out of the initial sample. METHODS: To define the disability levels according to TSD-OC, the method of interquartile range was applied to the initial sample. The 194 in-patients were assessed with Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Functional Visual Analogue Scale, and TSD-OC before (S0) and after 4 weeks (S1) of intensive (3 h daily) rehabilitation multidisciplinary program. Individuals were grouped according to age (1: age 30-59 yr; 2: age over 60 yr) and degree of obesity (BMI: A, 30-40 kg/m2; B, 40-50 kg/m2). RESULTS: At S1, BMI and all the clinical scores improved significantly in the whole study sample. The younger individuals with higher level of obesity showed a higher functional improvement (-51.3%). In the older subjects, improvement was not statistically different when varying BMI (A2 -13.7% vs B2 -14.6%). In the whole group, the TSD-OC improvement was statistically greater than the physical FIM gain (-25.9% vs +5.4%, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data evidenced that the TSD-OC is a sensitive measure of short-term changes in disability status of obese individuals after rehabilitation.","['Precilios, H', 'Brunani, A', 'Cimolin, V', 'Tacchini, E', 'Donini, L M', 'Fabris De Souza, S', 'Capodaglio, P']","['Precilios H', 'Brunani A', 'Cimolin V', 'Tacchini E', 'Donini LM', 'Fabris De Souza S', 'Capodaglio P']","['Rehabilitation Unit and Laboratory of Research in Biomechanics and Rehabilitation, S.

METHODS: Obese adolescents participating in a pilot study assessing the role of a behavior coach on successful weight management (n = 18) were interviewed to identify barriers and facilitators to reaching behavior goals. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the constant comparative method of qualitative analysis. RESULTS: In the rationale for weight control, adolescent girls and boys reported a desire to improve physical appearance and physical conditioning, respectively. Barriers to reaching physical activity goals among girls included unsafe neighborhoods and a negative body image. Maintaining unrealistic behavior and weight goals hindered satisfaction with behavior change and weight loss in both genders. Overall, coaching provided support that helped the obese teens feel more successful in the goal-setting process and address issues related to their disruptive environments. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes educators can include a behavior coach as part of a weight management program to help teens set behavior goals and overcome barriers to reaching behavior goals.","['Alm, Mary', 'Soroudi, Nafisseh', 'Wylie-Rosett, Judith', 'Isasi, Carmen R', 'Suchday, Sonia', 'Rieder, Jessica', 'Khan, Unab']","['Alm M', 'Soroudi N', 'Wylie-Rosett J', 'Isasi CR', 'Suchday S', 'Rieder J', 'Khan U']","['The Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota (MA)', 'Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts (NS)', 'Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, Bronx, New York (JW-R, CRI, SS)', 'Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, Bronx, New York (JW-R, CRI, SS)', 'Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, Bronx, New York (JW-R, CRI, SS)', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Adolescent Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York (JR, UK)', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Adolescent Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York (JR, UK)']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Diabetes Educ,The Diabetes educator,7701401,,,"['Adolescent', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Male', 'New York City', 'Obesity/complications/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Obesity, Morbid/rehabilitation', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychology, Adolescent', '*Urban Population', '*Weight Loss']",,,,,2008/04/01 09:00,2008/08/12 09:00,['2008/04/01 09:00'],"['2008/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['34/2/277 [pii]', '10.1177/0145721708314182 [doi]']",ppublish,Diabetes Educ. 2008 Mar-Apr;34(2):277-84. doi: 10.1177/0145721708314182.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study sought to define the relationship between PBF and body mass index (BMI) in the Vietnamese population. METHODS: The study was designed as a comparative cross-sectional investigation that involved 1217 individuals of Vietnamese background (862 women) aged 20 years and older (average age 47 yr) who were randomly selected from the general population in Ho Chi Minh City. Lean mass (LM) and fat mass (FM) were measured by DXA (Hologic QDR 4500). PBF was derived as FM over body weight. RESULTS: Based on BMI >/=30, the prevalence of obesity was 1.1% and 1.3% for men and women, respectively. The prevalence of overweight and obesity combined (BMI >/=25) was ~24% and ~19% in men and women, respectively. Based on the quadratic relationship between BMI and PBF, the approximate PBF corresponding to the BMI threshold of 30 (obese) was 30.5 in men and 41 in women. Using the criteria of PBF >30 in men and PBF >40 in women, approximately 15% of men and women were considered obese. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that body mass index underestimates the prevalence of obesity. We suggest that a PBF >30 in men or PBF >40 in women is used as criteria for the diagnosis of obesity in Vietnamese adults. Using these criteria, 15% of Vietnamese adults in Ho Chi Minh City was considered obese.","['Ho-Pham, Lan T', 'Lai, Thai Q', 'Nguyen, Mai T T', 'Nguyen, Tuan V']","['Ho-Pham LT', 'Lai TQ', 'Nguyen MT', 'Nguyen TV']","[""Bone and Muscle Research Division, Faculty of Applied Sciences, Ton DucThang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Department of Internal Medicine, Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Department of Rheumatology, People's Hospital 115, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam."", ""Department of Rheumatology, People's Hospital 115, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam."", 'Department of Medical Ethic-Behavioral Science, Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Bone and Muscle Research Division, Faculty of Applied Sciences, Ton DucThang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Osteoporosis and Bone Biology, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia; School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Australia, Sydney, Australia; Centre for Health Technologies, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*metabolism', 'Vietnam/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC4446298,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2015/05/29 06:00,2016/04/05 06:00,['2015/05/29 06:00'],"['2015/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-15-07812 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0127198 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 27;10(5):e0127198. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0127198. eCollection 2015.,,20150527,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between IVT and Maximal Fat Oxidation (MFO) in women with obesity. METHODS: Fifty-two obese female adults (age = 43.6+/-10.9 years; BMI = 38.5+/-5.2 kg/m2) were included in this study. According to the BMI classification, subjects were divided into three groups: Obese Class I (OBI, n = 16); Obese Class II (OBII, n = 20) and Obese Class III (OBIII, n = 16). All subjects performed an incremental graded exercise test to evaluate peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), IVT and MFO. MFO was evaluated using a stoichiometric equation. Fat max zone was determined for each subject within 10% of fat oxidation rates at MFO. For each HR, %HRmax, VO2 and %VO2peak variable, Pearson's correlation test was done between IVT and MFO exercise intensity. When statistical correlation was found we used a comparative statistical analysis to assess differences between IVT and MFO. Statistical significance was set at P </= 0.05. RESULTS: For each HR, %HRmax, VO2 and %VO2peak variable there was a positive significant correlation (P<0.01) between IVT and MFO. No significant differences were found for HR, %HRmax, and VO2 between IVT and MFO. %VO2peak was significantly higher at IVT than at MFO (P = 0.03). MFO rates were significantly higher in OBIII women than in women of the other two classes. In all subjects, IVT was within the fat max zone. CONCLUSION: The use of HR and VO2 corresponding to IVT could be a useful parameter not only to improve cardiorespiratory fitness but also to prescribe physical activity that maximize fat oxidation in obese subjects.","['Emerenziani, Gian Pietro', 'Ferrari, Dafne', 'Marocco, Chiara', 'Greco, Emanuela A', 'Migliaccio, Silvia', 'Lenzi, Andrea', 'Baldari, Carlo', 'Guidetti, Laura']","['Emerenziani GP', 'Ferrari D', 'Marocco C', 'Greco EA', 'Migliaccio S', 'Lenzi A', 'Baldari C', 'Guidetti L']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Movement, Human and Health Sciences, Section of Health Sciences, University of Rome ""Foro Italico"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Movement, Human and Health Sciences, Section of Health Sciences, University of Rome ""Foro Italico"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of Medical Pathophysiology, Endocrinology and Nutrition, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Movement, Human and Health Sciences, Section of Health Sciences, University of Rome ""Foro Italico"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of Medical Pathophysiology, Endocrinology and Nutrition, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'University eCampus, Novedrate, Italy.', 'Department of Movement, Human and Health Sciences, Section of Health Sciences, University of Rome ""Foro Italico"", Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Calorimetry, Indirect', 'Cardiorespiratory Fitness/*physiology', 'Exercise/physiology', 'Exercise Test', 'Female', 'Heart Rate/physiology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/metabolism/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Obesity, Morbid/metabolism/physiopathology/therapy', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen Consumption']",PMC6459513,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2019/04/12 06:00,2020/01/30 06:00,['2019/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-18-32476 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0215307 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Apr 11;14(4):e0215307. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0215307. eCollection 2019.,,20190411,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6227-3571', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1419-4550']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obesity and body fat distribution have independent roles in the development of hyperandrogenism in PCOS. Most obese and normal weight PCOS are insulin resistant and hyperinsulinemic. Moreover, a significant positive correlation exists between the degree of hyperandrogenism and that of hyperinsulinism. The pathogenetic role of obesity may involve different mechanisms, the major one being the hyperinsulemic state, since insulin is capable of stimulating ovarian androgen secretion and controlling androgen metabolism and transport in peripheral tissues. Abdominal body fat distribution in obese women with PCOS amplifies the degree of hyperandrogenism and related clinical symptoms and signs. Both loss of body weight and/or the reduction of the degree of hyperinsuliemia, induced by diet or insulin-sensitizing drugs, have important effects, since they reduce blood androgen levels and can improve ovulation and clinical signs of hyperandrogenism.","['Pasquali, R', 'Vicennati, V', 'Gambineri, A']","['Pasquali R', 'Vicennati V', 'Gambineri A']","['Departement de Medecine Interne et Gastro-enterologie, Hopital S.

The prevalence of obesity was approximately 13% among world's adult population. Recently, several reports suggested that the interference of gut microbiota composition and function is associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity. Gut microbiota produce a board range of metabolites involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, leading to the alteration in host metabolism. However, systematic evaluation of the relationship between gut microbiota, gut metabolite and host metabolite profiles in obese adults is still lacking. In this study, we used comparative metagenomics and metabolomics analysis to determine the gut microbiota and gut-host metabolite profiles in six normal and obese adults of Chinese origin, respectively. Following the functional and pathway analysis, we aimed to understand the possible impact of gut microbiota on the host metabolites via the change in gut metabolites. The result showed that the change in gut microbiota may result in the modulation of gut metabolites contributing to glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle and homolactic fermentation. Furthermore, integrated metabolomic analysis demonstrated a possible positive correlation of dysregulated metabolites in the gut and host, including l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, uric acid, kynurenic acid, cholesterol sulfate and glucosamine, which were reported to contribute to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. The findings of this study provide the possible association between gut microbiota-metabolites and host metabolism in obese adults. The identified metabolite changes could serve as biomarkers for the evaluation of obesity and metabolic disorders.","['Li, Rong', 'Huang, Xue', 'Liang, Xiao', 'Su, Min', 'Lai, Keng Po', 'Chen, Jian']","['Li R', 'Huang X', 'Liang X', 'Su M', 'Lai KP', 'Chen J']","['Guilin Medical University.', 'Department of Gastroenterology.', 'Guilin Medical University.', 'Guilin Medical University.', 'Guilin Medical University.', 'Guilin Medical University.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Brief Bioinform,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,,IM,"['Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', '*Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metabolomics', 'Obesity/blood/*metabolism/*microbiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['LC-MS', 'gut microbiota', 'metabolite', 'metagenomics', 'obesity']",,2020/08/10 06:00,2021/11/18 06:00,['2020/08/10 06:00'],"['2020/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['5882185 [pii]', '10.1093/bib/bbaa165 [doi]']",ppublish,Brief Bioinform. 2021 May 20;22(3):bbaa165. doi: 10.1093/bib/bbaa165.,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Results from a case-control study.,63-78,,"OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to evaluate psychiatric comorbidity, subjective quality of life, and impact of psychopathology on quality of life measures in a clinical sample of patients attending a center for the diagnosis and treatment of obesity compared to a matched sample of non-obese subjects. METHODS: Two hundred ninety-three consecutive obese patients (48 males, 245 females, mean age 45.41 +/- 13.55 yrs; mean BMI 35.60 +/- 6.20) were compared with a control group made of 293 non obese subjects (48 males, 245 females, mean age 45.66 +/- 13.86 yrs; mean BMI 21.8 +/- 2.06); all subjects were interviewed by means of SCID I and SCID II and completed the WHO-QoL-Bref, a self-administered instrument for evaluation of subjective quality of life. RESULTS: Obesity was associated with a significant lifetime major risk both for axis I (OR = 3.47, p = 0.000) and axis II disorders (OR = 2.27, p = 0.000); obesity was also associated with significantly lower measures of subjective quality of life on physical, social, and psychological domains; comorbidity with axis I/II disorders was associated with lower QoL measures on WHO-QoL-Bref, in particular among obese patients. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is significantly associated with a significant major risk of psychiatric comorbidity and poor quality of life; comorbid mental disorders play a significant role in worsening quality of life of obese patients; a multimodal approach to the treatment of obesity, including psychiatric evaluation and intervention, is needed to improve quality of life of patients.","['Carpiniello, Bernardo', 'Pinna, Federica', 'Pillai, Gianluca', 'Nonnoi, Valentina', 'Pisano, Enrica', 'Corrias, Silvia', 'Orru, Maria Germana', 'Orru, Walter', 'Velluzzi, Fernanda', 'Loviselli, Andrea']","['Carpiniello B', 'Pinna F', 'Pillai G', 'Nonnoi V', 'Pisano E', 'Corrias S', 'Orru MG', 'Orru W', 'Velluzzi F', 'Loviselli A']","['Department of Public Health, Section of Psychiatry, University of Cagliari, Italy. bcarpini@iol.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Psychiatry Med,International journal of psychiatry in medicine,0365646,,IM,"['Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/psychology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*epidemiology/psychology/therapy', 'Personality Assessment', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality of Life/*psychology']",,,,,2009/08/05 09:00,2009/08/22 09:00,['2009/08/05 09:00'],"['2009/08/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [medline]']",['10.2190/PM.39.1.e [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Psychiatry Med. 2009;39(1):63-78. doi: 10.2190/PM.39.1.e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Our medical team equipped a mobile health unit, called Vehicle Assisted Nutrition (VAN), with educational material and drove it to seven recreation sites in the Bronx. At these sites, participants completed a short survey, and our staff took body mass index (BMI) measurements. The medical team also distributed patient education materials pertaining to lifestyle modification and obesity. BMI and survey responses were compared and analyzed with statistical software. RESULTS: Obesity rates at these sites averaged 29.9% normal weight, 40.2% overweight, 18% class-1 obese and 11% class-2 obese or greater. Only 22.2% of normal weight, 23.3% of overweight and 43.6% of class-1 obese respondents stated that their weight was a problem (p<0.001). Most (80.6%) of the class-2 obese or greater respondents, however, stated that their weight was a problem (p<0.001). More than 44% of normal weight, 59.4% of overweight, 71.3 of class-1 obese and 90.3% of the class-2 obese or greater participants stated they were willing to do something about it (p=0.006). Of those surveyed, 37.5% of the normal weight, 54.7% of the overweight, 56.9% of the class-1 obese and 63.6% of the class-2 obese or greater indicated that they would like our help (p=0.035). More than 66% of normal weight, 41.8% of the overweight, 56.9% of the class-1 obese, and 68.9% of the class-2 obese or greater stated that they would be interested in a class to lose weight (p=0.008).

To assess their explanatory power, we meta-analyzed 22 brain-activation imaging studies. We found that obese individuals exhibit hyper-responsivity of the brain regions involved in taste and reward for food-related stimuli. Consistent with a Reward Surfeit Hypothesis, obese individuals exhibit a ventral striatum hyper-responsivity in response to pure tastes, particularly when fasting. Furthermore, we found that obese subjects display more frequent ventral striatal activation for visual food cues when satiated: this continued processing within the reward system, together with the aforementioned evidence, is compatible with the Incentive Sensitization Theory. On the other hand, we did not find univocal evidence in favor of a Reward Deficit Hypothesis nor for a systematic deficit of inhibitory cognitive control. We conclude that the available brain activation data on the dysregulated food intake and food-related behavior in chronic obesity can be best framed within an Incentive Sensitization Theory.

Treatment of obesity should be comprehensive and integrated into a multi-component approach and should involve both patients and their families. The main challenge of obesity is maintaining a reduced weight.

Obese dogs, like obese humans, are known to develop resistance to the glucose-lowering effects of insulin, and develop increased circulating concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol and blood pressure. Unlike humans, however, obese dogs do not develop fasting hyperglycaemia or atherogenic hyperlipidaemia. Importantly, there is no evidence that dogs develop type 2 diabetes.

The long-term impact of obesity-related insulin resistance on cardiovascular morbidity in these patients is expected to emerge as these youngsters become young adults.","['Yeste, D', 'Carrascosa, A']","['Yeste D', 'Carrascosa A']","[""Servicio de Pediatria, Unidades de Endocrinologia y Obesidad Pediatrica, Hospital Universitario Vall d' Hebron, Barcelona, Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona, Espana. dyeste@vhebron.net""]",['spa'],['Journal Article'],Spain,An Pediatr (Barc),"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",101162596,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Metabolic Syndrome/*etiology', 'Obesity/*complications/metabolism']",,,,,2011/05/17 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S1695-4033(11)00210-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anpedi.2011.03.025 [doi]']",ppublish,An Pediatr (Barc). 2011 Aug;75(2):135.e1-9. doi: 10.1016/j.anpedi.2011.03.025.

ANIMALS: 36 Retrievers without cardiopulmonary disease. PROCEDURES: Dogs were assigned to 1 of 3 groups on the basis of body condition score (1 through 9): nonobese (score, 4.5 to 5.5), moderately obese (score, 6.0 to 6.5), and markedly obese (score, 7.0 to 9.0). Pulmonary function tests performed in conscious dogs included spirometry and measurement of inspiratory and expiratory airway resistance (R(aw)) and specific R(aw) (sR(aw)) during normal breathing and during hyperpnea via head-out whole-body plethysmography. Functional residual capacity (FRC; measured by use of helium dilution), diffusion capacity of lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and arterial blood gas variables (PaO(2), PaCO(2), and alveolar-arterial gradient) were assessed. RESULTS: During normal breathing, body condition score did not influence airway function, DLCO, or arterial blood gas variables. During hyperpnea, expiratory sR(aw) was significantly greater in markedly obese dogs than nonobese dogs and R(aw) was significantly greater in markedly obese dogs, compared with nonobese and moderately obese dogs. Although not significantly different, markedly obese dogs had a somewhat lower FRC, compared with other dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In dogs, obesity appeared to cause airflow limitation during the expiratory phase of breathing, but this was only evident during hyperpnea. This suggests that flow limitation is dynamic and likely occurs in the distal (rather than proximal) portions of the airways. Further studies are warranted to localize the flow-limited segment and understand whether obesity is linked to exercise intolerance via airway dysfunction in dogs.","['Bach, Jonathan F', 'Rozanski, Elizabeth A', 'Bedenice, Daniela', 'Chan, Daniel L', 'Freeman, Lisa M', 'Lofgren, Jennifer L S', 'Oura, Trisha J', 'Hoffman, Andrew M']","['Bach JF', 'Rozanski EA', 'Bedenice D', 'Chan DL', 'Freeman LM', 'Lofgren JL', 'Oura TJ', 'Hoffman AM']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, Tufts University, North Grafton, MA 01536, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,"['0 (Endothelin-1)', 'B7IN85G1HY (Dinoprost)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dinoprost/pharmacology', 'Dog Diseases/*etiology/*physiopathology', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelin-1/pharmacology', 'Health', 'Obesity/complications/physiopathology/*veterinary', 'Peak Expiratory Flow Rate/*physiology']",,,,,2007/06/05 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2007/06/05 09:00'],"['2007/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2460/ajvr.68.6.670 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2007 Jun;68(6):670-5. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.68.6.670.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Factors that contribute to adolescent obesity are increasingly sedentary behaviors, changes in eating habits and physical activity Body-image perception and peer influence are substantial for adolescents. As a result, knowing the obesity-relatedpsychological impacts in adolescent will be the great benefit for health care providers in taking care of obese adolescents. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact ofobesity has on the behaviors and attitudes regarding self-perception, health outlook, and eating behavior in the mildly obese and the moderately-to-severely obese Thai adolescents. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Participants were obese students who were being followed at the school-based Teen Health Clinic on a regular basis. All participants were followed regularly at their respective school-based Teen Health Clinics. Each participant s percent weight for height was calculated by using Thai National Growth charts. Participants were categorized into 2 groups according to the percent weight for height (% WFH). Those with% WFH below 120% was considered not obese and excluded from the study. The two participating groups were% WFH of 120-140% who are mildly obese (M-O group) and % WFH of greater than 140% who are moderately-severely obese (M-S-O group). A 3-part questionnaire was used to assess the impact of obesity on emotional and psychosocial aspects of each participant, their eating and nutritional attitude and their level of physical activity. RESULTS: Of the 5366 students, grade 7-12 who attended 2 metropolitan Bangkok schools, 678 were diagnosed as overweight or obese. There were 175 obese students who attended the clinic regularly were asked to participate in this study and there were 167 adolescents who completed the questionnaires recruited for this study. Both the M-O and M-S-O groups reported dissatisfaction with their body weight (85.9% and 91.7% respectively) and perceived their need for weight reduction. The M-S-O groups expressed more concerns to lose their weight for medical reasons than the M-O group (52.1% vs. 35.2%, p-value < 0.03). Being obese was shown to have more significant impact to their confidence in M-S-O group than the M-O group (71.9% vs. 50.7%, p < 0.005). The students in M-O group eat lunch regularly otherwise M-S-O group, few of them, skips lunch meal (100% vs. 93.8%, p < 0.032). CONCLUSION: From our study, significant obese adolescents were shown to have poorer self-image with greater prevalence being shown in the significantly obese group.","['In-iw, Supinya', 'Manaboriboon, Boonying', 'Chomchai, Chulathida']","['In-iw S', 'Manaboriboon B', 'Chomchai C']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Asian People', '*Attitude to Health', '*Body Image', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cohort Studies', '*Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Obesity/complications/epidemiology/*psychology', '*Self Concept', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Thailand']",,,,,2010/05/14 06:00,2010/07/23 06:00,['2010/05/14 06:00'],"['2010/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2010 Apr;93(4):429-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 132 children and adolescents (73 males and 59 females) aged 8 - 16, participated in the study. All were studied at the department of Paediatrics, University Hospital of Zaragoza (Spain). Inclusion criteria were the existence of obesity as defined by body mass index (BMI) according to Cole cut-off values (when BMI was higher than the age and sex specific equivalent to 30 kg/m2). The definition of metabolic syndrome was according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Weight (kg), height (cm), waist circumference (cm), blood pressure and BMI were measured. Laboratory determinations after overnight fasting included: transaminases (ALT, AST, GGT), fasting glucose, insulin, triglycerides and HDL-C. The MS was found in 21.6% of the obese children and adolescents and the prevalence was higher in males (25.9%) than in females (15.9%). Serum transaminases (ALT, AST and GGT) mean concentrations were higher in males than in females, and decreased during pubertal development. The obese children and adolescents with the MS did not show higher transaminases concentrations when compared with those without the MS. Some MS manifestations (mainly waist circumference) showed a correlation with ALT, although all transaminases values were normal according to adult references. Liver transaminases, a surrogate marker of NAFLD, did not show an early and consistent manifestation of abnormalities in the obese children and adolescents studied. In order to define the presence of the disease, it would be necessary to obtain aminotransferase reference standards for children and adolescents, considering pubertal stage and gender.","['Gonzalez-Gil, E M', 'Bueno-Lozano, G', 'Bueno-Lozano, O', 'Moreno, L A', 'Cuadron-Andres, L', 'Huerta-Blas, P', 'Garagorri, J M', 'Bueno, M']","['Gonzalez-Gil EM', 'Bueno-Lozano G', 'Bueno-Lozano O', 'Moreno LA', 'Cuadron-Andres L', 'Huerta-Blas P', 'Garagorri JM', 'Bueno M']","['Growth, Exercise, Nutrition and Development (GENUD) Research Group, University of Zaragoza, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Spain,J Physiol Biochem,Journal of physiology and biochemistry,9812509,['EC 2.6.1.- (Transaminases)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*blood/*enzymology/epidemiology', 'Transaminases/*metabolism']",,,,,2009/07/11 09:00,2009/07/30 09:00,['2009/07/11 09:00'],"['2009/07/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/BF03165969 [doi]'],ppublish,J Physiol Biochem. 2009 Mar;65(1):51-9. doi: 10.1007/BF03165969.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Auricularia heimuer is rich in active substances that have potential biologically active functions. The anti-obesity effect and mechanism of Auricularia heimuer fruiting body alcohol extraction (AHA, 150-600 mg/kg.bw) was investigated in obese mice by assessing changes in endogenous liver metabolites using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach. The aim of this study was to identify an effective food to control human obesity. AHA of 600 mg/kg.bw (HC) significantly decreased body weight and improved serum biochemistry indices. Sixty-eight liver metabolites were identified and significantly separated among the normal, high-fat diet (HFD), and HC groups. Moreover, the metabolic analysis revealed that HC significantly regulated specific metabolites in mice including amino acids, lipids, and carbohydrate compounds. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis revealed that HC was significantly involved in different metabolite pathways including arachidonic acid metabolism, galactose metabolism, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, linoleic acid metabolism, and starch and sucrose metabolism. Eight weeks after supplementing with HC, major metabolites in related pathways that were disrupted by an HFD were restored to normal levels, suggesting that HC had anti-obesity activity.","['Yang, Juan', 'Zhou, Tianfeng', 'Huang, Linxiang', 'Chen, Bingzhi', 'Jiang, Yuji']","['Yang J', 'Zhou T', 'Huang L', 'Chen B', 'Jiang Y']","['College of Food Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China.', 'College of Food Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China.', 'College of Food Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China.', 'College of Food Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China.', 'College of Food Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Food Biochem,Journal of food biochemistry,7706045,['Auricularia heimuer'],IM,"['Animals', 'Auricularia', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Mice', 'Mice, Obese', '*Obesity/etiology/genetics', '*Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Auricularia heimuer', 'alcohol extraction', 'high-fat diet', 'metabolites analysis']",,2021/12/02 06:00,2022/03/11 06:00,['2021/12/01 07:39'],"['2021/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/03/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/01 07:39 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jfbc.14002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Food Biochem. 2022 Jan;46(1):e14002. doi: 10.1111/jfbc.14002.

Current prevalence data from individual national studies suggest that the obesity prevalence in the European countries ranges from 10% to 20% for men, and 10% to 25% for women. Health consequences of obesity imply both a number of fatal and non-fatal health problems (out of which the most common are cardiovascular problems, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, cancers), and also a wide spectrum of psychological consequences from diminished self-esteem to clinical depression. Causal relationship between obesity and many chronic diseases is evidence-based. At the same time, there are marked differences in research data regarding causal obesity-depression relationship. Several studies have found no direct association between obesity and depression, while in others the prevalence of depression in obese patients was up to 50%. Gender, obesity grade, socioeconomic status and asking for professional help are named as moderators and mediators of this relationship. Among recommended screening methods, BDI-II is the most frequently used in the adult outpatient departments. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine possible risk factors of depression in adult obese patients treated for obesity. Gender, obesity and education level as well as marital status were analyzed as possible moderators of depression-obesity relationship. METHOD: The research included 267 patients, 38.0 +/- 14.6 years of age, who referred to the Outpatient Nutrition Department for dietetic consultation or nutritional medical therapy. Nutritional status was assessed by BMI (kg/m2), calculated from measured values of body weight and height according to WHO recommendations. An estimate of the existence and/or depression level was investigated by Beck Depression Inventory--self-administered questionnaire recommended for use in Serbian population. RESULTS: The results revealed higher average BDI score values in obese patients (F(267,1) = 6.014, p = 0.015) in comparison to their non-obese counterparts. In addition, the percentage of depressive obese patients was significantly higher (55.1%, chi2(267.1) = 22.64, p < 0.001). There was significant correlation of BMI and BDI scores (r = 0.246, p < 0.001). The number of women with depression was significantly higher in comparison to men (chi2(267.1) = 4.261, p = 0.039). Women also had higher average BDI score (p = 0.003). MANOVA showed that BDI score was influenced by gender (F(267.1) = 8.936, p = 0.030) and nutritional status (F(267.1) = 6.115, p = 0.014), but combined effect of the above-mentioned moderators was not significant. CONCLUSION: Depression is ten times more frequent in obese patients undergoing the obesity treatment vs. general population and, therefore, screening for depression is needed. Special attention should be paid to women and more obese patients due to higher incidence of depression in these groups.","['Gudelj-Radic, Jelena', 'Davidovic, Dragana', 'Avramovic, Dusan', 'Backovic, Dusan', 'Jorga, Jagoda']","['Gudelj-Radic J', 'Davidovic D', 'Avramovic D', 'Backovic D', 'Jorga J']",,['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,,IM,"['Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Depressive Disorder/*complications/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*psychology/therapy']",,,,,2007/05/17 09:00,2007/06/23 09:00,['2007/05/17 09:00'],"['2007/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2298/sarh0702061g [doi]'],ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2007 Jan-Feb;135(1-2):61-6. doi: 10.2298/sarh0702061g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Development of obesity is associated with extensive modifications in adipose tissue involving adipogenesis, angiogenesis and extracellular matrix proteolysis. The fibrinolytic (plasminogen/plasmin) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) systems cooperate in these processes. Adipogenesis is tightly associated with angiogenesis, as shown by the findings that adipose tissue expiants trigger blood vessel formation, whereas in turn adipose tissue endothelial cells promote preadipocyte differentiation. A nutritionally induced obesity model in transgenic mice has been used extensively to study the role of the fibrinolytic and MMP systems and of angiogenesis in the development of obesity. Most studies support a role of these systems in adipogenesis and obesity, and suggest that their modulation may affect development of adipose tissue. Such models have also shown that treatment of obese female mice with estrogens has the potential to improve obesity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, via decreased expression of lipogenic genes. Thus, murine models of obesity have been very useful tools to study mechanisms of adipose tissue development, as well as effects of hormonal therapy.","['Lijnen, H R']",['Lijnen HR'],"['Center for Molecular and Vascular Biology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. roger.lijnen@med.kuleuven.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (Hormones)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",IM,"['Adipogenesis', 'Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Hormones/*therapeutic use', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Obese', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'Obesity/*drug therapy/metabolism/*physiopathology']",,,,,2011/01/26 06:00,2011/05/14 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0049-3848(11)70006-8 [pii]', '10.1016/S0049-3848(11)70006-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2011 Feb;127 Suppl 3:S17-20. doi: 10.1016/S0049-3848(11)70006-8.,,,,['(c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Although evidence suggests that obesity is associated with comorbidity, disability, and mortality in older persons, such relationship has rarely been explored in the nursing home population and research is still mainly conducted in community-dwelling people. METHODS: A review of the literature identified 11 suitable papers that discuss current knowledge about the management of obesity in nursing home. RESULTS: The specificity of the obese nursing home residents is often to be disabled survivors of previous complications related to obesity with short life expectancy. Whether nutritional treatment and physical activity can improve clinical condition and quality of life in the obese remains an open question. Strengths and weaknesses of current methodologies in the assessment of adiposity are needed to be carefully considered, especially in a clinical setting with limited resources. CONCLUSIONS: More investigations are required to understand obesity as a risk factor for institutionalization and a criterion of non-admission in nursing home at the same time. Although difficulties to implement these approaches are present, effective and feasible treatments for obesity should be tested.","['Zanandrea, Valeria', 'Barreto de Souto, Philippe', 'Cesari, Matteo', 'Vellas, Bruno', 'Rolland, Yves']","['Zanandrea V', 'Barreto de Souto P', 'Cesari M', 'Vellas B', 'Rolland Y']","['Clinica Geriatrica, University of Verona, Italy; Gerontopole de Toulouse, Institut du Vieillissement, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire de Toulouse, France.

Cardiac surgery patients have a higher incidence of difficult airway and difficult laryngoscopy than general surgery patients do, and obesity is associated with difficult mask ventilation and direct laryngoscopy. Positioning injuries occur more frequently because obese patients are at greater risk of pressure injury, such as rhabdomyolysis and compartment syndrome. Despite the association between obesity and several chronic disease states, the effects of obesity on perioperative outcomes are conflicting. Studies examining outcomes of overweight and obese patients in cardiac surgery have reported varying results. An ""obesity paradox"" has been described, in which the mortality for overweight and obese patients is lower compared with patients of normal weight. This review describes the physiologic abnormalities and clinical implications of obesity in cardiac surgery and summarizes recommendations for anesthesiologists to optimize perioperative care of the obese cardiac surgical patient.","['Chacon, M Megan', 'Cheruku, Sreekanth R', 'Neuburger, Peter J', 'Lester, Laeben', 'Shillcutt, Sasha K']","['Chacon MM', 'Cheruku SR', 'Neuburger PJ', 'Lester L', 'Shillcutt SK']","['University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.
