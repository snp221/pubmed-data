AVP deficiency leads to the inability to concentrate urine and excessive renal water losses, resulting in a clinical syndrome of hypotonic polyuria with compensatory thirst. CDI is caused by diverse etiologies, although it typically develops due to neoplastic, traumatic, or autoimmune destruction of AVP-synthesizing/secreting neurons. This review focuses on the diagnosis and management of CDI, providing insights into the physiological disturbances underpinning the syndrome. Recent developments in diagnostic techniques, particularly the development of the copeptin assay, have improved accuracy and acceptability of the diagnostic approach to the hypotonic polyuria syndrome. We discuss the management of CDI with particular emphasis on management of fluid intake and pharmacological replacement of AVP. Specific clinical syndromes such as adipsic diabetes insipidus and diabetes insipidus in pregnancy as well as management of the perioperative patient with diabetes insipidus are also discussed.","['(c) The Author(s) 2022.

In this study, we review the clinical aspects and diagnosis of NDI, the various etiologies, current treatment options and potential future developments. NDI has different clinical manifestations and approaches according to the etiology. Hereditary forms of NDI are mainly caused by mutations in the genes that encode key proteins in the AVP signaling pathway, while acquired causes are normally associated with specific drug exposure, especially lithium, and hydroelectrolytic disorders. Clinical manifestations of the disease vary according to the degree of dehydration and hyperosmolality, being worse when renal water losses cannot be properly compensated by fluid intake. Regarding the diagnosis of NDI, it is important to consider the symptoms of the patient and the diagnostic tests, including the water deprivation test and the baseline plasma copeptin measurement, a stable surrogate biomarker of AVP release. Without proper treatment, patients may developcomplications leading to high morbidity and mortality, such as severe dehydration and hypernatremia. In that sense, the treatment of NDI consists in decreasing the urine output, while allowing appropriate fluid balance, normonatremia, and ensuring an acceptable quality of life. Therefore, therapeutic options include nonpharmacological interventions, including sufficient water intake and a low-sodium diet, and pharmacological treatment. The main medications used for NDI are thiazide diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and amiloride, used isolated or in combination.","['(c) 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.']","['Vaz de Castro, Pedro Alves Soares', 'Bitencourt, Leticia', 'de Oliveira Campos, Juliana Lacerda', 'Fischer, Bruna Luisa', 'Soares de Brito, Stephanie Bruna Camilo', 'Soares, Beatriz Santana', 'Drummond, Juliana Beaudette', 'Simoes E Silva, Ana Cristina']","['Vaz de Castro PAS', 'Bitencourt L', 'de Oliveira Campos JL', 'Fischer BL', 'Soares de Brito SBC', 'Soares BS', 'Drummond JB', 'Simoes E Silva AC']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9222-3882'],"['Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Medical Investigation, Unit of Pediatric Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Medical Investigation, Unit of Pediatric Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Medical Investigation, Unit of Pediatric Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Medical Investigation, Unit of Pediatric Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Medical Investigation, Unit of Pediatric Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UFMG, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UFMG, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Medical Investigation, Unit of Pediatric Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,9508900,['113-79-1 (Arginine Vasopressin)'],IM,"['Arginine Vasopressin/genetics', '*Diabetes Insipidus', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Nephrogenic/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', '*Diabetes Mellitus', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Polyuria/diagnosis', 'Quality of Life']",,['NOTNLM'],"['arginine vasopressin', 'copeptin', 'diuretics', 'nephrogenic diabetes insipidus', 'polyuria-polydipsia syndrome', 'water deprivation test']",2022/02/12 06:00,2022/04/02 06:00,['2022/02/11 05:49'],"['2021/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2022/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2022/02/11 05:49 [entrez]']","['jpem-2021-0566 [pii]', '10.1515/jpem-2021-0566 [doi]']",epublish,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2022 Feb 11;35(4):421-434. doi: 10.1515/jpem-2021-0566.

Most patients develop the disease as a result of hypothalamic destruction from a variety of underlying etiologies. Damage to osmolar-responsive neuroreceptors, primarily within the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, results in impaired production and release of arginine vasopressin (AVP). Important regulating circuits of thirst sense and drive are regionally colocalized with AVP centers and therefore are also injured. Patients with central diabetes insipidus with impaired thirst response, defined as ADI, suffer from wide swings of plasma osmolality resulting in repeated hospitalization, numerous associated comorbidities, and significant mortality. Treatment recommendations are based largely on expert advice from case series owing to the rarity of disease prevalence. Acute disease management focuses on fixed dosing of antidiuretic hormone analogues and calculated prescriptions of obligate daily water intake.

Diabetes Insipidus is a complex and heterogeneous clinical syndrome affecting water balance and characterized by constant diuresis, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine. With respect to the similarly named Diabetes Mellitus, a disease already known in ancient Egypt, Greece and Asia, Diabetes Insipidus has been described several thousand years later. In 1670s Thomas Willis, noted the difference in taste of urine from polyuric subjects compared with healthy individuals and started the differentiation of Diabetes Mellitus from the more rare entity of Diabetes Insipidus. In 1794, Johann Peter Frank described polyuric patients excreting nonsaccharine urine and introduced the term of Diabetes Insipidus. An hystorical milestone was the in 1913, when Farini successfully used posterior pituitary extracts to treat Diabetes Insipidus. Until 1920s the available evidence indicated Diabetes Insipidus as a disorder of the pituitary gland. In the early 1928, De Lange first observed that some patients with Diabetes Insipidus did not respond to posterior pituitary extracts and subsequently Forssman and Waring in 1945 established that the kidney had a critical role for these forms of Diabetes Insipidus resistant to this treatment. In 1947 Williams and Henry introduced the term Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus for the congenital syndrome characterized by polyuria and renal concentrating defect resistant to vasopressin.

Autoimmune CDI should be considered in the differential diagnosis of idiopathic CDI and also of mass lesions of the sella region. An autoimmune etiology of CDI was first suggested in 1983 by the detection of autoantibodies to hypothalamic vasopressin-producing cells (AVPcAb) in adults and also in children with the disease, using the indirect immunofluorescence test. The major autoantigen for autoimmune CDI has now been recognized as rabphilin-3A, a protein of secretory vesicles of the neurohypophyseal system. The detection of autoantibodies to rabphilin-3A by Western blotting or of AVPcAb provides strong evidence for the diagnosis of autoimmune CDI. Autoimmune CDI is recognized mostly in patients who had also been diagnosed with endocrine autoimmune disorders. The radiological and morphological correlate with autoimmune DI is lymphocytic infundibuloneurohypophysitis (LINH) as detected by magnetic resonance imaging and biopsies that show massive infiltration of the posterior pituitary and the infundibulum with lymphocytes and some plasma cells, and fibrosis in the later stages of the disease.

However, it is most frequently transient. It is defined by the excretion of an abnormally large volume of dilute urine with increasing serum osmolality. The reported incidence of CDI after pituitary surgery ranges from 0-90%. Large tumour size, gross total resection and intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak usually pose an increased risk of CDI as observed with craniopharyngioma and Rathke's cleft cysts. CDI can be associated with high morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognised and treated on time. It is also essential to rule out other causes of postoperative polyuria to avoid unnecessary pharmacotherapy and iatrogenic hyponatremia. Once the diagnosis of CDI is established, close monitoring is required to evaluate the response to treatment and to determine whether the CDI is transient or permanent. This review outlines the evaluation and management of patients with CDI following pituitary and suprasellar tumour surgery to help recognise the diagnosis, consider the differential diagnosis, initiate therapeutic interventions and guide monitoring and long-term management.","['(c) Copyright 2021, Sultan Qaboos University Medical Journal, All Rights Reserved.']","['Almalki, Mussa H', 'Ahmad, Maswood M', 'Brema, Imad', 'Almehthel, Mohammed', 'AlDahmani, Khaled M', 'Mahzari, Moeber', 'Beshyah, Salem A']","['Almalki MH', 'Ahmad MM', 'Brema I', 'Almehthel M', 'AlDahmani KM', 'Mahzari M', 'Beshyah SA']",,"['Obesity, Endocrine and Metabolism Centre, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, King Saud Bin Abdul Aziz University of Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Obesity, Endocrine and Metabolism Centre, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Obesity, Endocrine and Metabolism Centre, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Obesity, Endocrine and Metabolism Centre, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Division of Endocrinology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Tawam Hospital, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.', 'Department of Medicine, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.', 'Faculty of Medicine, King Saud Bin Abdul Aziz University of Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medicine, Ministry of National Guard Health Affair, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medicine, Dubai Medical College, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Mediclinic Airport Road, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Oman,Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J,Sultan Qaboos University medical journal,101519915,,IM,"['*Diabetes Insipidus/diagnosis/etiology', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic', '*Diabetes Mellitus', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms']",PMC8407907,['NOTNLM'],"['Arginine Vasopressin', 'Central Diabetes Insipidus', 'Desmopressin', 'Pituitary Adenoma', 'Pituitary Surgery', 'Polydipsia', 'Polyuria', 'Preoperative Risk Factor', 'Treatment']",2021/09/16 06:00,2021/09/18 06:00,['2021/09/15 07:16'],"['2020/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/15 07:16 [entrez]', '2021/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['squmj2108-354-364 [pii]', '10.18295/squmj.4.2021.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J. 2021 Aug;21(3):354-364. doi: 10.18295/squmj.4.2021.010.

It binds to AVP receptor 2 in the kidney to promote the insertion of aquaporin channels (AQP2) and antidiuretic responses. AVP secretion deficits produce central diabetes insipidus (CDI), while renal insensitivity to the antidiuretic effect of AVP causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). Hereditary and acquired forms of CDI and NDI generate hypotonic polyuria, polydipsia, hyperosmolality, and hypernatremia. The AVP mutant (Brattleboro) rat is the principal animal model of hereditary CDI, while neurohypophysectomy, pituitary stalk compression, hypophysectomy, and mediobasal hypothalamic lesions produce acquired CDI. In animals, hereditary NDI is mainly caused by mutations in AVP2R or AQP2 genes, while acquired NDI is most frequently induced by lithium. We report here on the determinants of the intake and excretion of water and mineral salts and on the different types of DI in humans. We then describe the hydromineral characteristics of these animal models and the responses observed after administration of hypertonic NaCl or when they are fed with low-sodium diets. Finally, we report on the effects of drugs such as AVP analogues and/or oxytocin, another neuropeptide that increases sodium excretion in animal models and humans with CDI, and sildenafil, a compound that increases the expression and function of AQP2 channels in animal models and humans with NDI.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The differential diagnosis is challenging and requires a detailed medical history, physical examination, biochemical approach, imaging studies, and, in some cases, histological confirmation. Magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard method for evaluating congenital or acquired cerebral and pituitary stalk lesions. Pituitary stalk size at presentation could be normal, but it may change over time, depending on the underlying condition, while other brain areas or organs may become involved during follow-up. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to avoid central nervous system damage and germ cell tumor dissemination and to minimize complications of multiple pituitary hormone defects. We provide a practical update on the diagnosis and management of patients with CDI and highlight several pitfalls that may complicate the differential diagnosis of conditions presenting with polyuria and polydipsia. The need for a careful and close follow-up of patients with apparently idiopathic CDI is particularly emphasized because the underlying condition may be recognized over time. The clinical scenario that we outline at the beginning of this article represents the basis for the discussion about how the etiological diagnosis of CDI can be overlooked and demonstrates how a water intake and urine output improvement can be a sign of progressive damage of both hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland with associated pituitary hormonal deficiencies.","['(c) The Author(s) 2022.

Data on treatment-associated side-effects, psychological comorbidities, and incorrect management are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate patients' perspectives on their disease. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional, web-based, anonymous survey, developed by endocrinologists and patient representatives, to collect the opinions of patients with central diabetes insipidus on management and complications of their disease, psychological comorbidities, degree of knowledge and awareness of the condition among health-care professionals, and renaming the disease to avoid confusion with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). FINDINGS: Between Aug 23, 2021, and Feb 7, 2022, 1034 patients with central diabetes insipidus participated in the survey. 91 (9%) participants were children and adolescents (37 [41%] girls and 54 [59%] boys; median age 10 years [IQR 6-15]) and 943 (91%) were adults (757 [80%] women and 186 [20%] men]; median age 44 years [34-54]). 488 (47%) participants had isolated posterior pituitary dysfunction and 546 (53%) had combined anterior and posterior pituitary dysfunction. Main aetiologies were idiopathic (315 [30%] of 1034 participants) and tumours and cysts (pre-surgical 217 [21%]; post-surgical 254 [25%]). 260 (26%; 95% CI [0.23-0.29]) of 994 patients on desmopressin therapy had hyponatraemia leading to hospitalisation. Patients who routinely omitted or delayed desmopressin to allow intermittent aquaresis had a significantly lower prevalence of hyponatraemia compared with those not aware of this approach (odds ratio 0.55 [95% CI 0.39-0.77]; p=0.0006). Of patients who had to be hospitalised for any medical reason, 71 (13%; 95% CI 0.10-0.16) of 535 patients did not receive desmopressin while in a fasting state (nil by mouth) without intravenous fluid replacement and reported symptoms of dehydration. 660 (64%; 0.61-0.67) participants reported lower quality of life, and 369 (36%; 0.33-0.39) had psychological changes subjectively associated with their central diabetes insipidus. 823 (80%; 0.77-0.82) participants encountered a situation where central diabetes insipidus was confused with diabetes mellitus (diabetes) by health-care professionals. 884 (85%; 0.83-0.88) participants supported renaming the disease; the most favoured alternative names were vasopressin deficiency and arginine vasopressin deficiency. INTERPRETATION: This is the largest survey of patients with central diabetes insipidus, reporting a high prevalence of treatment-associated side-effects, mismanagement during hospitalisation, psychological comorbidities, and a clear support for renaming the disease. Our data are the first to indicate the value of routinely omitting or delaying desmopressin.

Central DI (CDI), better now referred to as arginine vasopressin (AVP)-deficiency, is the most common form of DI resulting from deficiency of the hormone AVP from the pituitary. The less common nephrogenic DI (NDI) or AVP-resistance develops secondary to AVP resistance in the kidneys. The majority of causes of DI are acquired, with CDI developing when more than 80% of AVP-secreting neurons are damaged. Inherited/familial CDI causes account for approximately 1% of cases. Although the pathogenesis of NDI is unclear, more than 280 disease-causing mutations affecting the AVP2 protein or AVP V2 receptor, as well as in aquaporin 2 (AQP2), have been described. Although the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway remains the major regulatory pathway of AVP/AQP2 action, in vitro data have also revealed additional cAMP independent pathways of NDI pathogenesis. Diagnosing partial forms of DI, and distinguishing them from primary polydipsia, can be challenging, previously necessitating the use of the water deprivation test. However, measurements of circulating copeptin levels, especially after stimulation, are increasingly replacing the classical tests in clinical practice because of their ease of use and high sensitivity and specificity. The treatment of CDI relies on desmopressin administration, whereas NDI requires the management of any underlying diseases, removal of offending drugs and, in some cases, administration of diuretics.

It is characterized by polydipsia and polyuria (urine output >30mL/kg/day in adults and >2l/m(2)/24h in children) of dilute urine (<250mOsm/L). It can result from any pathology affecting one or more components of the HNS including the hypothalamic osmoreceptors, supraoptic or paraventricular nuclei, and median eminence of the hypothalamus, infundibulum, stalk or the posterior pituitary gland. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA), and a dedicated pituitary or sella protocol is essential. CT can provide complimentary diagnostic information and is also of value when MRI is contraindicated. The most common causes are benign or malignant neoplasia of the HPA (25%), surgery (20%), and head trauma (16%). No cause is identified in up to 30% of cases, classified as idiopathic CDI. Knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the HNS is crucial when evaluating a patient with CDI. Establishing the etiology of CDI with MRI in combination with clinical and biochemical assessment facilitates appropriate targeted treatment.

The most reliable approaches are copeptin measurements after hypertonic saline infusion or arginine, which is a known growth hormone secretagogue but has recently also been shown to stimulate the neurohypophysis. Similar to arginine, glucagon stimulates growth hormone release, but its effect on the neurohypophysis is poorly studied. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial including 22 healthy participants, 10 patients with central diabetes insipidus, and 10 patients with primary polydipsia at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. METHODS: Each participant underwent the glucagon test (s.c. injection of 1 mg glucagon) and placebo test. The primary objective was to determine whether glucagon stimulates copeptin and to explore whether the copeptin response differentiates between diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. Copeptin levels were measured at baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after injection. RESULTS: In healthy participants, glucagon stimulated copeptin with a median increase of 7.56 (2.38; 28.03) pmol/L, while placebo had no effect (0.10 pmol/L (-0.70; 0.68); P < 0.001). In patients with diabetes insipidus, copeptin showed no relevant increase upon glucagon, with an increase of 0.55 (0.21; 1.65) pmol/L, whereas copeptin was stimulated in patients with primary polydipsia with an increase of 15.70 (5.99; 24.39) pmol/L. Using a copeptin cut-off level of 4.6pmol/L had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 100-100) and a specificity of 90% (95% CI: 70-100) to discriminate between diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. CONCLUSION: Glucagon stimulates the neurohypophysis, and glucagon-stimulated copeptin has the potential for a safe, novel, and precise test in the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus.",,"['Atila, Cihan', 'Gaisl, Odile', 'Vogt, Deborah R', 'Werlen, Laura', 'Szinnai, Gabor', 'Christ-Crain, Mirjam']","['Atila C', 'Gaisl O', 'Vogt DR', 'Werlen L', 'Szinnai G', 'Christ-Crain M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5442-7304', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6336-0965']","['Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', ""Department of Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology, University Children's Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Eur J Endocrinol,European journal of endocrinology,9423848,"['0 (Glycopeptides)', '0 (copeptins)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', '9007-92-5 (Glucagon)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Arginine', '*Diabetes Insipidus/diagnosis', '*Diabetes Mellitus/diagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Glucagon', 'Glycopeptides', 'Growth Hormone', 'Humans', '*Polydipsia, Psychogenic/diagnosis']",,,,2022/05/07 06:00,2022/05/18 06:00,['2022/05/06 06:53'],"['2022/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2022/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/18 06:00 [medline]', '2022/05/06 06:53 [entrez]']",['10.1530/EJE-22-0033 [doi]'],epublish,Eur J Endocrinol. 2022 May 12;187(1):65-74. doi: 10.1530/EJE-22-0033.,20220512,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can be caused by any of four fundamentally different abnormalities: deficient production of the antidiuretic hormone, arginine vasopressin (AVP) by magnocellular neurons that form the posterior pituitary (hypothalamic DI); impaired renal effects of AVP (nephrogenic DI); reduced AVP secretion due to excessive water intake (primary polydipsia); or degradation of AVP by placental vasopressinase (gestational DI). Each type of DI can be caused or potentiated by other disorders. Hypothalamic and nephrogenic DI can also be caused by mutation of the gene that encodes the AVP prohormone, the AVP-2 receptors in the kidney, or the aquaporin-2 water channels that mediate antidiuresis. Familial hypothalamic DI is usually transmitted in an autosomal dominant mode, but autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive forms also exist. Familial nephrogenic DI is usually transmitted in an X-linked recessive mode but can also be autosomal recessive or dominant. Hence the mode of inheritance does not always indicate the type of DI. Indirect methods of differential diagnosis are also unreliable and the pituitary MRI signal is diminished in both types of familial DI.

In otherwise healthy patients with DI, normal thirst mechanism, and free access to water, the thirst system can maintain plasma osmolality in the near-normal range. However, in cases where DI presents with adipsia, cognitive impairment, or restricted access to water, true hypernatremia may occur, leading to severe morbidity and mortality. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 2-year-old boy who had global developmental delay and post-brain debulking surgery involving the hypothalamic region, which resulted in central DI and thirst center dysfunction. We describe the clinical presentation, the current understanding of adipsic DI, and a new practical approach for management. The main guidelines of treatment include (1) fixed desmopressin dosing that allows minimal urinary breakthroughs in-between the doses; (2) timely diaper weight-based replacement of water; (3) bodyweight-based fluid correction 2 times a day, and (4) providing the nutritional and water requirements in a way similar to any healthy child but at fixed time intervals.

The highest risk of diabetes insipidus is observed after resection of craniopharyngioma, Rathke's cleft cyst and ACTH-releasing pituitary microadenoma. This review is devoted to prevalence and predictors of diabetes insipidus after resection of sellar-suprasellar tumors.",,"['Badmaeva, I N', 'Astafieva, L I', 'Kalinin, P L', 'Kadashev, B A', 'Kutin, M A']","['Badmaeva IN', 'Astafieva LI', 'Kalinin PL', 'Kadashev BA', 'Kutin MA']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2211-4298', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4480-1902', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9333-9473', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6520-4296']","['Burdenko Neurosurgical Center, Moscow, Russia.', 'Burdenko Neurosurgical Center, Moscow, Russia.', 'Burdenko Neurosurgical Center, Moscow, Russia.', 'Burdenko Neurosurgical Center, Moscow, Russia.', 'Burdenko Neurosurgical Center, Moscow, Russia.']",['rus'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Russia (Federation),Zh Vopr Neirokhir Im N N Burdenko,Zhurnal voprosy neirokhirurgii imeni N.

Regulating water metabolism is critically important. Diabetes insipidus (DI) presented with excessive water loss from the kidney is a major disorder of water metabolism. To understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms and pathophysiology of DI and rationales of clinical management of DI is important for both research and clinical practice. This chapter will first review various forms of DI focusing on central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). This is followed by a discussion of regulatory mechanisms underlying CDI and NDI, with a focus on the regulatory axis of vasopressin, vasopressin receptor 2 (V2R) and the water channel molecule, aquaporin 2 (AQP2). The clinical manifestation, diagnosis, and management of various forms of DI will also be discussed with highlights of some of the latest therapeutic strategies that are developed from in vitro experiments and animal studies.","['(c) 2023.

A 16-year-old boy entered to a medical facility in coma (GCS score 6) with the following diagnosis: acute TBI, severe cerebral contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, depressed comminuted cranial vault fracture, basilar skull fracture, visceral contusion. CDI was diagnosed in 3 days after injury considering polyuria and hypernatremia (155 mmol/l). Desmopressin therapy was initiated through a feeding tube. Thirst appeared when a patient came out of the coma after 21 days despite ongoing desmopressin therapy. Considering persistent thirst and polyuria, we continued desmopressin therapy in a spray form. Under this therapy, polyuria reduced to 3-3.5 liters per a day. Symptoms of CDI persisted in long-term period (2 years after TBI) while function of adenohypophysis was intact. This case demonstrates a rare development of permanent diabetes insipidus after TBI. CDI manifested only as polyuria and hypernatremia in coma. Thirst joined after recovery of consciousness.

It is a chronic condition which usually requires meticulous long-term care. It can affect both children and adults. There is limited literature considering the needs and challenges inherent in providing high quality care to patients with CDI, across the care pathway. This paper seeks to address this gap by providing a unique and well-rounded understanding of clinical and healthcare systems-related challenges. It draws on insights from the literature, from direct clinical experience contributed by five clinicians as co-authors (providing insights from France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), and from patient perspectives provided through interviews with patient representatives from three patient organisations. We identify clinical challenges related to the diagnosis of CDI, including differentiating between other similar conditions and determining the underlying aetiology. Treatment is challenging, given the need to tailor medication to each patient's needs and ongoing management is required to ensure that patients continue to respond adequately to treatment. Ongoing support is required when patients switch between formulations. We also identify healthcare systems challenges related to limited awareness of CDI amongst primary care physicians and general paediatricians, and the need for highly skilled specialist care and appropriate workforce capacity. There is also a significant need for raising awareness and for the education of both healthcare professionals and patients about different aspects of CDI, with the aim of supporting improved care and effective patient engagement with healthcare professionals. We reflect on this information and highlight improvement opportunities. These relate to developing guidance to support patients, carers, primary care physicians and general paediatricians to identify clinical features earlier, and to consider CDI as a possible diagnosis when a patient presents with suggestive symptoms.",['(c) 2022.

Classical WS features are childhood-onset diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, deafness, diabetes insipidus, neurological signs, and other abnormalities. Two causative genes (WFS1 and WFS2) have been identified. The transmission of the disease takes place in an autosomal recessive mode but autosomal dominant mutations responsible for WS-related disorders have been described. Prognosis is poor, death occurs at the median age of 39 years with a major cause represented by respiratory failure as a consequence of brain stem atrophy and neurodegeneration. The aim of this narrative review is to focus on etiology, pathogenesis and natural history of WS for an adequate patient management and for the discussion of future therapeutic interventions. MAIN BODY: WS requires a multidisciplinary approach in order to be successfully treated. A prompt diagnosis decreases morbidity and mortality through prevention and treatment of complications. Being a monogenic pathology, WS represents a perfect model to study the mechanisms of ER stress and how this condition leads to cell death, in comparison with other prevalent diseases in which multiple factors interact to produce the disease manifestations. WS is also an important disease prototype to identify drugs and molecules associated with ER homeostasis. Evidence indicates that specific metabolic diseases (type 1 and type 2 diabetes), neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis, inflammatory pathologies and also cancer are closely related to ER dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic strategies in WS are based on drug repurposing (i.e., investigation of approved drugs for novel therapeutic indications) with the aim to stop the progression of the disease by reducing the endoplasmic reticulum stress. An extensive understanding of WS from pathophysiology to therapy is fundamental and more studies are necessary to better manage this devastating disease and guarantee the patients a better quality of life and longer life expectancy.",,"['Pallotta, Maria Teresa', 'Tascini, Giorgia', 'Crispoldi, Roberta', 'Orabona, Ciriana', 'Mondanelli, Giada', 'Grohmann, Ursula', 'Esposito, Susanna']","['Pallotta MT', 'Tascini G', 'Crispoldi R', 'Orabona C', 'Mondanelli G', 'Grohmann U', 'Esposito S']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4103-2837'],"['Pharmacology Section, Department of Experimental Medicine, Universita degli Studi di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Clinic, Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, Universita degli Studi di Perugia, Piazza Menghini 1, 06129, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Clinic, Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, Universita degli Studi di Perugia, Piazza Menghini 1, 06129, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pharmacology Section, Department of Experimental Medicine, Universita degli Studi di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pharmacology Section, Department of Experimental Medicine, Universita degli Studi di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pharmacology Section, Department of Experimental Medicine, Universita degli Studi di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Clinic, Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, Universita degli Studi di Perugia, Piazza Menghini 1, 06129, Perugia, Italy. susanna.esposito@unimi.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (wolframin protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/complications/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Development', 'Drug Repositioning', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, Recessive', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/complications/*diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Quality of Life', 'Wolfram Syndrome/complications/*diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Young Adult']",PMC6651977,['NOTNLM'],"['Deafness', 'Diabetes insipidus', 'Optic atrophy', 'Type 1 diabetes', 'WFS1', 'WFS2', 'Wolfram syndrome']",2019/07/25 06:00,2020/07/10 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-019-1993-1 [pii]', '1993 [pii]', '10.1186/s12967-019-1993-1 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2019 Jul 23;17(1):238. doi: 10.1186/s12967-019-1993-1.,20190723,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the last few years, a spirited campaign spear-headed by the families of affected individuals has made progress in educating nonprofessional and medical communities about diabetes insipidus (DI), the other disease characterized by polyuria (i.e., diabetes). Much work lies ahead to find better treatments for this affliction, but the progress in molecular biology over the last years made possible the identification of the genetic defects underlying the inherited forms of the disease. Numerous cases of adult-onset DI are triggered by toxic damage to the kidneys that impairs the concentrating capacity of the nephrons by a nonspecific mechanism. In these pages I shall deal mostly with the inherited forms of the disease. Diabetes insipidus is characterized by the inability of the kidneys of affected individuals to produce concentrated urine (Morello and Bichet 2001). The elimination of large volumes of diluted urine (polyuria) and excessive thirst (polydipsia) are the chief symptoms of the disease. Although this condition and the hints that it was a hereditary disease were described at the end of the 19th century, it took almost 100 years to gain molecular knowledge about its etiology.

Reliable distinction between these diagnoses is essential as treatment differs substantially, with the wrong treatment potentially leading to serious complications. Past diagnostic measures using the classical water deprivation test had several pitfalls and clinicians were often left with uncertainity concerning the diagnosis. With the establishment of copeptin, a stable and reliable surrogate marker for arginine vasopressin, diagnosis of the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome has been newly evaluated. Whereas unstimulated basal copeptin measurement reliably diagnoses nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, two new tests using stimulated copeptin cutoff levels showed a high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating central diabetes insipidus from primary polydipsia. For the hypertonic saline infusion test, osmotic stimulation via the induction of hypernatraemia is used. This makes the test highly reliable and superior to the classical water deprivation test, but also requires close supervision and the availability of rapid sodium measurements to guarantee the safety of the test. Alternatively, arginine infusion can be used to stimulate copeptin release, opening the doors for an even shorter and safer diagnostic test. The test protocols of the two tests are provided and a new copeptin-based diagnostic algorithm is proposed to reliably differentiate between the different entities.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of copeptin level measurements in the differential diagnosis between DI and primary polydipsia (PP). METHODS: A literature search of electronic databases from January 1, 2005, to July 13, 2022, was performed. Primary studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of copeptin concentration in patients with DI and PP were considered eligible. Two reviewers independently screened relevant articles and extracted data. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. The hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model and bivariate method were used. RESULTS: Seven studies including 422 patients with polydipsia-polyuria syndrome were included; of the 422 patients, 189 (44.79%) presented with arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, cranial DI) and 212 (50.24%) with PP. The summary estimates of the diagnostic performance of stimulated copeptin to differentiate between PP and AVP-D were 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89-0.97) for sensitivity and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.88-1.00) for specificity. Baseline copeptin level showed high performance in identifying AVP resistance (nephrogenic DI), with a pooled sensitivity of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.82-1.00) and specificity of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.98-1.00); however, it showed little value in the differentiation between PP and AVP-D. CONCLUSION: Copeptin level measurement is a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of patients with DI and PP.

Though a disease presenting with polyuria and thirst had been recognized since Antiquity, it was not until the 17. Century the distinction was made between diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus. At the beginning of the 20. Century almost nothing was known about the function of the pituitary. It was generally believed that diabetes insipidus was a renal disease. Two clinical observations in 1912 suggested an association between the hypophysis and diabetes insipidus. This view was supported by the recognition in 1913 that extract of the posterior lobe of the pituitary was effective in diabetes insipidus. Despite much evidence to the contrary, it was assumed that the antidiuretic hormone was produced in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary. Around 1950 it was finally established that 'the posterior lobe hormones' are in fact secreted in the hypothalamus. At the same time the antidiuretic hormone was isolated and synthesized. More recently, progress within genetics has made it possible to characterize in details other rare types of diabetes insipidus.",,"['Lindholm, Jorgen']",['Lindholm J'],,"['Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Holstebro Hospital, 7500 Holstebro, Denmark. j.lindholm@ofir.dk']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pituitary,Pituitary,9814578,,IM,"['Diabetes Insipidus/diagnosis/etiology/*history', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'History, 17th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Pituitary Gland, Posterior/pathology', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/complications']",,,,2005/01/11 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2005/01/11 09:00'],"['2005/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/b:pitu.0000044633.52516.e1 [doi]'],ppublish,Pituitary. 2004;7(1):33-8. doi: 10.1023/b:pitu.0000044633.52516.e1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 43-year-old man with a previous diagnosis of IgG4-RD due to recurrent right lacrimal gland enlargement with eyelid erythema presented with diabetes insipidus. DIAGNOSES: We performed a pituitary Magnetic Resonance Imaging which revealed posterior pituitary rim changes with inhomogeneous enhancement and nodular-like thickening of the pituitary stalk, and performed a water-deprivation-vasopressin test confirmed central diabetes insipidus, and in combination with the patient's elevated IgG4 levels and past medical conditions, we diagnosed central diabetes insipidus, IgG4-related hypophysitis, and IgG4-RD. INTERVENTIONS: After the patient was admitted to the hospital we gave methylprednisolone 500 mg intravenously once daily for 4 days and again for 4 consecutive days after a 10-day interval. During this period combined with mycophenolate mofetil 250 mg twice daily and desmopressin acetate 0.1 mg 3 times daily. OUTCOMES: The patient was followed up for a sustained period of 6 months and no side effects of glucocorticoid therapy were noted, there were no signs of recurrence, and the daily urine output stabilized in the normal range. LESSONS: We recognized that IgG4 levels do not reflect relapse or long-term control, and that glucocorticoid shock therapy is an optional and reliable treatment strategy for relapsed patients.","['Copyright (c) 2023 the Author(s).

METHODS: Analysis of prospectively collected data of 449 consecutive patients operated on for anterior skull base pathology. DI was defined as a polyuria (> 250 ml/h for >/= 2 consecutive hours) polydipsia syndrome associated with hypotonic urine with or without hypernatraemia. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of postoperative DI. A simple scoring system was then created. RESULTS: Postoperative DI occurred in 46 (10.2%) patients. The development of DI did not affect quality of life. Predictors of DI on multivariate analysis included suprasellar extension (OR 2.2; p = 0.04), age < 50 years (OR 2.8; p = 0.003), craniopharyngioma histology (OR 6.7; p = 0.002), and Kelly grade 3 intraoperative CSF leak (OR 2.1; p = 0.04). The SALT score was created based on these characteristics, with one point awarded for each feature present, and predicted DI with fair to good predictive value in our cohort (AUROC 0.735 (95%CI 0.65-0.82)). The rates of postoperative DI were 4.0%, 6.5%, 15.0%. 36.8% and 85.7% for SALT scores of zero, one, two, three, and four, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The SALT score predicts postoperative DI with fair to good accuracy, and now requires prospective external validation. Improved prediction of DI could optimize resource allocation and facilitate individualised preoperative patient counselling. We also provide our algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of DI.","['(c) 2021.

Since diabetes insipidus is masked by concurrent panhypopituitarism, it can impede the diagnosis of pituitary dysfunction. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old Japanese female suffering from pituitary and thalamic metastases caused by untreated breast cancer, underwent a biopsy targeting the thalamus, not the pituitary. She lacked prebiopsy pituitary dysfunction symptoms; however, these symptoms unexpectedly occurred after biopsy. Diabetes insipidus was masked by corticosteroid insufficiency, and she showed normal urinary output and plasma sodium levels. Upon commencement of glucocorticoid replacement therapy, the symptoms of diabetes insipidus appeared. CONCLUSIONS: In this case, thalamic biopsy, as opposed to pituitary biopsy, was performed to preserve pituitary function. However, pituitary dysfunction could not be avoided. Caution is necessary for asymptomatic patients with pituitary metastases as invasive interventions, such as surgery, may induce pituitary dysfunction. Moreover, with respect to masked diabetes insipidus, there is a need to carefully consider pituitary dysfunction to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed treatment.",['(c) 2021.

She was well with desmopressin nasal spray until further 2 months later, when she developed bilateral optic neuritis, together with gait disturbance, intention tremor of the upper extremities, urinary retention, constipation, abnormal sensation in the distal part of the lower extremities, and moderate hemiplegia on the left side. Autoantibodies, including anti-aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), were all negative. She showed multifocal spinal cord lesions on MRI and oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid obtained by spinal tap, and so underwent steroid pulse therapy with methylprednisolone in the tentative diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, resulting in visual acuity recovery and alleviation of neurological symptoms. In the literature review, the combination of optic neuritis and hypophysitis, mostly with diabetes insipidus, was reported in 15 patients as case reports before the years of COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 vaccination would trigger the onset of hypophysitis and optic neuritis in this patient.",,"['Matsuo, Toshihiko', 'Okubo, Kohei', 'Mifune, Hirofumi', 'Imao, Takeshi']","['Matsuo T', 'Okubo K', 'Mifune H', 'Imao T']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6570-0030'],"['Okayama University, Japan.', 'Ochiai Hospital, Maniwa, Japan.', 'Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan.', 'Kaneda Hospital, Maniwa, Japan.', 'Kaneda Hospital, Maniwa, Japan.', 'Kaneda Hospital, Maniwa, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,Journal of investigative medicine high impact case reports,101624758,"['0 (COVID-19 Vaccines)', '0 (mRNA Vaccine)']",IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects', 'Pandemics', '*COVID-19/complications', '*Diabetes Insipidus/etiology', '*Hypophysitis', '*Optic Neuritis', '*Diabetes Mellitus']",PMC10338657,['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19 mRNA vaccine', 'diabetes insipidus', 'lymphocytic hypophysitis', 'multiple sclerosis', 'optic neuritis']",2023/07/11 13:11,2023/07/12 06:42,['2023/07/11 07:42'],"['2023/07/12 06:42 [medline]', '2023/07/11 13:11 [pubmed]', '2023/07/11 07:42 [entrez]']","['10.1177_23247096231186046 [pii]', '10.1177/23247096231186046 [doi]']",ppublish,J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep. 2023 Jan-Dec;11:23247096231186046. doi: 10.1177/23247096231186046.,,"['The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the', 'research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiating between CDI etiologies is difficult. What has initially been classified as ""idiopathic"" central diabetes insipidus might in fact underlie various pathogenic mechanisms that are less understood to date and/or are not obvious at initial presentation. Therefore, even if idiopathic CDI is diagnosed at the time of onset, it is common for tumors such as germinoma to develop during surveillance. Crucially, a delayed diagnosis of germinoma may be associated with a worse prognosis. Recently, the presence of anti-rabphilin-3A antibodies has been found to be a highly sensitive and specific marker of lymphocytic infundibuloneurohypophysitis, an autoimmune-mediated CDI. CASE PRESENTATION: We herein present two cases, namely, a 13-year-old boy (patient 1) and a 19-year-old young man (patient 2) who were diagnosed with idiopathic CDI. In both patients, panhypopituitarism developed. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed pituitary stalk thickening and pituitary swelling approximately 1 1/2 years after the onset of CDI. Western blotting did not reveal the presence of anti-rabphilin-3A antibodies in serum in either patient, suggesting that autoimmune mechanisms might not be involved. Both patients were subsequently diagnosed with germinoma on pathological examination. They received chemotherapy, followed by radiation therapy. Notably, testosterone and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels normalized, and libido and beard growth recovered after chemoradiotherapy in patient 2. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the absence of anti-rabphilin-3A antibodies in young patients clinically diagnosed with idiopathic CDI may increase the probability of the development of non-lymphocytic lesions, including germinoma. We thus recommend a more attentive approach at the onset of these diseases.",['(c) 2023.

We aimed to investigate this. METHODS: Data for each hospitalisation in patients with CDI attending Oxford University Hospital (OUH) were collected retrospectively. The same cohort were invited to complete a questionnaire by telephone. RESULTS: One hundred and nine patients were included, median age was 42 (range: 6-80) years. Route of desmopressin was tablet, melt and nasal spray in 74%, 7% and 17% of patients, respectively, while two patients used a combination of tablet and nasal spray. There were 85 admissions to OUH by 38 patients between 2012 and 2021. Daily measurement of serum sodium was performed in 39% of admissions; hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia occurred in 44 and 15% of admissions, respectively. Endocrine consultation was sought in 63% of admissions post-2018. Forty-five of 78 patients (58%) self-reported >/=1 admission to any hospital since diagnosis. Of these, 53% felt their medical team did not have a good understanding of the management of CDI during hospital admission. Twenty-four per cent reported delay in administration of desmopressin, while 44% reported confusion between CDI and diabetes mellitus, often leading to unnecessary blood glucose monitoring. CONCLUSION: Dysnatraemia is common in hospitalised patients with CDI. More than half of patients perceived their medical team's understanding of CDI to be poor when admitted with intercurrent illness. A coordinated approach, including early consultation of specialists, frequent serum sodium monitoring, and education of hospital specialists is needed to address this.",,"['Dilrukshi, M D S A', 'Vickars, Marcus', 'May, Christine J H', 'Makaya, Taffy', 'Ryan, Fiona', 'Jafar-Mohammadi, Bahram', 'Wass, John A H', 'Pal, Aparna', 'Garrahy, Aoife']","['Dilrukshi MDSA', 'Vickars M', 'May CJH', 'Makaya T', 'Ryan F', 'Jafar-Mohammadi B', 'Wass JAH', 'Pal A', 'Garrahy A']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6387-0175'],"['Department of Endocrinology, Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism.', 'Department of Paediatric Endocrinology, Oxford University Hospitals Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Endocrinology, Oxford University Hospitals Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Endocrinol,European journal of endocrinology,9423848,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Nasal Sprays)', '0 (Tablets)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'ENR1LLB0FP (Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring', 'Child', 'Deamino Arginine Vasopressin/therapeutic use', '*Diabetes Insipidus/therapy', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic/epidemiology/therapy', '*Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasal Sprays', 'Perception', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sodium', 'Tablets', 'Young Adult']",,,,2022/07/29 06:00,2022/08/04 06:00,['2022/07/28 10:52'],"['2022/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2022/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/08/04 06:00 [medline]', '2022/07/28 10:52 [entrez]']",['10.1530/EJE-22-0187 [doi]'],epublish,Eur J Endocrinol. 2022 Aug 2;187(3):489-495. doi: 10.1530/EJE-22-0187.

Other neurological adverse events, however, have not methodically been described and studied. Furthermore, safety data on CAR-T cell therapy in patients with central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma remain limited. MAIN BODY: We here report occurrence of a Guillain-Barre-like syndrome (GBS) and central diabetes insipidus (cDI) following tisagenlecleucel therapy for relapsed high-grade lymphoma with CNS involvement. Both complications were refractory to standard treatment of ICANS. Weakness of respiratory muscles required mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy while cDI was treated with desmopressin substitution for several weeks. Muscle-nerve biopsy and nerve conduction studies confirmed an axonal pattern of nerve damage. T cell-rich infiltrates and detection of the CAR transgene in muscle-nerve sections imply a direct or indirect role of CAR-T cell-mediated inflammation. In line with current treatment guidelines for GBS, intravenous immunoglobulin was administered and gradual but incomplete recovery was observed over the course of several months. CONCLUSIONS: This case report highlights the risk of rare but severe neurological adverse events, such as acute GBS or cDI, in patients treated with CAR-T cells. It further underlines the importance of appropriate patient surveillance and systematic reporting of rare complications to eventually improve treatment.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Central diabetes insipidus produces a strong thirst sensation, which may be difficult to distinguish when complicated by salivary insufficiency. A 45-year-old man was admitted to our department for a thorough examination of his thirst and polyuria. He had suddenly developed these symptoms more than one year earlier and visited an oral surgeon. Swelling of the left submandibular gland, right parotid gland, and cervical lymph nodes had been observed. Since his IgG4 level was relatively high at 792 mg/dL and a lip biopsy showed high plasmacytoid infiltration around the gland ducts, he had been diagnosed with IgG4-related disease. He had started taking 0.4 mg/kg/day of prednisolone, and his chief complaint temporarily improved. However, since the symptom recurred, he was referred to our institution. After admission, to examine the cause of his thirst and polyuria, we performed a water restriction test, vasopressin loading test, hypertonic saline loading test and pituitary magnetic resonance imaging. Based on the findings, we diagnosed him with central diabetes insipidus due to IgG4-related hypophysitis. We increased the dose of prednisolone to 0.6 mg/kg/day and started 10 mug/day of intranasal desmopressin. His symptoms were subsequently alleviated, and his serum IgG4 level finally normalized. We should remember that IgG4-related disease can be accompanied by hypophysitis and that central diabetes insipidus is brought about by IgG4-related hypophysitis. This case report should remind physicians of the fact that pituitary inflammation due to IgG4-related disease is very rare and can be masked by symptoms due to salivary gland inflammation, which can lead to pitfalls in the diagnosis in clinical practice.",,"['Iwamoto, Yuichiro', 'Mori, Shigehito', 'Tatsumi, Fuminori', 'Sugisaki, Toshitomo', 'Dan, Kazunori', 'Katakura, Yukino', 'Kimura, Tomohiko', 'Shimoda, Masashi', 'Nakanishi, Shuhei', 'Mune, Tomoatsu', 'Kaneto, Hideaki']","['Iwamoto Y', 'Mori S', 'Tatsumi F', 'Sugisaki T', 'Dan K', 'Katakura Y', 'Kimura T', 'Shimoda M', 'Nakanishi S', 'Mune T', 'Kaneto H']",,"['Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kawasaki Medical School, Japan.', 'Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kawasaki Medical School, Japan.', 'Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kawasaki Medical School, Japan.', 'Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kawasaki Medical School, Japan.', 'Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kawasaki Medical School, Japan.', 'Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kawasaki Medical School, Japan.', 'Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kawasaki Medical School, Japan.', 'Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kawasaki Medical School, Japan.', 'Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kawasaki Medical School, Japan.', 'Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kawasaki Medical School, Japan.', 'Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kawasaki Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,"['9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Male', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', '*Autoimmune Hypophysitis/complications/diagnosis', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic/complications/diagnosis', '*Immunoglobulin G4-Related Disease/complications', 'Polyuria', '*Pituitary Diseases/diagnosis', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', '*Sialadenitis/complications/diagnosis', 'Inflammation/complications', 'Immunoglobulin G', '*Diabetes Insipidus/complications/diagnosis', '*Diabetes Mellitus']",PMC9790782,['NOTNLM'],"['IgG-related disease', 'central diabetes insipidus', 'hypophysitis', 'steroid therapy', 'vasopressin']",2022/05/16 06:00,2022/12/03 06:00,['2022/05/15 21:53'],"['2022/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/12/03 06:00 [medline]', '2022/05/15 21:53 [entrez]']",['10.2169/internalmedicine.9365-22 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med. 2022 Dec 1;61(23):3541-3545. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.9365-22.

Adequate restoration of circulation and treatment of shock is key. Pediatric treatment guidelines of DKA have become standard but complexities arise in children with co-morbidities. Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by impaired kidney concentrating ability and treatment is challenging. NDI and DKA together have only been previously reported in one patient. CASE DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: We present the case of a 12-year-old male with NDI and new onset DKA with hyperosmolality. He presented in hypovolemic shock with altered mental status. Rehydration was challenging and isotonic fluid resuscitation resulted in increased urine output and worsening hyperosmolar state. Use of hypotonic fluid and insulin infusion led to lowering of serum osmolality faster than desired and increased the risk for cerebral edema. Despite the rapid decline in serum osmolality his mental status improved so we allowed him to drink free water mixed with potassium phosphorous every hour to match his urinary output (1:1 replacement) and continued 0.45% sodium chloride based on his fluid deficit and replacement rate with improvement in his clinical status. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the challenges in managing hypovolemic shock, hyperosmolality, and extreme electrolyte derangements driven by NDI and DKA, as both disease processes drive excessive urine output, electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, and rapid fluctuation in osmolality.","['(c) 2022.

It should be suspected in any neonate presenting with excessive urine output and hypernatremia that persists despite increased fluid administration. Diabetes insipidus may be secondary to asphyxia, intraventricular hemorrhage, infection, and structural abnormalities or may be idiopathic or genetic. Diagnosis includes a careful history, laboratory testing, and magnetic resonance imaging. Management of neonatal DI involves a careful balance between fluid intake and pharmacologic treatment. In this article we report a case of an extremely low birth weight infant presenting with central DI possibly caused by abnormality of the pituitary gland. Persistent hypernatremia was the initial presentation. Increased fluids were given initially but were only partially helpful. Eventually subcutaneous desmopressin (DDAVP) was required.

It is an autosomal recessive disorder, mostly involving the Wolfram syndrome 1 gene (WFS1). The phenotypic pleiomorphism, rarity, and molecular complexity complicate the follow-up of these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and the follow-up of 11 patients with this disorder. We retrospectively analysed all WFS patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2020 in the Centro Hospitalar Sao Joao, a tertiary hospital in Northern Portugal. RESULTS: Eleven patients were included. Four patients had all 4 components of DIDMOAD. The presentation was diabetes mellitus (DM) in 9 patients, optic atrophy (OA) in another patient, and diabetes insipidus (DI) in another one. The median age of DM and OA diagnosis was 6 and 14 years, respectively. Nine patients had diabetes mellitus, and the other 2 patients had impaired glucose tolerance. All patients had OA. Four patients presented DI, all of them diagnosed in adolescence. Four patients had hearing impairment, 5 had urological abnormalities, 5 had neurological disorders, and 8 had psychiatry disorders.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of patients with pituitary adenoma who underwent transsphenoidal surgery. The pituitary gland was assessed using a 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging, and the predictors of postoperative diabetes insipidus were determined through univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 212 eligible patients with pituitary adenomas were included; 82 (38.7%) cases developed postoperative diabetes insipidus while 130 cases (61.3%) did not. Diabetes insipidus was transient in 80 (37.7%) patients and permanent in 2 (0.9%) patients. The results of logistic regression analyses showed that the change in cephalocaudal tumor cavity diameter after transsphenoidal surgery was associated with the occurrence of postoperative diabetes insipidus. CONCLUSIONS: Change in cephalocaudal tumor cavity diameter after transsphenoidal surgery may play an important role in predicting diabetes insipidus onset in patients with a pituitary adenoma.",['(c) 2022.

Albeit rare, there have also been documented cases of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) associated with lithium use. CASE REPORT A 31-year-old woman with a past medical history of bipolar disorder, managed with lithium 300 mg by mouth every day for 3 years, was assessed for a 1-year history of polyuria with accompanying polydipsia. During her initial hospital stay, her estimated urine output was more than 4 L per day. Initial labs showed elevated serum sodium (149 mmol/L; reference range 135-145), elevated serum osmolality (304 mOsm/kg; reference range 275-295), urine osmolality of 99 mOsm/kg (reference range 50-1200), and urine specific gravity (1.005; reference range 1.005-1.030). Lithium was at a subtherapeutic level of 0.05 mEq/L (reference range 0.6-1.2). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed no abnormalities of the pituitary gland. Two different occasions of desmopressin administration resulted in >50% increase in urine osmolality, confirming the diagnosis of CDI. Common causes of CDI, including trauma, tumors, and familial CDI, were ruled out and chronic lithium use was determined as the most probable cause for the patient's CDI. CONCLUSIONS CDI in the background of chronic lithium use is rarely reported. We present this case to consider CDI as a differential diagnosis when evaluating polyuria and hypernatremia in patients with long-term lithium use. These presentations warrant the consideration of both types of diabetes insipidus in the differential diagnoses.",,"['Li, Jeffrey J', 'Tan, Shirley', 'Kawashita, Takumi', 'Tagle, Christian A', 'Farmand, Farbod']","['Li JJ', 'Tan S', 'Kawashita T', 'Tagle CA', 'Farmand F']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5869-6846'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, California University of Science and Medicine, Colton, CA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, California University of Science and Medicine, Colton, CA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, Colton, CA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, Colton, CA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, Colton, CA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,['9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)'],IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Adult', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic/chemically induced/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Lithium', 'Polyuria/chemically induced/complications', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Nephrogenic/chemically induced/diagnosis', '*Hypernatremia/chemically induced', '*Diabetes Mellitus']",PMC9883600,,,2023/01/24 06:00,2023/01/25 06:00,['2023/01/23 01:22'],"['2023/01/23 01:22 [entrez]', '2023/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['939034 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.939034 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2023 Jan 23;24:e939034. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.939034.,20230123,['Conflict of interest: None declared'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathomechanisms are probably multifaceted, but severe hyponatremia may also occur as a result of underlying SIADH or hypocortisolism. Patients with preexisting AVP dysfunction, like SIADH or diabetes insipidus, are at high risk for severe electrolyte imbalances in the event of a COVID-19 infection.The recently growing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in oncology is associated with a spectrum of endocrine immune-related adverse events (endocrine irAEs). These AEs usually occur unpredictably and may even manifest after discontinuation of the anticancer therapy. Hyponatremia is a common factor of several endocrine irAEs and may serve as a red flag biomarker for possibly underlying endocrine irAEs such as hypophysitis or adrenalitis. New-onset hyponatremia should always prompt a comprehensive diagnostic workup and exclusion of endocrine irAEs before the diagnosis of SIADH is made.Hyponatremia with severe symptoms should be treated with hypertonic (3 %) saline solution to resolve the cerebral edema and prevent from detrimental neurological sequelae. Both rapid intermittent bolus (RIB) therapy and continuous infusion therapy have now been reported to be safe and equally effective. The RIB therapy limits the risk of overcorrection and requires less often re-lowering treatment than continuous infusion therapy.Fluid restriction has long been considered as first-line treatment of chronic hyponatremia due to SIADH. Additional treatment with Furosemid and/or oral NaCl tablets does not improve efficacy but reduces tolerance to therapy.Copeptin-based dynamic tests show higher diagnostic accuracy in the differential diagnosis of patients with hypotonic polyuria polydipsia syndrome than the indirect water deprivation test.",['Thieme.

Both forms are associated with AQP2 downregulation and collecting duct (CD) cellular remodeling. Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs appearing to increase AQP2 membrane-translocation and improve urine concentration in other NDI models. We have investigated if statins are able to prevent or rescue the Li-induced changes in mice and in a mouse cortical CD cell line (mCCD(c1l) ). Biotinylation assays showed that acute (1hr) atorvastatin, simvastatin, or fluvastatin increased AQP2 membrane accumulation in mCCD(c1l) cells showing that the cell line responds to acute statin treatment. To see whether chronic statin treatment abolish the Li effects, mCCD(c1l) cells were treated with 48 h Li, combined Li/atorvastatin or combined Li/simvastatin. Li reduced AQP2, but combined Li/atorvastatin or Li/simvastatin did not prevent AQP2 downregulation. In mice, chronic (21 days) Li increased urine output and reduced urine osmolality, but combined Li/atorvastatin did not prevent these effects. In inner medulla (IM), Li reduced total AQP2 and increased pS261-AQP2. Combined Li/atorvastatin did not abolish these changes. Atorvastatin did not prevent a Li-induced increase in intercalated cells and proliferation in IM. In mice with already established NDI, atorvastatin had no effect on the Li-induced changes either. Mice subjected to 14 days of potassium-deficient diet developed polyuria and AQP2 downregulation in IM. Co-treatment with atorvastatin did not prevent this. In conclusion, atorvastatin does not appear to be able to prevent or rescue Li-NDI or to prevent hypokalemic-induced NDI.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Secondary adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary metastatic tumors should be considered as an alternative diagnosis when clinicians encounter patients with lung cancer who demonstrate hyponatremia. However, masked central diabetes insipidus should also be considered to prevent critical dehydration when glucocorticoid replacement therapy will be initiated. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old man with advanced lung adenocarcinoma demonstrated high-grade hyponatremia of 122 mmol/L. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a metastatic pituitary tumor and endocrinological examinations confirmed panhypopituitarism, including secondary adrenal insufficiency. Hydrocortisone replacement revealed masked diabetes insipidus with elevation of serum sodium levels that reached 151 mmol/L. Desmopressin administration was required to prevent water depletion and to immediately ameliorate the hypernatremia. CONCLUSIONS This is the first case report of masked diabetes insipidus that demonstrated high-grade hyponatremia. Secondary adrenal insufficiency can mask the hypernatremia that is a typical manifestation of diabetes insipidus.

Identifying diagnostic difficulties in patients with CDI will help ensure an optimal approach to their management and follow-up. This study aimed to characterize the clinical and etiological characteristics of CDI in pediatric patients. METHODS: We analyzed the admission and follow-up data of CDI patients aged 0-18 years who were followed in our center between 2010 and 2019. RESULTS: The study included 56 patients with a mean age at diagnosis of 7.92 +/- 5.11 years and symptom duration of 8.65 +/- 21.3 months. The patients were grouped by etiology into those with organic causes, such as structural anomalies, tumors, and trauma (group 1, n=41) and other causes (group 2, n=15). The prevalence of idiopathic CDI was 16%. At least one pituitary hormone deficiency was detected in 60.7%, the most common being thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency. Patients in group 1 had a higher mean age at diagnosis, shorter symptom duration, and higher frequency of other pituitary hormone deficiencies compared to group 2. Additionally, germinoma was detected 1 year subsequent to normal MRI findings at diagnosis and another patient was diagnosed with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) 5 years after diagnosis. All patients responded well to replacement therapies, but two patients with germinoma died during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In the pediatric age group, intracranial organic pathologies are an important etiology of CDI, and despite a short symptomatic period, determining the cause may be challenging and prolonged. Patients presenting at a young age with a long history of symptoms and no other pituitary hormone deficiency are unlikely to have organic CDI. However, organic causes such as LCH should be evaluated at all ages. Patients with idiopathic disease are candidates for further etiological studies, and repeated cranial imaging is important during follow-up.","['(c) 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.']","['Gasimova, Elnare', 'Berberoglu, Merih', 'Ozsu, Elif', 'Aycan, Zehra', 'Uyanik, Rukiye', 'Bilici, Esra', 'Ceran, Aysegul', 'Siklar, Zeynep']","['Gasimova E', 'Berberoglu M', 'Ozsu E', 'Aycan Z', 'Uyanik R', 'Bilici E', 'Ceran A', 'Siklar Z']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3459-5781'],"['Department of Pediatrics Balkiraz Mahallesi, Ankara Univesity School of Medicine, Mamak, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Ankara Univesity School of Medicine, Mamak, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Ankara Univesity School of Medicine, Mamak, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Ankara Univesity School of Medicine, Mamak, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Ankara Univesity School of Medicine, Mamak, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Ankara Univesity School of Medicine, Mamak, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Ankara Univesity School of Medicine, Mamak, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Ankara Univesity School of Medicine, Mamak, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,9508900,['0 (Pituitary Hormones)'],IM,"['*Brain Neoplasms/complications', 'Child', '*Diabetes Insipidus/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology', '*Diabetes Mellitus', '*Germinoma/complications', '*Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Humans', '*Hypopituitarism/complications', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Pituitary Hormones']",,['NOTNLM'],"['antidiuretic hormone', 'central diabetes insipidus', 'childhood', 'etiology']",2022/07/14 06:00,2022/08/13 06:00,['2022/07/13 08:02'],"['2022/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2022/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/08/13 06:00 [medline]', '2022/07/13 08:02 [entrez]']","['jpem-2022-0058 [pii]', '10.1515/jpem-2022-0058 [doi]']",epublish,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2022 Jul 12;35(8):1089-1096. doi: 10.1515/jpem-2022-0058.

To answer this, multicenter retrospective analysis was performed. METHODS: A questionnaire on clinical findings, histological diagnosis, and details of surgical procedures was sent to 86 neurosurgical and 35 pediatrics departments in Japan. RESULTS: Fifty-one institutes reported 132 cases that fulfilled the 3 criteria. Tissue sampling was performed in 91 cases from pineal (n = 44), neurohypophyseal (n = 32), both (n = 6), and distant (n = 9) lesions. Histological diagnosis was established in 89 cases: pure germinoma or germinoma with syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells in 82 (92.1%) cases, germinoma and mature teratoma in 2 cases, and granulomatous inflammation in 2 cases. Histological diagnosis was not established in 2 cases. Although no tumors other than GCTs were identified, 3 (3.4%) patients had non-germinomatous GCTs (NGGCTs). None of the patients developed permanent complications after endoscopic or stereotactic biopsy. Thirty-nine patients underwent simultaneous procedure for acute hydrocephalus without permanent complications, and hydrocephalus was controlled in 94.9% of them. CONCLUSION: All patients who fulfilled the 3 criteria had GCTs or granulomatous inflammation, but not other types of tumors. However, no fewer than 3.4% of the patients had NGGCTs. Considering the safety and the effects of simultaneous procedures for acute hydrocephalus, biopsy was recommended in such patients.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

DESIGN: Blinded randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Patients aged 18-65 operated for sellar-suprasellar tumours in an Indian tertiary care centre were enrolled through total enumeration sampling and underwent randomization with allocation concealment during Sep 2018-Feb 2019. Pre-operative DI, postoperative ventilation, renal failure or decompensated diabetes mellitus were excluded. Patients in the intervention group received a nurse-led DI bundle (validated by three Delphi rounds) with four dietary components: intake of only water during thirst and avoidance of the following-added salt, high-protein foods and caffeinated drinks. Treating clinicians and the investigator assessing outcome were blinded about enrolment. Urine output, serum sodium, vasopressin requirement and hospital stay were assessed as primary outcomes. The outcome measures were monitored daily till the 6th postoperative day. Analyses were performed on 'intention-to-treat' basis, irrespective of compliance. Independent t-test and Chi-square test were used. RESULTS: Of the initial 63 patients, 50 fulfilling criteria were randomized to two groups and assessed over six days yielding 150 patient-days per group. There were no significant baseline differences between groups. The mean daily urine output was significantly lower in the DI bundle group than in control, both overall and among endonasal operated pituitary adenomas [3000.09(462.7) vs. 4095.71(896.4)ml & 2987.14(419.5) vs. 4064.73(1051)ml], with the greatest difference on the second postoperative day. Though hypernatraemia in controls became most prominent during days 2-3 and resolved in a week, it was significantly lower in the intervention group (12.7% vs. 30.7% overall, 11.4% vs. 29.4% endonasal adenomas). The need for vasopressin analogues and hospital stay were also significantly lower with DI bundle (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This is probably the first ever report of dietary DI bundle among operated pituitary patients, which seem to flatten the DI trend with significant benefits in polyuria, hypernatraemia, vasopressin requirement and hospital stay. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CTRI/2018/07/015127 of ICMR. IMPACT: The nurse-led dietary DI bundle has effectively reduced the severity of DI among operated pituitary patients with significant benefits in polyuria, hypernatraemia, vasopressin requirement and hospital stay. Its implementation is simple and easy to carry out, especially in resource-constrained institutions, where continuous monitoring and repeated serum sodium estimation are difficult.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Koundal, Hemlata', 'Dhandapani, Manju', 'Thakur, Pratibha', 'Dutta, Pinaki', 'Walia, Rama', 'Sahoo, Sushant K', 'Chhabra, Rajesh', 'Dhandapani, Sivashanmugam']","['Koundal H', 'Dhandapani M', 'Thakur P', 'Dutta P', 'Walia R', 'Sahoo SK', 'Chhabra R', 'Dhandapani S']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3351-3841', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3497-4255']","['National Institute of Nursing Education (NINE), PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.', 'National Institute of Nursing Education (NINE), PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.', 'National Institute of Nursing Education (NINE), PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Endocrinology, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Endocrinology, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,J Adv Nurs,Journal of advanced nursing,7609811,,IM,"['*Adenoma/surgery', '*Diabetes Insipidus/drug therapy', '*Diabetes Mellitus', 'Humans', '*Pituitary Neoplasms/surgery', 'Postoperative Period']",,['NOTNLM'],"['RCT', 'SIADH', 'antidiuretic hormone', 'diabetes insipidus', 'hypernatraemia', 'nurse-led care', 'nursing', 'pituitary', 'polyuria', 'urine output']",2021/05/25 06:00,2021/08/18 06:00,['2021/05/24 12:42'],"['2021/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/24 12:42 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jan.14894 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adv Nurs. 2021 Sep;77(9):3911-3920. doi: 10.1111/jan.14894.

Genetic testing in familial cases of FNDI should be carry out to ensure adequate treatments and avoid disease manifestations especially in infants. METHODS: In this study, we investigated three-generations of a large Italian family with clinical diagnosis of familial central diabetes insipidus for the presence of potential pathogenic mutations in the AVP gene. RESULTS: We identified a heterozygous missense mutation (c.154 T > A; p.C52S) in AVP gene in all affected members studied of a large Italian family. In silico tools were used to investigate the pathogenic role of the mutation and three-dimensional protein structure predicted that the p.C52S impairs disulfide bridges formation resulting in misfolding of the protein.

A mutation in the vasopressin gene determining hypothalamic diabetes insipidus was detected in Brattleboro rats. WAG rats are carriers of normal vasopressin gene. Another interlinear difference was linked to tyrosinase gene controlling melanin synthesis. WAG rats express mutant allele determining albino phenotype. Brattleboro rats had normal working tyrosinase gene. F2 segregation yielded phenotypic classes with two patterns of tumor growth: linear growth or regression.

METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed clinical data from 26 patients with DI, including micturition diary, water deprivation tests, imaging data and management. The UUTD and AUTD systems were used to evaluate the urinary tract characteristics. All patients were required to undergo VUDS, neurophysiologic tests to confirm the presence of neurogenic bladder (NB). RESULTS: VUDS showed that the mean values for bladder capacity and bladder compliance were 575.0 +/- 135.1 ml and 51.5 +/- 33.6 cmH(2)O in DI patients, and 42.3% (11/26) had a post-void residual >100 ml. NB was present in 6 (23.1%) of 26 DI patients with UUTD, and enterocystoplasty was recommended for two patients with poor bladder capacity, compliance and renal impairment. For the 24 remaining patients, medication combined with individualized and appropriate bladder management, including intermittent catheterization, indwelling catheter and regular voiding, achieved satisfactory results. High serum creatinine decreased from 248.0 +/- 115.8 mumoI/L to 177.4 +/- 92.8 mumoI/L in 12 patients from a population with a median of 108.1 mumoI/L (IQR: 79.9-206.5 mumoI/L). Forty-four dilated ureters showed significant improvement in the UUTD grade, and the median grade of 52 UUTD ureters decreased from 3 to 2. CONCLUSION: Bladder distension, trabeculation and decreased or absent sensations were common features for DI patients with UUTD. Individualized therapy by medication combined with appropriate bladder management can improve UUTD and renal function in DI patients.","['Copyright (c) 2022 Wang, Ying, Zhang, Li, Chen, Zhou and Liao.']","['Wang, Xuesheng', 'Ying, Xiaoqian', 'Zhang, Fan', 'Li, Xing', 'Chen, Guoqing', 'Zhou, Zhonghan', 'Liao, Limin']","['Wang X', 'Ying X', 'Zhang F', 'Li X', 'Chen G', 'Zhou Z', 'Liao L']",,"['Department of Urology, China Rehabilitation Research Center, School of Rehabilitation of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Urology, China Rehabilitation Research Center, School of Rehabilitation of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Urology, China Rehabilitation Research Center, School of Rehabilitation of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Urology, China Rehabilitation Research Center, School of Rehabilitation of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Urology, China Rehabilitation Research Center, School of Rehabilitation of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Qingdao, China.', 'Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Urology, China Rehabilitation Research Center, School of Rehabilitation of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Qingdao, China.', 'Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),Frontiers in endocrinology,101555782,,IM,"['*Diabetes Insipidus', '*Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dilatation', 'Humans', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Urinary Bladder, Neurogenic', '*Urinary Tract']",PMC9354454,['NOTNLM'],"['bladder distension', 'diabetes insipidus', 'individualized therapy', 'neurogenic bladder', 'upper urinary tract dilatation']",2022/08/09 06:00,2022/08/10 06:00,['2022/08/08 04:08'],"['2022/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2022/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/08/08 04:08 [entrez]', '2022/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fendo.2022.941453 [doi]'],epublish,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2022 Jul 22;13:941453. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2022.941453. eCollection 2022.,20220722,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent contrast-enhanced CT scan identified gigantic uterine fibroids and retroperitoneal tumor. She was referred to the gynecologist at JA Toride Medical Center and planned to undergo a uterus enucleation and biopsy of the retroperitoneal tumor. The surgery was conducted without any troubles. After the surgery, the patient presented polyuria with urine volume 10-20 L a day and developed hypovolemic shock. Laboratory test revealed hypotonic urine and hypernatremia. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) loading test suggested shortage of endogenous vasopressin. Since the subcutaneous administration of AVP was not sufficient to control the urine volume, continuous intravenous infusion of AVP was initiated. After achieving hemodynamic stability, the treatment was switched to oral desmopressin. MRI finding indicated attenuation of high signal in posterior pituitary in T1 weighted image while neither enlargement of pituitary nor thickening of pituitary stalk was indicated by enhanced MRI. Hypertonic salt solution test indicated no responsive elevation of AVP, confirming the diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus (CDI). Her anterior pituitary function was preserved. Only anti-rabphilin-3A antibody was found positive in the serum of the patient, while other secondary causes for CDI were denied serologically and radiologically. Hence, lymphocytic infundibuloneurohypophysitis　(LINH) was suspected as the final diagnosis. Hormonal replacement therapy by nasal desmopressin was continued and the patient managed to control her urine volume. In cases of CDI considered idiopathic with conventional examinations, anti-rabphilin-3A antibody may be a clue for determining the cause as LINH.",['(c) 2022.

However, the detailed mechanism remains unclear. Here we used the analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics and metabolic intervention in a lithium-induced NDI model. Mice were treated with lithium chloride (40 mmol/kg chow) and rotenone (ROT, 100 ppm) in diet for 28 days. Transmission electron microscopy showed extensive mitochondrial structural abnormalities in whole nephron. ROT treatment markedly ameliorated lithium-induced NDI and mitochondrial structural abnormalities. Moreover, ROT attenuated the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential in line with the upregulation of mitochondrial genes in kidney. Metabolomics and transcriptomics data demonstrated that lithium activated galactose metabolism, glycolysis, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. All these events were indicative of metabolic reprogramming in kidney cells. Importantly, ROT ameliorated metabolic reprogramming in NDI model. Based on transcriptomics analysis, we also found the activation of MAPK, mTOR and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways and impaired focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction and actin cytoskeleton in Li-NDI model were inhibited or attenuated by ROT treatment. Meanwhile, ROT administration inhibited the increase of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in NDI kidneys along with enhanced SOD2 expression. Finally, we observed that ROT partially restored the reduced AQP2 and enhanced urinary sodium excretion along with the blockade of increased PGE2 output. Taken together, the current study demonstrates that mitochondrial abnormalities and metabolic reprogramming play a key role in lithium-induced NDI, as well as the dysregulated signaling pathways, thereby serving as a novel therapeutic target.",['Copyright (c) 2023.

Thus, we aim to study the occurrences, outcomes, and risk factors of CDI of survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed post-OHCA patients treated at a single center. Central diabetes insipidus was retrospectively defined by diagnostic criteria. One-month cerebral performance category (CPC) scores were collected for outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 169 patients evaluated, 36 patients (21.3%) were diagnosed with CDI. All CDI patients had a poor neurologic outcome of either CPC 4 (13.9%) or CPC 5 (86.1%), and CDI was strongly associated with mortality. Age (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-0.99), respiratory arrest (OR, 6.62; 95% CI, 1.23-35.44), asphyxia (OR, 9.26; 95% CI, 2.17-34.61), and gray to white matter ratio on brain computed tomogram (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81-0.95) were associated with the development of CDI. The onset of CDI was earlier (P < .001) and the maximum 24-hour urine output was larger (P = .03) in patients with worst outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: All patients diagnosed with CDI had poor neurologic outcomes, and occurrence of CDI was associated with mortality.

No signs of ataxia, diabetes insipidus and neurologic anomalies were found. The diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome is not always easy in the first stages of the disease. The suspect may come from the presence of a juvenile diabetes mellitus asssociated with optic atrophy.

Postoperative copeptin levels may guide clinicians in stratifying patients who need close monitoring of fluid balance. The objective is to determine whether copeptin is a predictive marker of postoperative diabetes insipidus (DI). METHODS: This is a prospective diagnostic study. Patients who underwent neurosurgical intervention of the sellar-suprasellar regions were recruited. Serum copeptin levels were measured before and after surgery, within 24 hours. Logistic regression analysis and diagnostic performance measures were calculated to determine the relationship between postoperative copeptin levels and DI. RESULTS: Of 82 patients, 26 (31.7%) developed postoperative DI, with 7 patients (8.5%) having permanent DI. The samples for copeptin measurement were taken at 13 +/- 2.1 hours postoperatively. From the receiver operating characteristic analysis, low postoperative copeptin levels (<2.5 pmol/L) demonstrated an acceptable ability to predict DI (area under the curve, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60-0.84). Discriminative power was stronger in the permanent DI group (area under the curve, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.64-1.00). Postoperative copeptin levels <2.5 pmol/L were associated with DI (specificity > 91%). However, postoperative copeptin levels >20 pmol/L were rarely associated with DI, with a negative predictive value of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing sellar-suprasellar interventions, low postoperative copeptin levels within the first postoperative day predict postoperative DI, whereas high levels exclude it. Copeptin measurement should be applied in the clinical practice of postoperative care in patients following hypothalamic-pituitary surgery. This study may expand the potential use of copeptin, including in the Asian population.",['Copyright (c) 2020 AACE. Published by Elsevier Inc.

That which we call a rose/By any other name would smell as sweet."" (Juliet, from Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare). Shakespeare's implication is that a name is nothing but a word and it therefore represents a convention with no intrinsic meaning. Whilst this may be relevant to romantic literature, disease names do have real meanings, and consequences, in medicine. Hence, there must be a very good rational for changing the name of a disease that has a centuries-old historical context. A working group of representatives from national and international endocrinology and pediatric endocrine societies now proposes changing the name of ""diabetes insipidus"" to ""Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency (AVP-D)"" for central etiologies, and ""Arginine Vasopressin Resistance (AVP-R)"" for nephrogenic etiologies.

METHODS: Medical records of patients who underwent trans-sphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma resection between 2010 and 2021 at 3 different neurosurgical centers by 4 experienced neurosurgeons were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into 2 groups (DI group or control group). Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors associated with postoperative DI. Univariate logistic regression was performed to identify variables of interest. Covariates with a P value <0.05 were incorporated into multivariate logistic regression models to identify independently associated risk factors for DI. All statistical tests were conducted using RStudio. RESULTS: A total of 344 patients were included; 68% were women, the mean age was 46.5 years, and nonfunctioning adenomas were the most frequent (171, 49.7%). The mean tumor size was 20.3 mm. Covariates associated with postoperative DI were age, female gender, and gross total resection. The multivariable model showed that age (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, CI 0.95-0.99, P = 0.017) and female gender (OR 2.92, CI 1.50-6.03, P = 0.002) remained significant predictors of DI development. Gross total resection was no longer a significant predictor of DI in the multivariable model (OR 1.86, CI 0.99-3.71, P = 0.063), suggesting that this variable may be confounded by other factors.

Copeptin is a stable surrogate marker of AVP release and has potential to facilitate prompt diagnosis of post-operative DI. This assay has been shown to accurately predict which patients are likely to develop DI following pituitary surgery. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether copeptin analysis can be used to predict which patients are at risk of developing DI following trans-sphenoidal surgery (TSS). METHODS: Seventy-eight patients undergoing TSS had samples taken for copeptin pre-operatively and at day 1 post-TSS. The majority of patients also had samples from day 2, day 8, and week 6 post-TSS. Results from patients who developed post-operative DI (based on clinical assessment, urine and plasma biochemistry and the need for treatment with DDAVP) were compared to those who did not. Patients with any evidence of pre-operative DI were excluded. RESULTS: Of 78 patients assessed, 11 were clinically determined to have developed DI. Differences were observed between patients with DI and those without in post-operative samples. Of note, there was a significant difference in plasma copeptin at day 1 post-operation (p = 0.010 on Kruskal-Wallis test), with copeptin levels greater than 3.4 pmol/l helping to rule out DI (91% sensitivity, 55% specificity at this cut off). CONCLUSION: In the post-TSS setting, copeptin is a useful rule-out test in patients with values above a defined threshold, which may facilitate earlier decision making and shorter hospital stays.",['(c) 2022.

DI rats have a deficiency in the synthesis of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and a reduced content of pituitary oxytocin (OT). They are characterized also by polyuria, polydipsia, and they seldom ingest high concentrations of NaCl solutions. We also tested if the appetite can be influenced by neurohypophyseal hormones especially oxytocin (OT) because it inhibits SSA in other animals. DI rats and Long Evans (LE) controls were fed ad libitum and given a choice between water, and either 0.9% or 1.8% NaCl. The data showed a significant increase of daily spontaneous water intake in DI compared with LE rats. Both DI and LE ingested similar small spontaneous volumes of the isotonic NaCl solution, but DI rats drank significantly less hypertonic NaCl than the LE controls. I.c.v infusion of AngII induced significant sodium intake in LE rats, but only raised water intake in DI rats. When combined with i.c.v. Ang II, OVT enhanced salt intake in LE animals while AVP attenuated water intake in both groups of rats and blocked NaCl intake completely in LE rats. In conclusion, DI rats did not demonstrate a SSA in response to central administration of AngII, although the drinking of water was enhanced. In combination with i.c.v. AngII, AVP inhibits water drinking in both DI and LE rats. In the LE controls OT attenuates AngII-induced SSA but has no effect in DI rats.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

Prolonged polyuria resulting from central diabetes insipidus and cerebral salt wasting complicated by gradient washout and a type of secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, however, has not been described previously, to the best of our knowledge. We report an unusual case of an infant with glioblastoma who, after tumor resection, was treated for concurrent central diabetes insipidus and cerebral salt wasting complicated by secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. CASE PRESENTATION: A 5-month-old Hispanic girl was found to have a large, hemorrhagic, suprasellar glioblastoma causing obstructive hydrocephalus. Prior to mass resection, she developed central diabetes insipidus. Postoperatively, she continued to have central diabetes insipidus and concurrent cerebral salt wasting soon after. She was managed with a vasopressin infusion, sodium supplementation, fludrocortisone, and urine output replacements. Despite resolution of her other major medical issues, she remained in the pediatric intensive care unit for continual and aggressive management of water and sodium derangements. Starting on postoperative day 18, her polyuria began increasing dramatically and did not abate with increasing vasopressin. Nephrology was consulted. Her blood urea nitrogen was undetectable during this time, and it was thought that she may have developed a depletion of inner medullary urea and osmotic gradient: a ""gradient washout."" Supplemental dietary protein was added to her enteral nutrition, and her fluid intake was decreased. Within 4 days, her blood urea nitrogen increased, and her vasopressin and fluid replacement requirements significantly decreased. She was transitioned soon thereafter to subcutaneous desmopressin and transferred out of the pediatric intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: Gradient washout has not been widely reported in humans, although it has been observed in the mammalian kidneys after prolonged polyuria. Although not a problem with aquaporin protein expression or production, gradient washout causes a different type of secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus because the absence of a medullary gradient impairs water reabsorption. We report a case of an infant who developed complex water and sodium imbalances after brain injury. Prolonged polyuria resulting from both water and solute diuresis with low enteral protein intake was thought to cause a urea gradient washout and secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The restriction of fluid replacements and supplementation of enteral protein appeared adequate to restore the renal osmotic gradient and efficacy of vasopressin.",,"['Chang, Nathan', 'Mariano, Karley', 'Ganesan, Lakshmi', 'Cooper, Holly', 'Kuo, Kevin']","['Chang N', 'Mariano K', 'Ganesan L', 'Cooper H', 'Kuo K']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9982-3175'],"[""Department of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, Palo Alto, CA, USA. nchang@stanfordchildrens.org."", ""Department of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, Palo Alto, CA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, Palo Alto, CA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, Palo Alto, CA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, Palo Alto, CA, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,['9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Brain Injuries', 'Child', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Nephrogenic/complications', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic', '*Diabetes Mellitus', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney', 'Sodium']",PMC7547417,['NOTNLM'],"['Brain injury', 'Central diabetes insipidus', 'Cerebral salt wasting', 'Gradient washout', 'Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus']",2020/10/11 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/10/10 05:23'],"['2019/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/10 05:23 [entrez]', '2020/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-020-02536-0 [pii]', '2536 [pii]', '10.1186/s13256-020-02536-0 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2020 Oct 10;14(1):183. doi: 10.1186/s13256-020-02536-0.,20201010,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of nasogastric use of ODL in disabled children with CDI. Time to serum sodium normalisation was compared with that of children with normal intellect and CDI treated with sublingual DDAVP. METHODS: Clinical, laboratory and neuroimaging characteristics were evaluated for 12 disabled children with CDI treated with ODL through nasogastric tube at Dr Behcet Uz Children's Hospital, Turkey, between 2012 and 2022. RESULTS: Six boys and six girls with a mean (+/-SD) age of 43 (+/- 40) months were evaluated. These children (mean [+/-SD] weight standard deviation score [SDS] - 1.2 +/- 1.7; mean [+/-SD] height SDS - 1.3 +/- 1.4) presented with failure to thrive, irritability, prolonged fever, polyuria and hypernatraemia (mean serum sodium 162 [+/-3.6] mEq/L). At diagnosis, mean serum and urine osmolality were 321 (+/- 14) mOsm/kg and 105 (+/- 7.8) mOsm/kg, respectively. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels were undetectable (< 0.5 pmol/L) at diagnosis in all patients. Nasogastric tube administration of DDAVP lyophilisate (120 microg/tablet) dissolved in water (10 mL) was commenced at a dose of 1-5 microg/kg/day in two divided doses together with controlled water intake to avoid hyponatraemia. The frequency and dose of DDAVP were titrated based on urine output and serum sodium concentration. Serum sodium declined at a rate of 0.11 +/- 0.03 mEq/L/h and reached normal range in a mean duration of 174 +/- 46.5 h. Serum sodium declined faster in children with normal intellect and CDI treated with sublingual DDAVP (1.28 +/- 0.39 mEq/L/h; p = 0.0003). Three disabled children needed rehospitalisation because of hypernatraemia due to unintentional DDAVP omission by caregivers. No episode of hyponatraemia was observed. Weight gain and growth were normal during the median (+/- interquartile range) follow-up duration of 32 +/- 67 months. CONCLUSIONS: Nasogastric administration of oral DDAVP lyophilised formulation was safe and effective in the treatment of CDI in disabled children in this small retrospective series.","['(c) 2023.

Metformin is considered the preferred initial therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the protective effect of metformin on the kidney damage caused by lithium administration. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using an animal model of chronic lithium-induced NDI, rats were divided into 4 groups: sham, metformin, lithium, and lithium + metformin. The effects of these treatments were examined using serum electrolytes, blood and tissue total antioxidant status, total oxidant status, the oxidative stress index, urine and blood osmolality, and tissue aquaporin-2 (AQP2) levels. Additionally, histopathological changes, including congestion, hydropic swelling, tubular necrosis, tubular atrophy, and Bowman's capsule dilatation, were evaluated. The total histopathological score was obtained by summing the scores for each pathological finding. RESULTS: In the lithium group, biochemical variables indicating NDI, including sodium, chloride and blood osmolality, increased, and urine osmolality decreased, compared to the sham group. With metformin treatment, the blood osmolality decreased from 328.17 mOsm/kg to 306.33 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality increased from 349.67 mOsm/kg to 754.50 mOsm/kg (p = 0.004 and p = 0.001, respectively). Tissue AQP2 levels decreased with lithium administration but stabilized with metformin treatment. Additionally, in comparison to the lithium group, the total histopathological score in the metformin group declined from 8.0 to 2.0 (p = 0.002).

Its use has been associated with several uncommon adverse renal effects, though rarely all in conjunction or without the combined use of protease inhibitors. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old woman living with HIV whose viral load is suppressed on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and dolutegravir presented with 1 day of generalized weakness and myalgia causing an inability to ambulate. This was associated with nausea and vomiting and profound fatigue. She was found to have an acute kidney injury, non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia. Urinalysis revealed pyuria with white blood cell casts, glucosuria, and proteinuria. The diagnosis was made of tenofovir-induced nephrotoxicity. The tenofovir was discontinued, and the patient was initiated on intravenous fluids and electrolyte and bicarbonate supplementation with improvement in her symptoms and laboratory values. CONCLUSIONS: This report suggests the possibility of severe tenofovir-induced nephrotoxicity with combined acute kidney injury, Fanconi syndrome, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in the absence of other provoking factors such as use with protease inhibitors or advanced HIV disease, chronic kidney disease, and age.

That which we call a rose/By any other name would smell as sweet.' (Juliet, from Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare). Shakespeare's implication is that a name is nothing but a word and it therefore represents a convention with no intrinsic meaning. Whilst this may be relevant to romantic literature, disease names do have real meanings, and consequences, in medicine. Hence, there must be a very good rationale for changing the name of a disease that has a centuries-old historical context. A working group of representatives from national and international endocrinology, nephrology and pediatric societies now proposes changing the name of 'diabetes insipidus' to 'arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D)' for central etiologies and 'arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R)' for nephrogenic etiologies.

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is associated with up to 3-fold risk of incident chronic kidney disease among lithium users. There are limited randomized controlled trials (RCT) for treatments of lithium-induced NDI, and existing therapies can be poorly tolerated. Therefore, novel treatments are needed for lithium-induced NDI. METHOD: We conducted a 12-week double-blind pilot RCT to assess the feasibility and efficacy of 20 mg/d atorvastatin vs placebo in the treatment of NDI in chronic lithium users. Patients, recruited between September 2017 and October 2018, were aged 18 to 85, currently on a stable dose of lithium, and determined to have NDI. RESULTS: Urinary osmolality (UOsm) at 12 weeks adjusted for baseline was not statistically different between groups (+39.6 mOsm/kg [95% CI, -35.3, 114.5] in atorvastatin compared to placebo groups). Secondary outcomes of fluid intake and aquaporin-2 excretions at 12 weeks adjusted for baseline were -0.13 L [95% CI, -0.54, 0.28] and 98.68 [95% CI, -190.34, 387.70], respectively. A moderate effect size was observed for improvements in baseline UOsm by >/=100 mOsm/kg at 12 weeks in patients who received atorvastatin compared to placebo (38.45% (10/26) vs 22.58% (7/31); Cohen's d = 0.66). CONCLUSION: Among lithium users with NDI, atorvastatin 20 mg/d did not significantly improve urinary osmolality compared to placebo over a 12-week period. Larger confirmatory trials with longer follow-up periods may help to further assess the effects of statins on NDI, especially within patients with more severe NDI.",['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We describe a case of an elderly woman on chronic lithium therapy for bipolar affective disorder who initially presented with dehydration from vomiting but possibly developed extra-pontine myelinolysis (EPM) after over-zealous correction of hyponatraemia. Steroids administered appeared to have prevented further progression but a persisting hyperosmolar state then alerted us to the presence of nephrogenic DI.

Some studies have reported varying frequencies of DI and have showed its association with increased mortality, suggesting it as a marker of poor outcome. This knowledge gap in the acute care consequences of DI in severe TBI patients led us to conceive this study, aimed at identifying risk factors and quantifying the effect of DI on short-term functional outcomes and mortality. METHODS: We assembled a historic cohort of adult patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale </= 8) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary-care university hospital over a 6-year period. Basic demographic characteristics, clinical information, imaging findings, and laboratory results were collected. We used logistic regression models to assess potential risk factors for the development of DI, and the association of this condition with death and unfavorable functional outcomes [modified Rankin scale (mRS)] at hospital discharge. RESULTS: A total of 317 patients were included in the study. The frequency of DI was 14.82%, and it presented at a median of 2 days (IQR 1-3) after ICU admission. Severity according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of the head, intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and skull base fracture was suggested as risk factors for DI. Diagnosis of DI was independently associated death (OR 4.34, CI 95% 1.92-10.11, p = 0.0005) and unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale = 4-6) at discharge (OR 7.38; CI 95% 2.15-37.21, p = 0.0047). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes insipidus is a frequent and early complication in patients with severe TBI in the ICU and is strongly associated with increased mortality and poor short-term outcomes. We provide clinically useful risk factors that will help detect DI early to improve prognosis and therapy of patients with severe TBI.",,"['Gempeler, Andres', 'Orrego-Gonzalez, Eduardo', 'Hernandez-Casanas, Andres', 'Castro, Andres M', 'Aristizabal-Mayor, Juan D', 'Mejia-Mantilla, Jorge H']","['Gempeler A', 'Orrego-Gonzalez E', 'Hernandez-Casanas A', 'Castro AM', 'Aristizabal-Mayor JD', 'Mejia-Mantilla JH']",,"['Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Fundacion Valle del Lili, Carrera 98 #18-49, Cali, Colombia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universidad ICESI, Cali, Colombia.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Clinicas, Fundacion Valle del Lili, Carrera 98 # 18-49, Cali, Colombia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universidad ICESI, Cali, Colombia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universidad ICESI, Cali, Colombia.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Clinicas, Fundacion Valle del Lili, Carrera 98 # 18-49, Cali, Colombia.', 'Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Fundacion Valle del Lili, Carrera 98 #18-49, Cali, Colombia.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Clinicas, Fundacion Valle del Lili, Carrera 98 # 18-49, Cali, Colombia.', 'Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Fundacion Valle del Lili, Carrera 98 #18-49, Cali, Colombia. jorge.mejia@fvl.org.co.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universidad ICESI, Cali, Colombia. jorge.mejia@fvl.org.co.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Neurocrit Care,Neurocritical care,101156086,,IM,"['Adult', '*Brain Injuries, Traumatic/complications/epidemiology/therapy', '*Diabetes Insipidus/epidemiology/etiology', '*Diabetes Mellitus', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Brain Injuries, Traumatic', 'Closed', 'Craniocerebral trauma', 'Critical care', 'Diabetes Insipidus', 'Diabetes insipidus', 'Head injuries', 'Hypernatremia', 'Neurogenic']",2020/03/25 06:00,2021/09/24 06:00,['2020/03/25 06:00'],"['2020/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12028-020-00955-x [pii]', '10.1007/s12028-020-00955-x [doi]']",ppublish,Neurocrit Care. 2020 Dec;33(3):718-724. doi: 10.1007/s12028-020-00955-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-existing CDI and diabetes mellitus without inherited disorders such as Wolfram syndrome are rare. It is both important and challenging to diagnose this combination because the 2 conditions present with thirst, polydipsia, and polyuria. A few cases of CDI developing in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) have been reported. We report an unusual case of CDI that developed in an older patient with T2D. The aims of this report are to share the clinical course and discuss clues to the early diagnosis of CDI in T2D. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old Japanese woman developed T2D with hyperglycemia symptoms, including thirst, polydipsia, and polyuria. After starting medical treatment, the hyperglycemia and its symptoms improved. The glycated hemoglobin level decreased from 9% to 6%. However, 5 years later (at 75 years of age), she re-exhibited thirst, polydipsia, and polyuria despite stable glycemic control. Her urine volume was large (6.3 L/day). A urine glucose test was negative. The plasma osmolality was high (321 mOsm/kg), while the urinary osmolality was low (125 mOsm/kg). A significant increase in urinary osmolality following vasopressin administration indicated a diagnosis of CDI. Desmopressin therapy effectively relieved the symptoms. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the need to consider CDI as a rare but important comorbid disorder in patients with diabetes mellitus, including T2D, particularly those presenting with thirst, polydipsia, and polyuria despite well-controlled glycemia.",,"['Ohara, Nobumasa', 'Takada, Toshinori', 'Seki, Yasuhiro', 'Akiyama, Katsuhiko', 'Yoneoka, Yuichiro']","['Ohara N', 'Takada T', 'Seki Y', 'Akiyama K', 'Yoneoka Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1467-5864'],"['Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Uonuma Kikan Hospital, Minamiuonuma, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Uonuma Kikan Hospital, Minamiuonuma, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Uonuma Kikan Hospital, Minamiuonuma, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Uonuma Kikan Hospital, Minamiuonuma, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Uonuma Kikan Hospital, Minamiuonuma, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Aged', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic/diagnosis/etiology', 'Polyuria/diagnosis/etiology/drug therapy', '*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications', 'Polydipsia/diagnosis/etiology', '*Hyperglycemia/complications']",PMC9811334,,,2023/01/01 06:00,2023/01/04 06:00,['2022/12/31 01:22'],"['2022/12/31 01:22 [entrez]', '2023/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['938482 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.938482 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2022 Dec 31;23:e938482. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.938482.,20221231,['Conflict of interest: None declared'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, there is a need to develop prediction models of postoperative DI specifically for patients who undergo endoscopic TSS. This study establishes and validates prediction models of DI after endoscopic TSS for patients with PA using machine learning algorithms. METHODS: We retrospectively collected information about patients with PA who underwent endoscopic TSS in otorhinolaryngology and neurosurgery departments between January 2018 and December 2020. The patients were randomly split into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%). The 4 machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and decision tree) were used to establish the prediction models. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated to compare the performance of the models. RESULTS: A total of 232 patients were included, and 78 patients (33.6%) developed transient DI after surgery. Data were randomly divided into a training set (n = 162) and a test set (n = 70) for development and validation of the model, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was highest in the random forest model (0.815) and lowest in the logistic regression model (0.601). Invasion of pituitary stalk was the most important feature for model performance, closely followed by macroadenomas, size classification of PA, tumor texture, and Hardy-Wilson suprasellar grade. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning algorithms identify preoperative features of importance and reliably predict DI after endoscopic TSS for patients with PA. Such a prediction model may enable clinicians to develop individualized treatment strategy and follow-up management.",['Copyright (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Lymphocytic infundibulo-hypophysitis (LIH) due to autoimmune involvement of the pituitary stalk is a differentiating disease, and anti-rabphilin-3A antibody (Rab3A-Ab) positivity was recently reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 7-year-old boy was diagnosed with CDI after having polyuria for two months. He showed growth hormone deficiency with reduced growth rate. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a thickened pituitary stalk. The placental alkaline phosphatase level of the cerebrospinal fluid, tumor marker for germ cell tumors, was below the level of sensitivity. No skin or bone findings suggestive of Langerhans cell histiocytosis were detected. Eight months after CDI onset, Rab3A-Ab was positive, and MRI showed shrinking of the thickened pituitary stalk, leading to the diagnosis with LIH. CONCLUSIONS: Rab3A-Ab is a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool for childhood-onset LIH.","['(c) 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.']","['Morota, Kazutaka', 'Tadokoro, Hiroaki', 'Sawano, Kentaro', 'Watanabe, Kenichi', 'Iwata, Naoko', 'Fujisawa, Haruki', 'Suzuki, Atsushi', 'Sugimura, Yoshihisa', 'Nagasaki, Keisuke']","['Morota K', 'Tadokoro H', 'Sawano K', 'Watanabe K', 'Iwata N', 'Fujisawa H', 'Suzuki A', 'Sugimura Y', 'Nagasaki K']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5882-661X'],"['Department of Paediatrics, Nagaoka Red Cross Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Nagaoka Red Cross Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Division of Paediatrics, Department of Homeostatic Regulation and Development, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Nagaoka Red Cross Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Daido Hospital, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Nagaoka Red Cross Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Division of Paediatrics, Department of Homeostatic Regulation and Development, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],Germany,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,9508900,['Combined Pituitary Hormone Deficiency'],IM,"['*Autoimmune Hypophysitis/diagnosis', 'Child', '*Diabetes Insipidus/pathology', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic/diagnosis/etiology', '*Diabetes Mellitus/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypopituitarism', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Pituitary Gland/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Placenta/pathology', 'Pregnancy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['anti-rabphilin-3A antibody', 'central diabetes insipidus', 'lymphocytic hypophysitis']",2022/02/05 06:00,2022/05/11 06:00,['2022/02/04 08:43'],"['2021/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2022/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2022/02/04 08:43 [entrez]']","['jpem-2021-0674 [pii]', '10.1515/jpem-2021-0674 [doi]']",epublish,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2022 Feb 4;35(5):687-690. doi: 10.1515/jpem-2021-0674.

WFS seems to be a heterogeneous disease that has not yet been fully characterized in terms of clinical features and pathophysiological mechanisms because the number of patients in most series was small. In this study we describe 31 Lebanese WFS patients belonging to 17 families; this, to our knowledge, is the largest number of patients reported in one series so far. Criteria for diagnosis of WFS were the presence of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy unexplained by any other disease. Central diabetes insipidus was found in 87% of the patients, and sensorineural deafness confirmed by audiograms was present in 64.5%. Other less frequent features included neurological and psychiatric abnormalities, urodynamic abnormalities, limited joint motility, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal autonomic neuropathy, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in males, and diabetic microvascular disease. New features, not reported in previous descriptions, such as heart malformations and anterior pituitary dysfunction, were recognized in some of the patients and participated in the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Genetic analysis revealed WFS1 gene mutations in three families (23.5%), whereas no abnormalities were detected in mitochondrial DNA.

Recognition and report of potential adverse effects of these novel vaccines (especially the urgent and life-threatening ones) is therefore essential. CASE PRESENTATION: A 16-year-old boy presented to the Paediatric Emergency Department with polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss over the last four months. His past medical history was unremarkable. Onset of symptoms was referred to be few days after first dose of anti-COVID-19 BNT162b2 Comirnaty vaccine and then worsened after the second dose. The physical exam was normal, without neurological abnormalities. Auxological parameters were within normal limits. Daily fluid balance monitoring confirmed polyuria and polydipsia. Biochemistry laboratory analysis and urine culture were normal. Serum osmolality was 297 mOsm/Kg H(2)O (285-305), whereas urine osmolality was 80 mOsm/Kg H(2)O (100-1100), suggesting diabetes insipidus. Anterior pituitary function was preserved. Since parents refused to give consent to water deprivation test, treatment with Desmopressin was administered and confirmed ex juvantibus diagnosis of AVP deficiency (or central diabetes insipidus). Brain MRI revealed pituitary stalk thickening (4 mm) with contrast enhancement, and loss of posterior pituitary bright spot on T1 weighted imaging. Those signs were consistent with neuroinfundibulohypophysitis. Immunoglobulin levels were normal. Low doses of oral Desmopressin were sufficient to control patient's symptoms, normalizing serum and urinary osmolality values and daily fluid balance at discharge. Brain MRI after 2 months showed stable thicken pituitary stalk and still undetectable posterior pituitary. Due to persistence of polyuria and polydipsia, therapy with Desmopressin was adjusted by increasing dosage and number of daily administrations. Clinical and neuroradiological follow-up is still ongoing. CONCLUSION: Hypophysitis is a rare disorder characterized by lymphocytic, granulomatous, plasmacytic, or xanthomatous infiltration of the pituitary gland and stalk.

However, some cases of CDI could spontaneously resolve during the follow-up period. Hence, this study aimed to determine the predictive factors for the spontaneous resolution of CDI. METHODS: Data of patients with CDI who underwent EES for craniopharyngioma between February 2009 and June 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were divided into 2 groups based on the resolution of CDI during follow-up: the recovery and no recovery groups. The baseline characteristic, surgical, and follow-up results of patients were compared. RESULTS: We identified 84 patients with CDI (35 in the recovery group and 49 in the no recovery group). A direct comparison showed that retaining the pituitary stalk (57.1% vs. 14.3%, P = 0.000) and no-hypothalamic injury (HI) (68.6% vs. 20.4%, P = 0.000) were more common in the recovery group, whereas hydrocephalus at diagnosis (8.6% vs. 46.9%, P = 0.000) was significantly more common in the no recovery group. Subsequently, we found through univariate and multivariate analysis that the spontaneous resolution of CDI was associated with hydrocephalus at diagnosis (yes vs. no: odds ratio [OR], 0.198; P = 0.045), pituitary stalk injury (retaining vs. sectioning: OR, 7.055; P = 0.004), and the Hong et al HI pattern (mild-HI vs. no-HI: OR, 0.183; P = 0.038; unilateral-HI vs. no-HI: OR, 0.147; P = 0.017; bilateral-HI vs. no-HI: OR, 0.154; P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: Hydrocephalus at diagnosis, pituitary stalk injury, and the Hong et al HI pattern might be predictors of the spontaneous resolution of CDI following EES for craniopharyngioma.",['Copyright (c) 2023.

Although the hypertonic saline infusion test led to high diagnostic accuracy, it is a laborious test requiring close monitoring of plasma sodium levels. As such, we leverage machine learning (ML) to facilitate differential diagnosis of cDI. DESIGN: We analyzed data of 59 patients with cDI and 81 patients with PP from a prospective multicenter study evaluating the hypertonic saline test as new test approach to diagnose cDI. Our primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the ML-based algorithm in differentiating cDI from PP patients. METHODS: The data set used included 56 clinical, biochemical, and radiological covariates. We identified a set of five covariates which were crucial for differentiating cDI from PP patients utilizing standard ML methods. We developed ML-based algorithms on the data and validated them with an unseen test data set. RESULTS: Urine osmolality, plasma sodium and glucose, known transsphenoidal surgery, or anterior pituitary deficiencies were selected as input parameters for the basic ML-based algorithm. Testing it on an unseen test data set resulted in a high area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.87. A further improvement of the ML-based algorithm was reached with the addition of MRI characteristics and the results of the hypertonic saline infusion test (AUC: 0.93 and 0.98, respectively). CONCLUSION: The developed ML-based algorithm facilitated differentiation between cDI and PP patients with high accuracy even if only clinical information and laboratory data were available, thereby possibly avoiding cumbersome clinical tests in the future.",,"['Nahum, Uri', 'Refardt, Julie', 'Chifu, Irina', 'Fenske, Wiebke K', 'Fassnacht, Martin', 'Szinnai, Gabor', 'Christ-Crain, Mirjam', 'Pfister, Marc']","['Nahum U', 'Refardt J', 'Chifu I', 'Fenske WK', 'Fassnacht M', 'Szinnai G', 'Christ-Crain M', 'Pfister M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6186-1830', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3040-4685', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6741-2689', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6170-6398', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6336-0965', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2597-1228']","[""Pediatric Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics Research Center, University Children's Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Departments of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University Hospital of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Central Laboratory, University Hospital Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', ""Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology, University Children's Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Departments of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', ""Pediatric Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics Research Center, University Children's Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Eur J Endocrinol,European journal of endocrinology,9423848,"['0 (Glycopeptides)', '0 (Saline Solution, Hypertonic)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Polyuria/diagnosis', '*Polydipsia, Psychogenic/diagnosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Glycopeptides', '*Diabetes Insipidus/diagnosis', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic/diagnosis', 'Saline Solution, Hypertonic', 'Algorithms', 'Sodium', 'Machine Learning', 'Glucose', 'Polydipsia/diagnosis', '*Diabetes Mellitus']",,,,2022/10/07 06:00,2022/10/29 06:00,['2022/10/06 11:23'],"['2022/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2022/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2022/10/06 11:23 [entrez]']",['10.1530/EJE-22-0368 [doi]'],epublish,Eur J Endocrinol. 2022 Oct 26;187(6):777-786. doi: 10.1530/EJE-22-0368.

We report on a four-generation family, seven individuals had central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and the female index patient seen from age 16 to 26 years had (mild) nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In her father with CDI, a known pathogenic heterozygous AVP variant c.232_234del p.(Glu78del) was identified, confirming the diagnosis of CDI in him and the other affected family members. In the proband, molecular analysis disclosed a novel heterozygous AVPR2 gene variant, c.962A > T p.(Asn321Ile) and an extremely skewed X-inactivation, confirming X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (XL-NDI). Whole exome sequencing showed no further causative mutation. This is the first report on the co-existence of CDI and NDI in one family. Our review of symptomatic female AVPR2 heterozygotes includes 23 families with at least one affected female (including this study). There were 21 different causative mutations. Mutation types in females did not differ from those in males. Both severe XL-NDI and mild forms were reported in females. All six females with severe XL-NDI had complete loss-of-function (null) mutations. The remaining 17 female probands had milder XL-NDI caused by 14 missense variants and three null variants of the AVPR2 gene. X-inactivation was studied in nine of these females; all showed extreme or slight skewing. The review underlines that XL-NDI in female AVPR2 heterozygotes is always accompanied by skewed X-inactivation, emphasizing a need for X-inactivation studies in these females.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to perform functional analyses of three different mutations (p.G45C, 207_209delGGC, and p.G88V) defined in the AVP-NPII gene of patients diagnosed with FNDI, which are not included in the literature. METHODS: For functional analysis studies, the relevant mutations were created using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and restriction fragment replacement strategy and expressed in Neuro2A cells. AVP secretion into the cell culture medium was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) analysis. Fluorescence imaging studies were conducted to determine the differences in the intracellular trafficking of wild-type (WT) and mutant AVP-NPII precursors. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to determine the changing of the conformational properties of domains for both WT and 207-209delGGC mutant structures and dynamics behavior of residues. RESULTS: Reduced levels of AVP in the supernatant culture medium of p.G45C and p.G88V transfected cells compared to 207_209delGGC and WT cells were found. Fluorescence imaging studies showed that a substantial portion of the mutant p.G45C and p.G88V AVP-NPII precursors appeared to be located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas 207_209delGGC and WT AVP-NPII precursors were distributed throughout the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: The mutations p.G45C and p.G88V cause a failure in the intracellular trafficking of mutant AVP-NPII precursors. However, 207_209delGGC mutation does not result in impaired cellular trafficking, probably due to not having any significant effect in processes such as the proper folding, gain of three-dimensional structure, or processing. These results will provide valuable information for understanding the influence of mutations on the function of the AVP precursor hormone and cellular trafficking. Therefore, this study will contribute to elucidate the mechanisms of the molecular pathology of AVP-NPII mutations.","['(c) 2021.

The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 9 mm lesion in the hypothalamic region that significantly increased one month later with the onset of neurological symptoms. A trans-sphenoidal biopsy showed localization of the large B-cell lymphoma. After surgery, the patient presented with polyuria and polydipsia, so desmopressin therapy was started. In the following days, serum osmolarity and sodium fluctuated between normal and low values, then DI was excluded, and SIAD became more likely. Desmopressin therapy was discontinued and hyponatremia was treated with sodium infusion. Hypothalamic lymphoma was treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy with substantial shrinkage. The hyponatremia persisted during anticancer treatments and improved only after radiotherapy, confirming paraneoplastic SIAD. CONCLUSION: Lymphomas of the hypothalamic region can cause electrolyte imbalance for various causes. The differential diagnosis between SIAD, DI and impaired thirst centers may not be straightforward and the electrolyte disorders must be evaluated step by step in all different stages of the disease.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Marilda, Mormando', 'Rosa, Lauretta', 'Stefano, Telera', 'Marta, Bianchini', 'Alfonsina, Chiefari', 'Fiammetta, Natalino', 'Giulia, Puliani', 'Marialuisa, Appetecchia']","['Marilda M', 'Rosa L', 'Stefano T', 'Marta B', 'Alfonsina C', 'Fiammetta N', 'Giulia P', 'Marialuisa A']",,"['Oncological Endocrinology Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Oncological Endocrinology Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Oncological Endocrinology Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Oncological Endocrinology Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Ospedale di Belcolle, Viterbo, Italy.', 'Oncological Endocrinology Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Oncological Endocrinology Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],United Arab Emirates,Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",101269157,"['ENR1LLB0FP (Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', '0 (Electrolytes)']",IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', '*Hyponatremia/complications/diagnosis', 'Deamino Arginine Vasopressin', '*Diabetes Insipidus/complications/diagnosis', 'Sodium', '*Lymphoma/complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Electrolytes', '*Inappropriate ADH Syndrome/complications/diagnosis', '*Diabetes Mellitus']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Lymphoma', 'diabetes', 'electrolytes', 'hypothalamic neoplasms', 'inappropriate ADH syndrome', 'insipidus']",2022/11/26 06:00,2023/05/22 06:42,['2022/11/25 01:03'],"['2022/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2022/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2022/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/05/22 06:42 [medline]', '2022/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/11/25 01:03 [entrez]']","['EMIDDT-EPUB-127817 [pii]', '10.2174/1871530323666221124125253 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets. 2023;23(5):732-737. doi: 10.2174/1871530323666221124125253.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively investigated the incidence, onset, duration and predictors of DI after ETS in patients with non-functioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA). METHODS: A total of 168 patients who underwent ETS to remove NFPAs were included. Various perioperative data on demographics, comorbidities, previous treatments, perioperative hormone deficiencies, tumor characteristics, surgery, anesthesia, intraoperative fluid balance, perioperative laboratory findings, postoperative complications, readmission and hospital length of stay were collected and analyzed. Patients were diagnosed with DI and treated with desmopressin when they showed urine output > 5 mL/kg/hr with a serum sodium concentration > 145 mmol/L or an increase >/= 3 mmol/L in serum sodium concentration between two consecutive tests after surgery. DI was considered permanent when desmopressin was prescribed for > 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: Seventy-seven (45.8%) patients experienced postoperative DI and 10 (6.0%) patients suffered from permanent DI. The median onset of DI and the median duration of transient DI were postoperative day 1 and 5 days, respectively. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, cephalocaudal tumor diameter (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 2.59 [1.05-6.36], P = 0.038) was related to postoperative DI. In receiver operating characteristic analysis, its area under the curve was 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.59-0.76, P < 0.001). Its optimal cutoff value that maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity for postoperative DI was 2.7 cm. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative DI was observed in 45.8% of patients undergoing ETS to remove NFPAs. A large cephalocaudal tumor diameter was predictive of postoperative DI in such patients.",,"['Oh, Hyongmin', 'Cheun, Hyeon', 'Kim, Yoon Jung', 'Yoon, Hyun-Kyu', 'Kang, Ho', 'Lee, Hyung-Chul', 'Park, Hee-Pyoung', 'Kim, Jung Hee', 'Kim, Yong Hwy']","['Oh H', 'Cheun H', 'Kim YJ', 'Yoon HK', 'Kang H', 'Lee HC', 'Park HP', 'Kim JH', 'Kim YH']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9009-4191'],"['Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101, Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101, Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101, Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101, Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101, Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101, Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101, Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, 03080, Korea.', 'Pituitary Center, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101, Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, Korea. kimyh96@snu.ac.kr.', 'Pituitary Center, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, 03080, Korea. kimyh96@snu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['0520200030/Seoul National University Hospital/'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pituitary,Pituitary,9814578,"['9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'ENR1LLB0FP (Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)']",IM,"['*Adenoma/surgery', 'Deamino Arginine Vasopressin', '*Diabetes Insipidus/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology', '*Diabetes Mellitus', 'Humans', '*Pituitary Neoplasms/surgery', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sodium']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cephalocaudal tumor diameter', 'Diabetes insipidus', 'Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery', 'Non-functioning pituitary adenoma']",2020/11/17 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/11/16 05:57'],"['2020/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/16 05:57 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11102-020-01108-1 [pii]', '10.1007/s11102-020-01108-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Pituitary. 2021 Jun;24(3):303-311. doi: 10.1007/s11102-020-01108-1.

METHODS: A Chinese family with CNDI was recruited for participation in this study. The proband and one of his uncles suffered from polydipsia and polyuria since infancy. The results of clinical testing indicated the diagnosis of CNDI. 10 family members had similar symptoms but did not seek medical advice. Genetic testing of mutations in the coding region of the aquaporin 2 (AQP2) gene and the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2) gene were carried out in 11 family members. Somatic DNA from 5 female family members was used to test for methylation of polymorphic CAG repeats in the human androgen receptor (AR) gene, as an index for X-chromosome inactivation pattern (XCIP). RESULTS: AQP2 gene mutations were not found in any family members, but a novel missense mutation (814th base A>G) in exon 2 of the AVPR2 gene was identified in 10 individuals. This mutation leads to a Met 272 Val (GAT-GGT) amino acid substitution. Skewed X-chromosome inactivation patterns of the normal X allele were observed in 4 females with the AVPR2 gene mutation and symptoms of diabetes insipidus, but not in an asymptomatic female with the AVPR2 gene mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Met 272 Val mutation of the AVPR2 gene was identified as a novel genetic risk factor for CDNI. The clinical NDI phenotype of female carriers with heterozygous AVPR2 mutation may be caused by X-chromosome inactivation induced by dominant methylation of the normal allele of AVPR2 gene.",['Copyright (c) 2022 Li Zang et al.'],"['Zang, Li', 'Gong, Yuping', 'Li, Yijun', 'Dou, Jingtao', 'Lyu, Zhaohui', 'Su, Xiaoqing', 'Zhang, Yawei', 'Mu, Yiming']","['Zang L', 'Gong Y', 'Li Y', 'Dou J', 'Lyu Z', 'Su X', 'Zhang Y', 'Mu Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0118-7535', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3344-3540']","['Department of Endocrinology, The First Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', ""Department of Endocrinology, Jiangxi Pingxiang People's Hospital, Pingxiang 337055, China."", 'Department of Endocrinology, The First Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, The First Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, The First Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', ""Department of Endocrinology, Jiangxi Pingxiang People's Hospital, Pingxiang 337055, China."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Jiangxi Pingxiang People's Hospital, Pingxiang 337055, China."", 'Department of Endocrinology, The First Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (AVPR2 protein, human)', '0 (Aquaporin 2)', '0 (Receptors, Vasopressin)']",IM,"['Aquaporin 2/genetics', 'China', 'Chromosomes', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Nephrogenic/diagnosis/genetics', '*Diabetes Mellitus/genetics', 'Female', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Pedigree', '*Receptors, Vasopressin/genetics']",PMC9296320,,,2022/07/23 06:00,2022/07/26 06:00,['2022/07/22 02:31'],"['2022/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2022/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2022/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/22 02:31 [entrez]', '2022/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/07/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2022/7073158 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2022 Jul 12;2022:7073158. doi: 10.1155/2022/7073158. eCollection 2022.,20220712,['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In one patient the course of the disease simulated maturity onset diabetes of the young; another presented with ketoacidosis; but none had haplotypes usually associated with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. The diabetes insipidus responded to chlorpropamide, suggesting partial antidiuretic hormone deficiency. Onset of optic atrophy and loss of vision occurred relatively late and progressed slowly, although in one patient there was a rapid deterioration in visual acuity. Deafness was mild, of late onset, and of sensorineural origin. A degenerative process affecting the central and peripheral nervous system can explain all the manifestations of the syndrome except diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of the diabetes mellitus remains obscure.",,"['Najjar, S S', 'Saikaly, M G', 'Zaytoun, G M', 'Abdelnoor, A']","['Najjar SS', 'Saikaly MG', 'Zaytoun GM', 'Abdelnoor A']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diabetes Insipidus/diagnosis', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/diagnosis', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Hearing Loss, Sensorineural/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Optic Atrophy/diagnosis', 'Wolfram Syndrome/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology']",PMC1777456,,,1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.60.9.823 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1985 Sep;60(9):823-8. doi: 10.1136/adc.60.9.823.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods The clinical data of DI patients admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2018 to 2021 were retrospectively analyzed.The patients were assigned into a child and adolescent group (</= 18 years old) and an adult group (>18 years old) according to their ages.The demographic and biochemical data between two groups of patients with and without HUA were compared.Spearman correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were performed to analyze the correlations between serum uric acid level and other factors. Results Among the 420 DI patients,411 patients had CDI (97.9%),including 189 patients with HUA (46.0%).Thirteen (6.9%) out of the 189 CDI patients with HUA presented the disappearance of thirst.The prevalence of HUA in children and adolescents was higher than that in adults (chi(2)=4.193,P=0.041).The level of serum uric acid in the CDI patients with HUA and disappearance of thirst was higher than those without disappearance of thirst (U=2.593,P=0.010).The multiple linear regression predicted serum creatinine (beta=0.472,95%CI=2.451-4.381,P<0.001) and body mass index (beta=0.387,95%CI=6.18-12.874,P<0.001) as the independent risk factors of serum uric acid level increment in children and adolescents,while serum creatinine (beta=0.361,95%CI=1.016-1.785,P<0.001),body mass index (beta=0.208,95%CI=2.321-6.702,P<0.001),triglyceride (beta=0.268,95%CI=12.936-28.840,P<0.001),and total cholesterol (beta=0.129,95%CI=2.708-22.250,P=0.013) were the independent risk factors in adults. Conclusions The patients with CDI were more likely to have HUA,and the prevalence of HUA in children and adolescents was higher than that in adults.Body mass index,serum creatinine,triglyceride,total cholesterol,and disappearance of thirst were the risk factors for the increased level of serum uric acid in CDI patients.",,"['Wang, Shi-Han', 'Zhu, Hui-Juan', 'Duan, Lian', 'Ping, Fan', 'Wang, Xi', 'Chi, Yue', 'Yuan, Tao']","['Wang SH', 'Zhu HJ', 'Duan L', 'Ping F', 'Wang X', 'Chi Y', 'Yuan T']",,"['Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission,Department of Endocrinology, PUMC Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Beijing 100730,China.', 'Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission,Department of Endocrinology, PUMC Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Beijing 100730,China.', 'Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission,Department of Endocrinology, PUMC Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Beijing 100730,China.', 'Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission,Department of Endocrinology, PUMC Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Beijing 100730,China.', 'Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission,Department of Endocrinology, PUMC Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Beijing 100730,China.', 'Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission,Department of Endocrinology, PUMC Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Beijing 100730,China.', 'Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission,Department of Endocrinology, PUMC Hospital,CAMS and PUMC,Beijing 100730,China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao,Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

We also showed that pharmacologic stimulation of beta3-AR is capable of triggering antidiuresis and correcting polyuria, in the knockout mice for the AVPR2 receptor, the animal model of human X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (XNDI), a rare genetic disease still missing a cure. Here, to demonstrate that the same response can be evoked in humans, we evaluated the effect of treatment with the beta3-AR agonist mirabegron on AQP2 and NKCC2 trafficking, by evaluating their urinary excretion in a cohort of patients with overactive bladder syndrome, for the treatment of which the drug is already approved. Compared to baseline, treatment with mirabegron significantly increased AQP2 and NKCC2 excretion for the 12 weeks of treatment.

Recent evidence indicates that hyperglycemia in diabetic patients, but not in normal subjects, is characterized by elevations of circulating levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP; antidiuretic hormone, ADH). The role and importance of these observations remain to be defined since elevations of plasma AVP levels do not decrease water excretion in diabetic patients. Certain oral sulfonylureas, notably chlorpropamide and tolbutamide, are known to decrease renal free water clearance (CH2O), whereas insulin increases CH2O; the insulin and tolbutamide effects may be clinically trivial, whereas that of chlorpropamide is important. The hyponatremic effect of chlorpropamide may be exaggerated in diabetic patients by concomitant diuretic therapy. Euglycemia during chlorpropamide therapy appears to allow full expression of the action of chlorpropamide on CH2O; hyperglycemia with attendant osmotic diuresis protects chlorpropamide-treated patients against hyponatremia. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents enhances expression of the ADH effect on the kidney, but it does not appear to potentiate chlorpropamide hyponatremia. Two other oral sulfonylurea agents, tolazamide and glyburide, increase CH2O. Diazoxide is an antihypertensive thiazide which is antidiuretic as well as hyperglycemic. Thus, abnormalities of water metabolism are common in diabetes mellitus. Whether certain of these abnormalities are clinically important depends upon the presence of the osmotic diuresis of hyperglycemia and the pharmacology of diabetic management.",,"['Davis, F B', 'Davis, P J']","['Davis FB', 'Davis PJ']",,,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['059QF0KO0R (Water)', '113-79-1 (Arginine Vasopressin)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'WTM2C3IL2X (Chlorpropamide)']",IM,"['Arginine Vasopressin/blood', 'Chlorpropamide/pharmacology', 'Diabetes Insipidus/metabolism', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*metabolism', 'Diabetic Nephropathies/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/blood/metabolism', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Water/*metabolism']",,,,1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(81)90428-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(81)90428-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1981 Jan;70(1):210-4. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(81)90428-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper describes five patients, including four siblings in one family, who have diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness (the DIDMOAD syndrome). The parents of both families are normal but are first cousins. All the patients have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with a typical juvenile-onset. The onset of diabetes insipidus was insidious and the symptoms could easily have been ascribed to poor control of diabetes mellitus. The importance of diagnosing diabetes insipidus is that all these patients had dilatation of the urinary tract varying from mild hydroureter to severe hydronephrosis and this improved with treatment of the diabetes insipidus. It is suggested that patients with diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy should have regular screening tests for diabetes insipidus since it is likely that they represent cases of the full syndrome with incomplete clinical expression. The occurrence of this rare syndrome in four siblings of unaffected parents indicates that the syndrome is due to a recessive gene, but the pathogenesis is unknown.",,"['Page, M M', 'Asmal, A C', 'Edwards, C R']","['Page MM', 'Asmal AC', 'Edwards CR']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Q J Med,The Quarterly journal of medicine,0401027,['11000-17-2 (Vasopressins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Deafness/*genetics', 'Diabetes Insipidus/*genetics', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Recessive', 'Humans', 'Hydronephrosis/complications', 'Male', 'Optic Atrophy/*genetics', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Pedigree', 'Syndrome', 'Urinary Bladder/abnormalities', 'Urine', 'Vasopressins/deficiency', 'Water Deprivation']",,,,1976/07/01 00:00,1976/07/01 00:01,['1976/07/01 00:00'],"['1976/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Q J Med. 1976 Jul;45(179):505-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to AVP, copeptin remains stable for several days at room temperature in serum or plasma. Hence, copeptin serves as a bona fide biomarker of AVP release. We briefly summarise clinical utility of copeptin in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus.

They all awoke from analgesia but, 32 hours after completion of the procedure, they went from alertness to respiratory arrest in less than 1 hour. At this time, serum sodium was 116 +/- 2 mmol/L and blood glucose was 6.7 +/- 0.7 mmol/L. Without treatment for the hyponatremia, urine output spontaneously increased from 38 to 689 mL/h and urine osmolality fell from 546 to 83 mmol/kg body weight. Over the next 51 hours, blood glucose rose to a high of 24.1 +/- 2.5 mmol/L while serum sodium rose to a high of 167 +/- 2 mmol/L. None of the patients regained consciousness. At autopsy, all patients had cerebral edema with herniation along with hypoxic brain damage. The pituitary showed infarction of both anterior and posterior lobes in 7 of 7 patients examined, while 8 of 11 had necrosis of the medulla and 8 of 8 patients examined had hypothalamic necrosis. All had normal pancreas and kidneys at autopsy. Soon after respiratory arrest, all of the patients developed fixed, dilated pupils that often led to the diagnosis of brain death. Autopsy showed compression of the third cranial nerve (oculomotor) because of cerebral herniation. Thus, all of the patients were diagnosed as being brain dead when some may have been saved. These data suggest that in otherwise healthy young women, untreated symptomatic hyponatremia may lead to brain edema, cerebral herniation, and infarction of pituitary and hypothalamus, resulting in central diabetes insipidus and mellitus.",,"['Fraser, C L', 'Arieff, A I']","['Fraser CL', 'Arieff AI']",,"['Veterans Affairs Medical Center, University of California, San Francisco.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,,IM,"['Adult', 'Brain Diseases/*etiology/pathology', 'Cerebral Infarction/etiology', 'Coma/etiology', 'Diabetes Insipidus/*etiology/pathology', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyponatremia/*complications', 'Hypothalamus/blood supply', 'Infarction/etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Pituitary Gland/blood supply', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Seizures/etiology', 'Syndrome']",,,,1990/01/15 00:00,1990/01/15 00:01,['1990/01/15 00:00'],"['1990/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-112-2-113 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1990 Jan 15;112(2):113-9. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-112-2-113.,,,,,,"['Ann Intern Med. 1990 Apr 15;112(8):632-3.

WS is caused mainly by biallelic mutations in the WFS1 gene, which encodes wolframin. Wide tissue distribution of wolframin and many mutations in the wolframin gene resulting in Wolfram syndrome may contribute to different phenotypes and the unusual combinations of clinical features. We describe a female patient with Wolfram syndrome diagnosed at the age of 25, with a previous false diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus and misdiagnosed diabetic complications. The patient was found to be a compound heterozygote for two novel mutations in exon 8 of WFS1 gene: a 2-bp deletion AT at nt 1539 leading to a frameshift (Y513fs) and a single-base substitution 1174C > T resulting in a stop codon (Q392X). A detailed analysis of the patient's medical history and a review of the literature suggest that many cases of Wolfram syndrome may remain undiagnosed due to misdiagnosis as type 1 diabetes mellitus and incorrect interpretation of clinical symptoms of neurodegenerative abnormalities, especially in their early stages.",,"['Homa, Katarzyna', 'Stefanski, Adam', 'Zmyslowska, Agnieszka', 'Moleda, Piotr', 'Bryskiewicz, Marta Ewa', 'Majkowska, Liliana']","['Homa K', 'Stefanski A', 'Zmyslowska A', 'Moleda P', 'Bryskiewicz ME', 'Majkowska L']",,"['Department of Diabetology and Internal Diseases, Pomeranian Medical University Szczecin, Poland. kasho@interia.pl', 'Department of Diabetology and Internal Diseases, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Diabetology and Internal Diseases, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Diabetology and Internal Diseases, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Diabetology and Internal Diseases, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Endokrynol Pol,Endokrynologia Polska,0370674,"['0 (Glycation End Products, Advanced)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (Glycated Serum Albumin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*complications/diagnosis/metabolism', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Female', 'Glycation End Products, Advanced', 'Humans', 'Serum Albumin/metabolism', 'Wolfram Syndrome/*diagnosis/*etiology/metabolism', 'Glycated Serum Albumin']",,,,2014/10/11 06:00,2016/11/01 06:00,['2014/10/11 06:00'],"['2014/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['VM/OJS/J/39798 [pii]', '10.5603/EP.2014.0055 [doi]']",ppublish,Endokrynol Pol. 2014;65(5):398-400. doi: 10.5603/EP.2014.0055.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When compared with controls, all three models showed bladder mass, increased water consumption and urine output, higher mean and maximal increased micturition volumes, and greater bladder capacity and compliance by in vitro cystometry. The changes were more extensive in di/di rats than in the STZ and sucrose-drinking rats. The concentration of bladder collagen decreased in all three rat models when compared with controls. However, the collagen concentration of STZ bladders was significantly lower than the collagen concentration of di/di and sucrose bladders, suggesting that the decrease in bladder collagen concentration associated with experimental diabetes mellitus is only partly related to the increased diuresis. Contractile function was studied using a whole bladder model. Responses of whole bladders from control and diabetic rats to electrical field stimulation, carbachol and KCl were identical. Volume-pressure relations of the isolated whole bladder showed that the magnitude of the contractile response to KCl is constant at intravesical volumes ranging from about 10 to 95% of cytometrical bladder capacity. Bladders from Brattleboro di/di rats and STZ rats showed a rightward shift of volume-passive pressure curves when compared with appropriate controls. Bladders from sucrose-drinking rats had volume-passive pressure curves similar to the bladders from controls. This study suggests that while contractile function remains intact with increased diuresis, the passive function changes, with the bladder becoming more distensible.",,"['Eika, B', 'Levin, R M', 'Longhurst, P A']","['Eika B', 'Levin RM', 'Longhurst PA']",,"['Division of Urology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia.']",['eng'],['41610/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,"['8Y164V895Y (Carbachol)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbachol/pharmacology', 'Collagen/analysis', 'Diabetes Insipidus/*physiopathology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Diuresis/*physiology', 'Electric Stimulation', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Manometry', 'Muscle Contraction/drug effects/physiology', 'Muscle, Smooth/drug effects/physiology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Rats', 'Rats, Brattleboro', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Urinary Bladder/chemistry/*physiopathology', 'Urination/physiology']",,,,1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-5347(17)35001-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-5347(17)35001-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Urol. 1994 Feb;151(2):496-502. doi: 10.1016/s0022-5347(17)35001-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The findings of this 13-year follow-up show that this patient developed typical neurological complications of long-standing diabetes mellitus as in the common type 1 variant. Moreover, some peculiar signs occurred such as anosmia, ophthalmoplegia interna, and central nystagmus. Since Wolfram syndrome is probably part of a more generalized neurodegenerative disorder, long-term prognosis will depend both upon the severity of chronic diabetic complications and upon the rapidity, by which degeneration of cerebellar, pontine and brain stem structures appear. Prognosis of the cardinal clinical signs is such that optic atrophy, though usually quite rapid in the beginning, generally does not lead to complete blindness. Sensorineural hearing loss progresses very slowly so that deafness might be expected exceptionally only. The hearing deficit in classical diabetics, however, is of retrocochlear origin.

METHODS: In total, 13 patients with suspected or clinically diagnosed Wolfram syndrome underwent ophthalmic and systemic examinations and genetic analyses for Wolfram syndrome between August and October 2018. RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects was 24.2 +/- 7.1 years, of which 5 (38.5%) subjects were male and 8 (61.5%) were female. The mean best-corrected visual acuity ranged from counting fingers to 20/40, with a mean of 20/250 (1.10 +/- 0.69 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). Dyschromatopsia was present in all patients (100%). There was a severe decrease in the average peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thicknesses (54.7 +/- 6.5 and 51.9 +/- 4.8 microm, respectively). Optical coherence tomography angiography showed significantly lower whole-image, inside disk, and peripapillary vessel densities in the patients with Wolfram syndrome than in the healthy controls (p < 0.001 for all). All patients who underwent genetic analyses had mutations in the WFS1 gene. Moreover, two novel mutations, p.Met623Trpfs*2 (c.1867delA) and p.Arg611Profs*9 (c.1832_11847del16) at exon 8, were detected. The frequency of systemic findings was as follows: optic atrophy (100%), diabetes mellitus (92.3%), central diabetes insipidus (38.5%), sensorineural hearing loss (38.5%), and presence of urological (30.8%), psychiatric (30.8%), and neurological (23.1%) diseases. CONCLUSION: Wolfram syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that can be associated with severe ophthalmic and systemic abnormalities. All patients who present with unexplained optic atrophy should be evaluated for Wolfram syndrome, even if they do not have diabetes mellitus because optic atrophy can sometimes manifest before diabetes mellitus.",,"['Ustaoglu, Melih', 'Onder, Feyza', 'Karapapak, Murat', 'Taslidere, Hasan', 'Guven, Dilek']","['Ustaoglu M', 'Onder F', 'Karapapak M', 'Taslidere H', 'Guven D']",,"['Glaucoma Research Center, Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Haseki Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Haseki Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Eur J Ophthalmol,European journal of ophthalmology,9110772,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (wolframin protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Diabetes Insipidus/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Hearing Loss, Sensorineural/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Fibers/pathology', 'Optic Atrophies, Hereditary', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/pathology', 'Tomography, Optical Coherence', 'Vision Disorders/*physiopathology', 'Visual Acuity/physiology', 'Visual Fields/physiology', 'Wolfram Syndrome/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['DIDMOAD', 'WFS1 gene', 'hereditary optic neuropathy', 'optic atrophy', 'optical coherence tomography angiography']",2019/04/09 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2019/04/09 06:00'],"['2019/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1120672119842489 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Ophthalmol. 2020 Sep;30(5):1099-1105. doi: 10.1177/1120672119842489.

METHODS: Descriptive, cross-sectional observational design. The sample consisted of 50 patients diagnosed with WS. Clinical criteria contributing to WS diagnosis were analyzed: diabetes mellitus (DM), optic nerve atrophy (OA), sensorineural deafness, urological and neurological dysfunction, among others. These parameters were assessed according to their presence/absence, age of onset, and various clinical-analytical parameters. RESULTS: All the patients studied presented DM and OA, with a mean age of onset of 5.4 +/- .9 (1-14) years and 9 +/- .9 (1-16) years, respectively. The remaining criteria were present with a variable frequency: 77% had diabetes insipidus, 66.7% auditory alterations, 77.8% neurogenic bladder, 61.1% neurological involvement, and 27.8% hypogonadism. A 16.7% of the patients had positive albuminuria (urinary albumin/creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g) and 72.2% had hyporreflexia. There were no significant differences in the age of diagnosis nor of the presence of different pathologies according to sex. CONCLUSIONS: The early presence of a non-autoimmune insulin dependent DM, should alert us of an ""infrequent"" diabetes syndrome. Wolfram's presumptive diagnosis could be established if juvenile-onset DM occurs concomitantly with OA, and this visual impairment is not attributable to diabetic retinopathy. Despite the long period of evolution of DM and altered values of HbA1c, the prevalence of microvascular complications in the sample are low.",,"['Bueno, Gema Esteban', 'Ruiz-Castaneda, Dyanne', 'Martinez, Javier Ruiz', 'Munoz, Manuel Romero', 'Alascio, Pedro Carrillo']","['Bueno GE', 'Ruiz-Castaneda D', 'Martinez JR', 'Munoz MR', 'Alascio PC']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4432-7705'],"['Clinical Management Unit Garrucha, Area of Health Management North of Almeria, Spanish Association for Research and Help to Wolfram Syndrome, Garrucha, Spain. gema.esteban.bueno@gmail.com.', 'Andalusian Public Foundation for the Biosanitary Research of Eastern Andalusia-Alejandro Otero, Spanish Association for Research and Help to Wolfram Syndrome, Andalucia, Spain.', 'CIBERNED, Donostia University Hospital Neurology Service Area of Neurosciences Biodonostia Research Institute, San Sebastian, Spain.', 'Endocrinology and Nutrition Unit, Rafael Mendez Hospital, Granada, Spain.', 'Clinical Management Unit, Internal Medicine Hospital La Inmaculada, Area of Health Management North of Almeria, Almeria, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",United States,Endocrine,Endocrine,9434444,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Diabetes Insipidus/etiology', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*etiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Hearing Loss, Sensorineural/etiology', 'Humans', 'Hypogonadism/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Optic Atrophy/*etiology', 'Symptom Assessment', 'Wolfram Syndrome/complications/*diagnosis', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['DIDMOAD', 'Diabetes mellitus', 'Neurodegeneration', 'Optic atrophy', 'Sensorineural deafness', 'Wolfram syndrome']",2018/05/08 06:00,2019/01/30 06:00,['2018/05/06 06:00'],"['2018/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12020-018-1608-2 [pii]', '10.1007/s12020-018-1608-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrine. 2018 Sep;61(3):440-446. doi: 10.1007/s12020-018-1608-2.

Reports of cranial LCH in the adult population are extremely rare. Although surgery remains the preferred option for localized LCH lesions, the role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is emerging. OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively review a rare case series to determine the safety and effectiveness of SRS for patients with localized cranial LCH. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed histopathologically confirmed cases of localized cranial LCH treated with SRS at our institute in the adult population between January 2005 and September 2022. Five patients were identified with a median age of 34 years (19-54 years). The tumor location was in the pituitary stalk in 3 patients, the orbit in one patient, and the parietal skull in one patient. The median target volume was 2.8 cc (range: 0.37-6.11). Treatment was delivered in a single fraction in 4 patients (median margin dose of 8 Gy, range: 7-10 Gy) and in 3 fractions (22.5 Gy) in 1 patient. The median follow-up was 12 years (range: 4-17). None of the patients required craniotomy for tumor debulking before or after SRS. RESULTS: The local tumor control rate for the lesions was 100%. All 3 patients with LCH in the pituitary stalk had diabetes insipidus at the initial presentation and developed panhypopituitarism after SRS. Diabetes insipidus was not improved after SRS. The other 2 patients presented no adverse radiation effects. Based on the literature review, our case series was the largest retrospective series on SRS for localized cranial LCH, with the longest median follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: SRS for patients with localized cranial LCH was a safe and effective treatment modality in this case series. Larger studies are encouraged to validate the role of SRS in the treatment of localized cranial LCH.",['Copyright (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

There was a good correlation (r = -0.93) between the rates of change of plasma sodium and blood glucose concentrations, and thus a rise in plasma sodium concentration appeared to be a consequence of the treatment. In the early phase of treatment urinary sodium loss was extremely low despite a brisk diuresis, the infused sodium then predisposing the patients to hypernatraemia. All of the eight patients with intracranial disorders showed evidence of abnormal production of the antidiuretic hormone, six having frank diabetes insipidus. Severe hypernatraemia in this group was associated with a high mortality, fluid balance being difficult to maintain. Two of the four patients who had become dehydrated had had a recent gastrointestinal haemorrhage.

Vasopressin (VP), which is elevated in type I and type II DM, has been shown to increase glomerular filtration rate in normal rats and to contribute to progression of chronic renal failure in 5/6 nephrectomized rats. The present study was thus designed to evaluate whether VP contributes to the renal disorders of DM. Renal function was compared in Brattleboro rats with diabetes insipidus (DI) lacking VP and in normal Long-Evans (LE) rats, with or without streptozotocin-induced DM. Blood and urine were collected after 2 and 4 weeks of DM, and creatinine clearance, urinary glucose and albumin excretion, and kidney weight were measured. Plasma glucose increased 3-fold in DM rats of both strains, but glucose excretion was approximately 40% lower in DI-DM than in LE-DM, suggesting less intense metabolic disorders. Creatinine clearance increased significantly in LE-DM (P < 0.01) but failed to increase in DI-DM. Urinary albumin excretion more than doubled in LE-DM but rose by only 34% in DI-DM rats (P < 0.05). Kidney hypertrophy was also less intense in DI-DM than in LE-DM (P < 0.001). These results suggest that VP plays a critical role in diabetic hyperfiltration and albuminuria induced by DM. This hormone thus seems to be an additional risk factor for diabetic nephropathy and, thus, a potential target for prevention and/or therapeutic intervention.",,"['Bardoux, P', 'Martin, H', 'Ahloulay, M', 'Schmitt, F', 'Bouby, N', 'Trinh-Trang-Tan, M M', 'Bankir, L']","['Bardoux P', 'Martin H', 'Ahloulay M', 'Schmitt F', 'Bouby N', 'Trinh-Trang-Tan MM', 'Bankir L']",,"['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Unite 367, 17, Rue du Fer a Moulin 75005 Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['11000-17-2 (Vasopressins)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",IM,"['*Albuminuria', 'Animals', 'Creatinine/metabolism', 'Diabetes Insipidus/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Diabetic Nephropathies/*physiopathology', '*Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glycosuria', 'Hypertrophy', 'Kidney/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Nephrectomy', 'Organ Size', 'Rats', 'Rats, Brattleboro', 'Rats, Long-Evans', 'Vasopressins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology']",PMC17899,,,1999/09/01 00:00,1999/09/01 00:01,['1999/09/01 00:00'],"['1999/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0744 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.96.18.10397 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Aug 31;96(18):10397-402. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.18.10397.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the age of 17 months he had been referred to the pediatric endocrinologist because of polyuria and polydipsia in order to exclude diabetes insipidus. Repeated water deprivation tests and a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain were normal. Diabetes insipidus was excluded, and primary polydipsia was thought to be most likely since diabetes mellitus also had been excluded. At the current presentation, he drank up to 3 L a day and quite often had wet diapers. He also seemed to pass stools infrequently and with difficulty. Curiously his grandmother had similar symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia since childhood and had been diagnosed with primary polydipsia. The physical examination of our pediatric patient was normal. In the differential diagnosis we included diabetes insipidus but also contemplated other possibilities, such as nephronophthisis, tubulopathies and hypercalciuria. Laboratory results including urinalysis and an ultrasound of the kidney did not show any abnormalities, making a tubulopathy or hypercalciuria unlikely. A desmopressin test by the intravenous route came back completely normal, pointing to another cause than diabetes insipidus. Genetic testing for the nephronophthisis came back negative but was positive for a missense mutation in the AVPR2 gene (p.Arg104Cys) associated with partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. He was started on daily desmopressin. Within 3 days the urinary incontinence resolved as did the polyuria and faecal incontinence. His grandmother was referred to the geneticist and eventually the adult nephrologist. This case highlights the importance of being thorough when confronted with a difficult diagnosis. It also emphasizes that a test result does not necessarily equate to the presence or absence of a condition since the test with 100 % sensitivity and specificity has yet to be discovered.",,"['Keenswijk, Werner', 'Walle, Johan Vande']","['Keenswijk W', 'Walle JV']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium. keenswijkwerner@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.

In the pedigrees presented, the disease clearly followed an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Linkage analysis was performed in one large family by calculating lod scores for linkage between loci for cranial diabetes insipidus and 18 polymorphic markers and chromosome heteromorphisms. No significant genetic linkage was found and only one of the polymorphic markers gave a positive hint of linkage. A water deprivation test was performed in nine patients from three of the families and in healthy control subjects. The plasma concentration of arginine vasopressin was very low or undetectable in the patients, and unlike the control subjects did not increase significantly during water deprivation. Arginine vasopressin and serum osmolality (Sosm) were significantly positively correlated in the controls, but not in the patients. The results indicated that an arginine vasopressin-level lower than 2 pg/ml strongly suggests a diagnosis of cranial diabetes insipidus if at the same time Sosm is higher than 295 mosmol/kg.

Here, we report the case of a Lebanese patient diagnosed with juvenile-onset insulin-dependent diabetes presenting ketoacidosis, early-onset retinopathy with optic atrophy, hearing loss, diabetes insipidus, epilepsy, and normal weight and stature, who later developed insulin resistance. Despite similarities with Wolfram syndrome, we excluded the WFS1 gene as responsible for this disease. Using combined linkage and candidate gene study, we selected ALMS1, responsible for Alstrom syndrome, as a candidate gene. We identified a novel splice mutation in intron 18 located 3 bp before the intron-exon junction (IVS18-3T>G), resulting in exon 19 skipping and consequent frameshift generating a truncated protein (V3958fs3964X). The clinical presentation of the patient significantly differed from typical Alstrom syndrome by the absence of truncal obesity and short stature, and by the presence of ketoacidotic insulin-dependent diabetes, optic atrophy and diabetes insipidus.

However, in infancy polyuria may be absent because of dehydration and reduced glomerular filtration rate. In 2 cases the main presenting feature was hypotonia, with marked head lag. Family studies confirmed the X-linked mode of inheritance of the disease; in case 1 the disease appeared to have arisen as a new mutation in the mother, and in case 2 the carrier status was traced back to the great-grandmother. Pitfalls in the diagnosis and detection of the carriers are discussed. Treatment with thiazide diuretics and prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors is effective in reducing urine volumes and polydipsia.

The phenotypic spectrum is very heterogeneous, with non-autoimmune juvenile-onset diabetes and optic atrophy as minimal criteria for the diagnosis. Biallelic mutations in the WFS1 gene are the causative genetic anomaly for the syndrome, with, however, no evident genotype-phenotype correlation. Among the clinical features of the disease, diabetic retinopathy depicts a rarely reported microvascular complication. In this report, we describe the clinical and genetic findings in a 26-year-old patient presenting with Wolfram syndrome and severe diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: The mutation screening was performed by polymerase chain reaction followed by Sanger sequencing of the entire coding sequence of the WFS1 gene. RESULTS: A novel homozygous missense variant c.1901A>T (p.Lys634Met) was found in the proband and classified as probably pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular study of the WFS1 gene is essential for the diagnostic confirmation, to provide appropriate genetic counseling and a mutational screening in the at-risk relatives. The c.1901A>T (p.Lys634 Met) is a novel variant that could be responsible for a severe form of Wolfram syndrome with early and proliferative diabetic retinopathy.",,"['Maamouri, Rym', 'Hizem, Syrine', 'Kammoun, Ines', 'Elaribi, Yasmina', 'Rejeb, Imen', 'Sebai, Molka', 'Jilani, Houweyda', 'Rouzier, Cecile', 'Cheour, Monia', 'Paquis-Flucklinger, Veronique', 'Ben Jemaa, Lamia']","['Maamouri R', 'Hizem S', 'Kammoun I', 'Elaribi Y', 'Rejeb I', 'Sebai M', 'Jilani H', 'Rouzier C', 'Cheour M', 'Paquis-Flucklinger V', 'Ben Jemaa L']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7720-1279'],"['Department of Ophthalmology, Habib Thameur hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of congenital and hereditary diseases, Mongi Slim hospital, La Marsa, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of endocrinology and metabolic diseases, National Institute ""Zouhair Kallel"" of Nutrition, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of congenital and hereditary diseases, Mongi Slim hospital, La Marsa, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of congenital and hereditary diseases, Mongi Slim hospital, La Marsa, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of congenital and hereditary diseases, Mongi Slim hospital, La Marsa, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of congenital and hereditary diseases, Mongi Slim hospital, La Marsa, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, National Center for Mitochondrial Diseases, Nice Teaching Hospital, Nice, France.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Habib Thameur hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, National Center for Mitochondrial Diseases, Nice Teaching Hospital, Nice, France.', 'Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of congenital and hereditary diseases, Mongi Slim hospital, La Marsa, Tunis, Tunisia.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Ophthalmic Genet,Ophthalmic genetics,9436057,['0 (wolframin protein)'],IM,"['Humans', '*Diabetic Retinopathy/diagnosis/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Mutation, Missense', '*Optic Atrophy/genetics', '*Wolfram Syndrome/diagnosis/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['WFS1 gene', 'Wolfram syndrome', 'diabetes mellitus', 'diabetic retinopathy', 'genetic variation']",2022/09/13 06:00,2023/05/22 06:42,['2022/09/12 07:53'],"['2023/05/22 06:42 [medline]', '2022/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/09/12 07:53 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13816810.2022.2113546 [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Genet. 2023 Jun;44(3):304-312. doi: 10.1080/13816810.2022.2113546.

More and more, the discovery of relevant biomarkers is aided by in silico techniques based on applying data mining and computational chemistry on large molecular databases. However, there is an even larger source of valuable information available that can potentially be tapped for such discoveries: repositories constituted by research documents. RESULTS: This paper reports on a pilot experiment to discover potential novel biomarkers and phenotypes for diabetes and obesity by self-organized text mining of about 120,000 PubMed abstracts, public clinical trial summaries, and internal Merck research documents. These documents were directly analyzed by the InfoCodex semantic engine, without prior human manipulations such as parsing. Recall and precision against established, but different benchmarks lie in ranges up to 30% and 50% respectively. Retrieval of known entities missed by other traditional approaches could be demonstrated. Finally, the InfoCodex semantic engine was shown to discover new diabetes and obesity biomarkers and phenotypes. Amongst these were many interesting candidates with a high potential, although noticeable noise (uninteresting or obvious terms) was generated. CONCLUSIONS: The reported approach of employing autonomous self-organising semantic engines to aid biomarker discovery, supplemented by appropriate manual curation processes, shows promise and has potential to impact, conservatively, a faster alternative to vocabulary processes dependent on humans having to read and analyze all the texts. More optimistically, it could impact pharmaceutical research, for example to shorten time-to-market of novel drugs, or speed up early recognition of dead ends and adverse reactions.",,"['Trugenberger, Carlo A', 'Walti, Christoph', 'Peregrim, David', 'Sharp, Mark E', 'Bureeva, Svetlana']","['Trugenberger CA', 'Walti C', 'Peregrim D', 'Sharp ME', 'Bureeva S']",,"['InfoCodex AG, Semantic Technologies, Buchs (SG), Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['*Biomarkers', 'Data Mining/*methods', 'Diabetes Insipidus/diagnosis', 'Diabetes Mellitus/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Obesity/diagnosis', '*Phenotype', 'PubMed', 'Semantics', 'Vocabulary, Controlled']",PMC3605201,,,2013/02/14 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/02/14 06:00'],"['2012/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-14-51 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-14-51 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2013 Feb 13;14:51. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-14-51.,20130213,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increased rma of the PVN and PN produced by water deprivation in Severe mice was not reduced to normal by injection of dDAVP.

This syndrome is included among the genetic disorders associated with diabetes in the American Diabetes Association's classification. WS is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by various clinical manifestations such as diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, diabetes insipidus, deafness, neurological symptoms, renal tract abnormalities, psychiatric disorders and gonadal disorders. The most frequent of these disorders is early onset diabetes mellitus, with a low prevalence of ketoacidosis, and optic atrophy, which is considered a key diagnostic criterion in this syndrome. Diabetes insipidus usually develops later. This syndrome manifests in childhood, hampering diagnosis and treatment. Morbidity and mortality are high and quality of life is impaired due to neurological and urological complications. This article describes the clinical characteristics and outcome in three patients with WS. All three patients had antecedents of consanguinity. Genetic study was performed in all patients.

It is now well recognized that hypoxia is an important environmental stimulus capable of modulating the expression of many genes involved in energy metabolism. The diabetic metabolic stress resulting from impaired energy metabolism, which produce altered production of inflammatory mediators, may increase the risk of oxidative injury. The aim was to investigate whether production of MIP-2 and MCP-1 are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes, and if the regulatory effects of these chemokines are affected by hypoxia. Two groups of rats, diabetic and non-diabetic, were kept in normoxic room air conditions or subjected to chronic hypoxia. Expression and production of chemokines were measured by RT-PCR and ELISA assay. In diabetic rats, we found a marked increase of MCP-1 when compared with non-diabetic rats (783.5+/- 49 versus 461.9 +/- 27), while no significant differences were detected for MIP-2 levels. Hypoxia selectively modulated chemokines production, since MCP-1 expression and production was up-regulated in the diabetic groups (783.5+/- 49 versus 461.9+/- 27), but down-regulated MIP-2 expression and production (87.8+/- 23 versus 522.1+/- 72). Our data point to MCP-1 and MIP-2 as important components in the pathophysiology of diabetes, and hypoxia is an important and potent environmental stimulus capable of modulating the expression and production of these chemokines.","['(Mol Cell Biochem 276: 105-111, 2005).']","['Marisa, Cacchio', 'Lucci, Isabella', 'Di Giulio, Camillo', 'Bianchi, Giuseppina', 'Grilli, Alfredo', 'Patruno, Antonia', 'Reale, Marcella']","['Marisa C', 'Lucci I', 'Di Giulio C', 'Bianchi G', 'Grilli A', 'Patruno A', 'Reale M']",,"['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University ""G.

It is caused by mutations in WFS1 or CISD2 genes. More than 200 different variations in WFS1 have been described in patients with Wolfram syndrome, which complicates the establishment of clear genotype-phenotype correlation. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of WFS1 mutations and update the natural history of the disease. METHODS: This study analyzed clinical and genetic data of 412 patients with Wolfram syndrome published in the last 15 years. RESULTS: (i) 15% of published patients do not fulfill the current -inclusion criterion; (ii) genotypic prevalence differences may exist among countries; (iii) diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy might not be the first two clinical features in some patients; (iv) mutations are nonuniformly distributed in WFS1; (v) age at onset of diabetes mellitus, hearing defects, and diabetes insipidus may depend on the patient's genotypic class; and (vi) disease progression rate might depend on genotypic class. CONCLUSION: New genotype-phenotype correlations were established, disease progression rate for the general population and for the genotypic classes has been calculated, and new diagnostic criteria have been proposed.

In one patient hydronephrosis was present. Both patients suffered from mild gestational diabetes mellitus. Plasma sodium was 145 and 162 mmol/l. Polyuria and urinary hypo-osmolality responded well to desmopressin acetate. After delivery, polyuria and polydipsia disappeared in one patient and significantly improved in the other. Infusion of hypertonic saline one and two weeks respectively after delivery led to plasma hyper-osmolality (294 mosmol/kg and 305 mosmol/kg) without detectable stimulation of arginine vasopressin (AVP). Anterior pituitary function was normal. No stimulation of AVP occurred following insulin-induced hypoglycemia. AVP plasma disappearance after i.v. pulse injection of 1 microgram AVP as well as AVP plasma concentration after continuous infusion of 10 ng AVP/min was studied two weeks after delivery in one patient. The results suggested markedly elevated degradation of AVP compared to control subjects, probably due to an increased vasopressin activity. Eight months after delivery, hypertonic saline infusion in one patient led to a plasma-osmolality of 312 mosmol/kg without stimulation of AVP. In the second patient, AVP was not detectable (less than 0.2 pg/ml) six months after delivery when plasma osmolality was 290 mosmol/kg. Our studies demonstrate that a subclinical compensated diabetes insipidus was preexistent in both patients.

AIM: Aims of the present paper are to ascertain WS prevalence and expression in a district of North-eastern Sicily, i.e. a geographic area where consanguineous unions are not very unusual. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prevalence rates of WS in the Messina district were calculated by taking into consideration both the total population (653,737) and the populations included within the 0-30 year age range (202,681). We estimated the relative prevalence of WS among patients with youth-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM) who are currently aged under 30 years (256). RESULTS: Global WS prevalence in our district is 1:54,478, whereas prevalence among individuals under 30 is 1:16,890 and relative prevalence among patients with juvenile-onset insulin-dependent DM is 1:22.3. When compared with the patients with insulin-dependent DM of Messina district, WS patients did not exhibit significant differences in terms of biochemical features at DM onset, whereas age at DM diagnosis was significantly earlier in WS group. CONCLUSIONS: (a) WS prevalence is not so infrequent as generally expected; (b) in our series, DM presented before 10 years in 11/12 patients and ten cases have already developed all the four peculiar manifestations of WS by 26 years; (c) 9/12 patients exhibited a homozygous frameshift/truncation mutation (Y454_L459del_fsX454), which is the one most frequently found also in patients from other Italian regions; (d) age at DM diagnosis was significantly earlier in WS group than in the patients with insulin-dependent DM of Messina district.",,"['Lombardo, F', 'Salzano, G', 'Di Bella, C', 'Aversa, T', 'Pugliatti, F', 'Cara, S', 'Valenzise, M', 'De Luca, F', 'Rigoli, L']","['Lombardo F', 'Salzano G', 'Di Bella C', 'Aversa T', 'Pugliatti F', 'Cara S', 'Valenzise M', 'De Luca F', 'Rigoli L']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Messina, Via Consolare Valeria 1, 98125, Messina, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,J Endocrinol Invest,Journal of endocrinological investigation,7806594,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consanguinity', 'Diabetes Insipidus/epidemiology/genetics', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/epidemiology/genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Sicily/epidemiology', 'Wolfram Syndrome/complications/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,,2014/02/06 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/02/06 06:00'],"['2013/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40618-013-0039-4 [doi]'],ppublish,J Endocrinol Invest. 2014 Feb;37(2):195-202. doi: 10.1007/s40618-013-0039-4.

Our patient has diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, abnormal audiograms, without subjective evidence of hearing loss, and dilatation of the urinary tract. Diagnosis was suspected at the age of 8 years. Diabetes mellitus was the first manifestation and treatment with insulin was necessary. Desmopressin therapy decreased dramatically the daily urinary output. In view of the significant morbidity and mortality from renal failure associated with recurrent urinary infections, we have drawn special attention to the urological manifestations of the syndrome. During the follow-up, the patients underwent some investigations, such as renal ultrasound and echotomography and cystourethroscopy. Outstanding results of these studies are severe bilateral hydronephrosis with dilatated ureters and loss of renal tissue.

Combined with the clinical data of 8 cases of WFS which had been reported in China between 1994 and 2007, the clinical characteristics of WFS were reviewed. RESULTS: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as the earliest manifestation was found in all of the 9 patients, with a median onset age of 5.0 years. Optic atrophy occurred in 8 patients (onset age: 8.5 years), diabetes insipidus in 7 patients (onset age: 8.5 years) and deafness in 7 patients (onset age: 9.8 years).

On the occasion of a new case report we remind the main characteristics of this syndrome. The SW is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the coexistence of diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic atrophy and deafness. Several other manifestations are frequently associated: neurological, urologic and endocrinous abnormalities as well as growth troubles. Only diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy are compulsory for the diagnosis. This Syndrome is transmitted to the autosomic recessive mode. Mitochondrial heredity is in the course of study. The systematic practice of a cerebral IRM during a SW allows finding several malformative abnormalities of which the most typical is the agenesis of the post-pituitary gland.

When measured along the corticopapillary axis, each exhibits a specific distribution pattern, indicating a specific localization and function. Studying their behaviour under vasopressin treatment in diabetes insipidus rats and after insulin treatment in diabetes mellitus rats confirmed this conclusion: AVP led to a steady increase of sorbitol and glycerophosphorylcholine over 7 days with no effect on inositol levels. Insulin treatment of diabetic rats, on the other hand, decreased sorbitol with a concomitant increase in glycerophosphorylcholine, again without any effect on tubular inositol concentrations.

The diagnosis of acute and chronic sequelae is one of the challenges of COVID-19. The current literature proposes that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may involve the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In this case report, we present a unique case of new-onset central diabetes insipidus secondary to the COVID-19 disease in a 54-year-old woman. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old woman presented with the history of excessive thirst, polyuria, and polydipsia, six weeks after being infected by COVID-19. Laboratory tests revealed low urine osmolarity and increased serum osmolarity, and the patient was diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus. After administration of nasal desmopressin, urinary osmolarity increased, and the patient's symptoms improved. However, to stabilize her condition, desmopressin treatment was required. CONCLUSIONS: We reported a unique case of diabetes insipidus in a COVID-19 patient. Central diabetes insipidus may be included in clinical manifestations of the COVID-19, in case of new-onset polyuria and polydipsia following COVID-19 disease. Nevertheless, a causal relationship has not been established between the symptoms of the patient and the SARS-CoV-2 infection.",['(c) 2022.

However, these data were not conclusive because either observations were only anecdotic or did not match with control type 1 diabetic populations. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A group of 26 French diabetic patients with DIDMOAD was compared with a population of 52 patients with common type 1 diabetes matched for age at diabetes diagnosis (8.62 +/- 1.84 vs. 8.27 +/- 1.30 years; P = NS) and diabetes duration (12.88 +/- 1.58 vs. 12.87 +/- 1.13 years; P = NS) to study the quality of glycemic control and the incidence of microvascular complications. RESULTS: Glycemic control was significantly better in the DIDMOAD group than in the type 1 diabetic group (A1C: 7.72 +/- 0.21 vs. 8.99 +/- 0.25%, respectively; P = 0.002), with significant lower daily insulin requirements (0.71 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.88 +/- 0.04 UI x kg(-1) x day(-1), respectively; P = 0.0325). The prevalence of microvascular complications in the DIDMOAD group was half that observed in the type 1 diabetic group, but the difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes in DIDMOAD patients is more easily controlled despite the presence of other handicaps. This better glycemic control could explain the trend to decreased microvascular diabetes complications observed in previous studies.",,"['Cano, Aline', 'Molines, Laurent', 'Valero, Rene', 'Simonin, Gilbert', 'Paquis-Flucklinger, Veronique', 'Vialettes, Bernard']","['Cano A', 'Molines L', 'Valero R', 'Simonin G', 'Paquis-Flucklinger V', 'Vialettes B']",,"['Department of Nutrition, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology, University of Mediterranee, La Timone Hospital, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Diabetes Care,Diabetes care,7805975,['0 (Blood Glucose)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Blood Glucose/analysis', 'Child', 'Diabetic Angiopathies/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microcirculation/physiopathology', 'Time Factors', 'Wolfram Syndrome/*complications']",,,,2007/05/31 09:00,2007/09/07 09:00,['2007/05/31 09:00'],"['2007/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['dc07-0380 [pii]', '10.2337/dc07-0380 [doi]']",ppublish,Diabetes Care. 2007 Sep;30(9):2327-30. doi: 10.2337/dc07-0380.

The aim of this study was to look for AVP cell antibodies (AVP-cell-Ab) in human sera of a large population of autoimmune endocrine disease patients without diabetes insipidus and to test whether an occurrence of these antibodies in some patients can be associated with partial impairment of posterior pituitary function. MEASUREMENT: Sera from 410 patients (310 females, 100 males, age range 10-46 years) with autoimmune endocrine disorders (260 with thyroid autoimmune disease, and 150 with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus) without clinical diabetes insipidus, and from 100 normal subjects, were investigated for hypothalamic autoantibodies by an indirect immunofluorescence method. Positive sera were subsequently tested with specific rabbit anti AVP serum. RESULTS: None of controls, but five out of 410 patients (1.2%) were AVP-cell-Ab positive. All positive and nine negative from the 410 screened patients were tested for posterior pituitary function. Two out of five AVP-cell-Ab positive patients showed partial diabetes insipidus. CONCLUSION: AVP cell antibodies can be shown in some patients with endocrine autoimmune disease without diabetes insipidus and can sometimes be associated with findings of partial posterior pituitary dysfunction. This suggests that clinical diabetes insipidus could be preceded by a long subclinical period characterized only by the occurrence of AVP-cell-Ab in the sera associated or followed by alterations in functional tests.

Still, it raises potential safety concerns about the subsequent enhancement of associated immunopathology. Increasing evidence shows that the endocrine system, including the hypophysis, may be involved in COVID-19. Moreover, occasional but increasing reports of endocrine disorders involving the thyroid have been reported after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Among them, a few cases encompass the pituitary. Here we report a rare case of central diabetes insipidus following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 59-year-old female patient with a 25-year history of Crohn's disease in long-term remission, who presented with sudden onset of polyuria eight weeks after administration of an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Laboratory evaluation was consistent with isolated central diabetes insipidus. Magnetic resonance imaging displayed involvement of the infundibulum and the posterior hypophysis. Eighteen months after the vaccination, she is still under desmopressin treatment and had stable pituitary stalk thickening on magnetic resonance imaging. Although Crohn's disease-associated hypophysitis has been reported, it is scarce. In the absence of other recognizable causes of hypophysitis, we believe the involvement of the hypophysis in our patient may have been triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: We report a rare case of central diabetes insipidus potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Further studies are needed to understand better the mechanisms underlying autoimmune endocrinopathies development in the context of COVID-19 infection and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.",['(c) 2023.

It would be another century before diabetes insipidus was identified from the insipid rather than saccharine taste of urine in cases of polyuria. After its increased recognition, pathologic observations and experimental studies connected diabetes insipidus to the pituitary gland in the opening decades of the 20th century. Simultaneously, posterior pituitary lobe extracts were shown to be vasoconstrictive (vasopressin) and antidiuretic (antidiuretic hormone). As vasopressin was purified and synthesized and its assay became available, it was shown to be released in response to both osmotic and volume stimuli that are integrated in the hypothalamus, and vasopressin thereby was essential to maintaining internal water balance. The antidiuretic properties of vasopressin to treat the rare cases of diabetes insipidus were of limited clinical utility until its vasoconstrictive effects were resuscitated in the 1970s, with the consequent increasing wider use of vasopressin for the treatment of compromised hemodynamic states. In addition, the discovery of antidiuretic hormone receptor blockers has led to their increasing use in managing hypo-osmolar states.","['Copyright (c) 2010 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

It is characterized by diabetes insipidus (DI), diabetes mellitus (DM), optic atrophy (OA), and sensorineural hearing loss (D) (DIDMOAD). The clinical picture may be complicated by other symptoms, such as urinary tract, endocrinological, psychiatric, and neurological abnormalities. WS1 is caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene located on chromosome 4p16 that encodes a transmembrane protein named wolframin. Many studies have shown that wolframin regulates some mechanisms of ER calcium homeostasis and therefore plays a role in cellular apoptosis. More than 200 mutations are responsible for WS1. However, abnormal phenotypes of WS with or without DM, inherited in an autosomal dominant mode and associated with one or more WFS1 mutations, have been found. Furthermore, recessive Wolfram-like disease without DM has been described. The prognosis of WS1 is poor, and the death occurs prematurely. Although there are no therapies that can slow or stop WS1, a careful clinical monitoring can help patients during the rapid progression of the disease, thus improving their quality of life. In this review, we describe natural history and etiology of WS1 and suggest criteria for a most pertinent approach to the diagnosis and clinical follow up. We also describe the hallmarks of new therapies for WS1.",,"['Rigoli, Luciana', 'Caruso, Valerio', 'Salzano, Giuseppina', 'Lombardo, Fortunato']","['Rigoli L', 'Caruso V', 'Salzano G', 'Lombardo F']",,"['Department of Human Pathology of Adulthood and Childhood G.

Finally, pre-existing central or nephrogenic DI may occasionally be unmasked by pregnancy. Treatment with dDAVP (desmopressin, Minirin((R))) is very effective on transient DI of pregnancy and also on pre-existing or acquired central DI.

The causative gene for WS1 (WFS1) encoding wolframin maps to chromosome 4p16.1. Wolframin has an important function in maintaining the homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in pancreatic beta cells. Recently, another causative gene, CISD2, has been identified in patients with a type of Wolfram syndrome (WS2) resulting in early optic atrophy, diabetes mellitus, deafness, decreased lifespan, but not diabetes insipidus. The CISD2-encoded protein ERIS (endoplasmic reticulum intermembrane small protein) also localizes to ER, but does not interact directly with wolframin. ERIS maps to chromosome 4q22. RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous studies have shown an interesting similarity between WFS1 and CISD2 genes. Experimental studies demonstrated that the Cisd2 knockout (Cisd2) mouse shows premature aging and typical symptoms of Wolfram syndrome. These researches provide interesting insight into the relation of neurodegenerative diseases, mitochondrial disorders, and autophagy and are useful for the pathophysiological understanding of both Wolfram syndrome and mitochondrial-mediated premature aging. SUMMARY: The knowledge of WS1 and WS2 pathogenesis, and of the interactions between WFS1 and CISD2 genes, is useful for accurate diagnostic classification and for diagnosis of presymptomatic individuals.",,"['Rigoli, Luciana', 'Di Bella, Chiara']","['Rigoli L', 'Di Bella C']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Medical School, University of Messina, Messina, Italy. luciana.rigoli@unime.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (wolframin protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/diagnosis/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Optic Atrophy/diagnosis/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype', 'Wolfram Syndrome/diagnosis/*genetics/physiopathology']",,,,2012/07/14 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/07/14 06:00'],"['2012/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['00008480-201208000-00014 [pii]', '10.1097/MOP.0b013e328354ccdf [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2012 Aug;24(4):512-7. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0b013e328354ccdf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There would be a high index of clinical suspicion for WS when clinical manifestations of type 1 diabetes and optic atrophy present together. Genetic analysis is often required to confirm the diagnosis. We describe a pair of Chinese siblings diagnosed with WS at ages 20 and 24 years, respectively. DNA sequencing of the WFS1 gene which encodes for Wolframin ER Transmembrane Glycoprotein identified a heterozygous nonsense variant NM_006005.3: c.1999C>T p.(Gln667*) and a heterozygous missense variant c.2170C>T p.(Pro724Ser) in exon 8 of the gene for both siblings. There is no curative treatment for WS and management of this debilitating disease is aimed at treating individual clinical manifestations, slowing disease progression, and improving quality of life. Treatment with liraglutide, a glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonist, and tauroursodeoxycholic acid was started for the younger sibling, the proband. There was reduction in insulin requirements and improvement in glycemic control. The other sibling was not offered liraglutide due to her complex treatment regimen for end-organ failure. Genetic testing is a valuable tool to detect WS early to allow precise and prompt diagnosis, thereby facilitating the coordinated care from a multidisciplinary team of clinicians.",,"['Png, Doanna', 'Yeoh, Ester', 'Tan, Clara', 'Lim, Su Chi']","['Png D', 'Yeoh E', 'Tan C', 'Lim SC']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8677-8021', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1742-5817']","['Admiralty Medical Centre, Singapore.', 'Admiralty Medical Centre, Singapore.', 'Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore.', 'Admiralty Medical Centre, Singapore.', 'Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore.', 'National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,Journal of investigative medicine high impact case reports,101624758,['839I73S42A (Liraglutide)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Young Adult', '*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1', 'Liraglutide', '*Optic Atrophy/genetics', 'Quality of Life', '*Wolfram Syndrome/diagnosis/genetics/therapy']",PMC9846294,['NOTNLM'],"['WFS1 gene', 'Wolfram syndrome', 'diabetes mellitus', 'neurodegeneration', 'optic nerve atrophy']",2023/01/17 06:00,2023/01/18 06:00,['2023/01/16 04:13'],"['2023/01/16 04:13 [entrez]', '2023/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1177_23247096221150631 [pii]', '10.1177/23247096221150631 [doi]']",ppublish,J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep. 2023 Jan-Dec;11:23247096221150631. doi: 10.1177/23247096221150631.,,"['The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the', 'research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these, familial central diabetes insipidus shows an autosomal dominant inheritance. We herein report a case in which this disease was diagnosed based on a family history of nocturnal enuresis. A 40-year-old man had had symptoms of polydipsia, polyuria and nocturia since childhood and found that his daughter had the same symptoms. Despite reaching nine years old, his daughter's nocturnal enuresis still had not improved, resulting in her consulting a pediatrician. She was suspected of having familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) based on her family history and was referred along with her father for a detailed examination and treatment. A hypertonic saline load test (HSLT) to evaluate the arginine vasopressin (AVP) reaction was performed in both the proband and his daughter. The results showed no increase in AVP levels in response to high plasma osmolality. The water deprivation test (WDT) revealed he was suffering from partial DI. Based on the above findings and considering the possibility of familial central diabetes insipidus, we performed a gene mutation analysis of AVP-neurophysin II (NPII). Both the father and daughter had an exon 2 abnormality in this gene (c232_234delGAG; pGlu78del), and this gene mutation is known to cause NPII protein abnormality, abolishing the function of AVP as a carrier protein. This case was considered to have provided an opportunity to understand the role of an NPII gene abnormality in familial central diabetes insipidus.",,"['Sugawara, Lucia', 'Nakamura, Takaaki', 'Ishizuka, Yoshitaka', 'Maegawa, Hiroshi']","['Sugawara L', 'Nakamura T', 'Ishizuka Y', 'Maegawa H']",,"['Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Omihachiman Community Medical Center, Omihachiman, Shiga 523-0082, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Shiga 520-2092, Japan.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Omihachiman Community Medical Center, Omihachiman, Shiga 523-0082, Japan.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Omihachiman Community Medical Center, Omihachiman, Shiga 523-0082, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Shiga 520-2092, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Endocr J,Endocrine journal,9313485,"['0 (Neurophysins)', '113-79-1 (Arginine Vasopressin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Arginine Vasopressin', 'Child', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic/diagnosis/genetics', '*Diabetes Mellitus', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Neurophysins/genetics', '*Nocturnal Enuresis/etiology/genetics', 'Pedigree']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Arginine vasopressin', 'Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus', 'Neurophysin II', 'Polydipsia']",2021/09/22 06:00,2022/04/05 06:00,['2021/09/21 05:51'],"['2021/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/04/05 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/21 05:51 [entrez]']",['10.1507/endocrj.EJ21-0187 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocr J. 2022 Jan 28;69(1):95-100. doi: 10.1507/endocrj.EJ21-0187.

In rats suffering from an experimentally induced diabetes mellitus and in homozygous Brattleboro rats we observed a strong reduction in enzyme immunoreactivity in these nuclei. Since cathepsin L is capable of splitting certain hypothalamic neuropeptides that are changed in diabetic animals, a role of the enzyme in the metabolism of these peptides is imaginable.

Physical examination revealed lethargy, tachypnoea and 7% dehydration. Complete blood count and serum chemistry results were unremarkable, and venous blood gas analysis revealed hypokalaemia and hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap. Urinalysis revealed a urine specific gravity (USG) of 1.005, pH of 7.0 and proteinuria, and the bacterial culture was negative. Based on these results, the dog was diagnosed with distal renal tubular acidosis, and potassium citrate was prescribed to correct metabolic acidosis. In addition, concurrent diabetes insipidus (DI) was suspected because the dog showed persistent polyuria, polydipsia and a USG below 1.006 despite dehydration. After 3 days of initial treatment, acidosis was corrected, and vomiting resolved. Desmopressin acetate and hydrochlorothiazide were also prescribed for DI, but the USG was not normalized. Based on the insignificant therapeutic response, nephrogenic DI was highly suspected. DI was resolved after 24 days.

We report the post-mortem neuropathologic findings of a patient with Wolfram syndrome and correlate them with his clinical presentation. In the hypothalamus, neurons in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei were markedly decreased and minimal neurohypophyseal tissue remained in the pituitary. The pontine base and inferior olivary nucleus showed gross shrinkage and neuron loss, while the cerebellum was relatively unaffected. The visual system had moderate to marked loss of retinal ganglion neurons, commensurate loss of myelinated axons in the optic nerve, chiasm and tract, and neuron loss in the lateral geniculate nucleus but preservation of the primary visual cortex. The patient's inner ear showed loss of the organ of Corti in the basal turn of the cochleae and mild focal atrophy of the stria vascularis. These findings correlated well with the patient's high-frequency hearing loss. The pathologic findings correlated closely with the patient's clinical symptoms and further support the concept of Wolfram syndrome as a neurodegenerative disorder.

However, the risk factors for DI remain controversial. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients who underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma at our institution during a 5-year period. The patients were divided into a DI group and a non-DI group. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for postoperative DI. In subgroup analysis, the DI group was divided into transient DI and permanent DI groups, and perioperative factors were compared between groups. RESULTS: Of 101 patients, 58 were in the non-DI group (57.4%) and 43 were in the DI group (42.6%). Permanent DI occurred in 7 patients (6.9%). In univariate analyses, statistically significant risk factors were suprasellar extension, tumor functionality, and intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leaks by Esposito grade. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, Esposito grade was the only statistically significant risk factor (P = 0.015). The frequency of DI increased as the Esposito grade increased (P = 0.0002 for the trend). In subgroup analysis, postoperative nadir sodium concentration was lower in the permanent DI group (128.1 +/- 2.78 mmol/L) than in the transient DI group (135 +/- 1.22 mmol/L; P = 0.035), and the optimal cutoff value was 124.5 mmol/L, with a sensitivity of 57.1% and a specificity of 91.7% (area under the curve = 0.76, P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak by Esposito grade is associated with postoperative DI. These data can be applied to help identify high-risk patients who need more aggressive follow-up and fluid management.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We report, to our knowledge, the first case of Fournier's gangrene caused by C. ramosum in a female patient with multiple underlying conditions. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old woman with a 6-year history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus after total pancreatectomy and an 11-year history of central diabetes insipidus developed a pain in the genital area after a month of urinary catheter use. The lower abdominal pain worsened gradually over 2 weeks, and the pain, general fatigue, and loss of appetite prompted the patient's hospital admission. As she had severe edema in her pelvic and bilateral femoral areas, ceftriaxone was started empirically after collecting two sets of blood cultures. On hospital day 2, CT examination revealed the presence of necrotizing faciitis in the genital and pelvic areas, and the antibiotics were changed to a combination of meropenem, vancomycin, and clindamycin. Gram-positive cocci and gram-positive rods were isolated from blood cultures, which were finally identified as Streptococcus constellatus and C. ramosum using superoxide dismutase and 16S rDNA sequencing. An emergent surgery was performed on hospital day 2 to remove the affected tissue. Despite undergoing debridement and receiving combined antimicrobial chemotherapies, the patient's clinical improvement remained limited. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and she eventually died on hospital day 8. In the present case, the underlying diabetes mellitus, urinary incontinence due to central diabetes insipidus, undernutrition, and edema served as the predisposing conditions.

OBJECTIVE: This work aims to determine the cause of a novel form of familial diabetes insipidus (DI) that is controlled by desmopressin therapy but segregates in an X-linked recessive manner. METHODS: Thirteen members from 3 generations of the kindred with familial DI were studied. Water intake, urine volume, urine osmolality, plasma osmolality, and plasma vasopressin were measured under basal conditions, during fluid deprivation, 3% saline infusion, and water loading. Magnetic resonance images of the posterior pituitary also were obtained. In affected males, the effects of desmopressin therapy and linkage of the DI to markers for chromosome Xq28 were determined. In addition, the genes encoding vasopressin, aquaporin-2, the AVPR2 receptor, and its flanking regions were sequenced. RESULTS: This study showed that 4 males from 3 generations of the kindred have DI that is due to a deficiency of vasopressin, is corrected by standard doses of desmopressin, and segregates with markers for the AVPR2 gene in Xq28. However, no mutations were found in AVPR2 or its highly conserved flanking regions. Exome sequencing confirmed these findings and also revealed no deleterious variants in the provasopressin and aquaporin-2 genes. The 4 obligate female carriers osmo-regulated vasopressin in the low normal range. CONCLUSION: X-linked recessive transmission of DI can be due to a defect in either the secretion or the action of vasopressin. Other criteria are necessary to differentiate and manage the 2 disorders correctly.","['(c) The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the', 'Endocrine Society.

Early diagnosis and effective perioperative management of central DI is critical to minimize disruptions in fluid homeostasis. In particular, although venous thromboembolism (VTE) is generally less common in pediatric patients than their adult counterparts, isolated reports suggest that VTE occurs at a higher frequency in pediatric patients with central DI. METHODS: Using the PubMed, Scopus, and Springer Link databases, the authors performed a systematic review of the literature with regard to the incidence of VTE in pediatric patients with central DI. Inclusion criteria were availability of the full text in English, diagnosis of central DI and VTE in the same patient, and pediatric age defined as </= 21 years. Data were reported as median and interquartile range for continuous variables and as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Risk of bias assessments of the individual studies were performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists for case series and case reports. RESULTS: Of 2094 search results, 12 articles met the inclusion criteria and described a total of 17 cases of VTE in pediatric patients with central DI. Two additional patients from the authors' institution were added to this cohort. The underlying pathologies included craniopharyngioma (n = 6), suprasellar germinoma (n = 4), epileptic encephalopathy (n = 2), pilocytic astrocytoma (n = 2), prolactinoma (n = 2), Cushing disease (n = 1), failure to thrive (n = 1), and congenital hypothalamic syndrome (n = 1). Thrombotic complications included deep vein thrombosis (n = 10 [53%]), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (n = 6 [32%]), pulmonary embolism (n = 4 [21%]), inferior vena cava thrombosis (n = 2 [11%]), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (n = 1 [5%]). There was a 26% mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: VTE is a rare but potentially devastating postoperative complication that appears to have a higher incidence among patients with central DI. Although this review was limited by heterogeneous information across limited reports, pediatric neurosurgical patients with DI may benefit from more aggressive VTE surveillance and prophylaxis.",,"['Lambert, William A', 'Paro, Mitch', 'Pinci, Emanuela', 'Bookland, Markus J', 'Martin, Jonathan E', 'Riba-Wolman, Rebecca', 'McKay, Laura', 'Hersh, David S']","['Lambert WA', 'Paro M', 'Pinci E', 'Bookland MJ', 'Martin JE', 'Riba-Wolman R', 'McKay L', 'Hersh DS']",,"['1UConn School of Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut.', '1UConn School of Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut.', '2University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut.', ""3Division of Neurosurgery, Connecticut Children's, Hartford, Connecticut."", '4Department of Surgery, UConn School of Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut.', '5Department of Pediatrics, UConn School of Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut.', ""3Division of Neurosurgery, Connecticut Children's, Hartford, Connecticut."", '4Department of Surgery, UConn School of Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut.', '5Department of Pediatrics, UConn School of Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut.', ""6Division of Endocrinology, Connecticut Children's, Hartford, Connecticut."", ""7Division of Hematology/Oncology, Connecticut Children's, Hartford, Connecticut."", ""3Division of Neurosurgery, Connecticut Children's, Hartford, Connecticut."", '4Department of Surgery, UConn School of Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut.', '5Department of Pediatrics, UConn School of Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,J Neurosurg Pediatr,Journal of neurosurgery.

METHODS: Nine patients fulfilled the ascertainment criteria of WFS (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy). All patients were evaluated by the departments of paediatrics, ophthalmology, audiology, urology and medical biology. RESULTS: The earliest manifestation of WFS was insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (at a median age of 6.9 y), followed by optic atrophy (8.9 y), diabetes insipidus (10.2 y) and deafness (10.5 y). Short stature was found in five cases, delayed puberty in two cases and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in one case. Audiography disclosed hearing loss at high frequency in all patients (100%), but only five patients had clinical subjective hearing problems. Intravenous pyelography revealed hydroureteronephrosis in eight patients. Urodynamics revealed a normal bladder in only one patient. Three patients had a low-capacity, low-compliance bladder, detrusor external sphincteric dyssynergia and emptying problem, while five had an atonic bladder. Ocular findings were optic atrophy, low visual acuity and colour vision defects. Visual field tests revealed concentric and/or peripheral diminution in five patients. Visual evoked potentials were abnormal (reduced amplitude to both flash and pattern stimulation) in seven patients. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed mild or moderate atrophy of the optic nerves, chiasm, cerebellum, basal ganglia and brainstem in six patients; there was a partially empty sella in one case. There was no evidence of mitochondrial tRNA(Leu) (UUR) A to G (nucleotide 3243) mutation. CONCLUSION: Wolfram syndrome should be evaluated in a multidisciplinary manner. Some specific and dynamic tests are necessary to make a more precise estimate of the prevalence and median age of the components of WFS. Short stature is a common feature in WFS. Hypogonadism may be hypogonadotropic or hypergonadotropic. Bladder dysfunction does not always present as a large atonic bladder in WFS. A low-capacity, high-pressure bladder with sphincteric dyssynergia is also common.",,"['Simsek, E', 'Simsek, T', 'Tekgul, S', 'Hosal, S', 'Seyrantepe, V', 'Aktan, G']","['Simsek E', 'Simsek T', 'Tekgul S', 'Hosal S', 'Seyrantepe V', 'Aktan G']",,"['Department of Paediatric Endocrinology, Abant Izzet Baysal University School of Medicine, Duzce, Turkey. esimsek@ibuduzce-tip.edu.tr']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,"['9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Deafness/complications', 'Diabetes Insipidus/complications', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/complications', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Humans', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Male', 'Optic Atrophy/complications', '*Patient Care Team', 'Prevalence', 'Turkey/epidemiology', 'Visual Acuity/physiology', 'Wolfram Syndrome/epidemiology/*genetics']",,,,2003/03/26 04:00,2003/06/20 05:00,['2003/03/26 04:00'],"['2003/03/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1651-2227.2003.tb00469.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 2003;92(1):55-61. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2003.tb00469.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both patients developed mild renal dysfunction during the course of hyperparathyroidism. In the renal biopsy materials obtained from case 1, the renal interstitium showed chronic inflammatory changes. The tubules were partly damaged (focal necrosis). Deposition of calcium was sometimes noted within the mitochondria of the tubular epithelial cells. Some glomeruli showed glomerular sclerosis.

A recent study showed a role of AVP in haematopoiesis by stimulating red blood cell precursors, suggesting a higher risk of anaemia in patients with AVP deficiency. The objective was to explore the effect of low AVP levels in patients with central diabetes insipidus (cDI) and primary polydipsia (PP) on haemoglobin and the prevalence of anaemia. METHODS: A total of 164 patients with either cDI (70, 43%) or PP (94, 57%) and 30 healthy volunteers from two prospective diagnostic studies performed in Switzerland, Germany and Brazil were studied. A standardized clinical and biochemical (eg copeptin, full blood count) assessment was performed. Haemoglobin and haematocrit levels and prevalence of anaemia (defined as haemoglobin values of <120 g/L in women and <130 g/L in men) were analysed. RESULTS: Mean copeptin values were 2.63 pmol/L (+/-1.08) and 3.91 pmol/L (+/-4.28) in patients with cDI and PP and 24.76 pmol/L (+/-5.75) in healthy volunteers, P = .02. The prevalence of anaemia was low in all participants with 7.1%, 2.2% and 10% in cDI, PP and in healthy volunteers, P = .15. Mean haemoglobin values were similar in all groups: 139 g/L (+/-15.85), 140 g/L (+/-13.16) and 139 g/L (+/-13.05) in patients with cDI, PP and healthy volunteers, P = .90, as were mean haematocrit values with 41% in all groups (P = .85). CONCLUSION: Chronic low AVP levels in patients with cDI and PP do not affect haemoglobin levels and prevalence of anaemia.",['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Winzeler, Bettina', 'Morin, Benedict', 'Refardt, Julie', 'Imber, Cornelia', 'Fenske, Wiebke', 'Sailer, Clara O', 'Holbro, Andreas', 'Christ-Crain, Mirjam']","['Winzeler B', 'Morin B', 'Refardt J', 'Imber C', 'Fenske W', 'Sailer CO', 'Holbro A', 'Christ-Crain M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8305-2700', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5072-1971', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3040-4685', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6439-8191']","['Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Nephrology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Leipzig University Medical Centre, IFB Adiposity Diseases, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,"['0 (Glycopeptides)', '113-79-1 (Arginine Vasopressin)']",IM,"['*Anemia', 'Arginine Vasopressin', '*Diabetes Insipidus', '*Diabetes Mellitus', 'Female', 'Glycopeptides', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polyuria', 'Prospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AVP', 'antidiuretic hormone', 'erythropoiesis', 'haematopoiesis', 'primary polydipsia']",2020/06/14 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2020/06/14 06:00'],"['2020/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cen.14265 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2020 Oct;93(4):456-465. doi: 10.1111/cen.14265.

Insulin-dependent, non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus and bilateral progressive optic atrophy are both sensitive and specific criteria for clinical diagnosis. The leading cause of death is central respiratory failure resulting from brainstem atrophy. We describe the clinical features of fourteen patients from seven different families followed in our Diabetes Center. The mean age at Wolfram syndrome 1 diagnosis was 12.4 years. Diabetes mellitus was the first clinical manifestation, in all patients. Sensorineural hearing impairment and central diabetes insipidus were present in 85.7% of patients. Other endocrine findings included hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (7.1%), hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (7.1%), and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (21.4%). Neuropsychiatric disorders were detected in 35.7% of patients, and urogenital tract abnormalities were present in 21.4%. Finally, heart diseases were found in 14.2% of patients. Eight patients (57.1%) died at the mean age of 27.3 years. The most common cause of death was respiratory failure which occurred in six patients. The remaining two died due to end-stage renal failure and myocardial infarction.

In the kidney collecting duct, arginine vasopressin-dependent trafficking of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) fine-tunes reabsorption of water from pre-urine, allowing precise regulation of the final urine volume. Point mutations in the gene for AQP2 may disturb this process and lead to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), whereby patients void large volumes of highly hypo-osmotic urine. In recessive NDI, mutants of AQP2 are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum due to misfolding. Here we describe the structural and functional characterization of three AQP2 mutations associated with recessive NDI: T125M and T126M, situated close to a glycosylation site and A147T in the transmembrane region. Using a proteoliposome assay, we show that all three mutants permit the transport of water. The crystal structures of T125M and T126M together with biophysical characterization of all three mutants support that they retain the native structure, but that there is a significant destabilization of A147T. Our work provides unique molecular insights into the mechanisms behind recessive NDI as well as deepens our understanding of how misfolded proteins are recognized by the ER quality control system.",['(c) 2023.

The diagnosis between central/renal origin, or an abnormal thirst regulation (primary polydipsia) is required to organize an adapted management. Because water deprivation tests are not reliable, it's often based on medical history, response to treatment and MRI. Copeptin is an AVP precursor which could be very helpful for the diagnosis. Its basal dosage may identify nephrogenic DI whereas osmotic stimulated dosage would discriminate central DI and primary polydipsia. Central DI is quite frequent after pituitary surgeries or traumatic brain injuries, and often transient. In case of early diagnosis and familial history of DI, a mutation of AVP gene is suspected, most of the time autosomal dominant. MRI is required to identify the other causes, i.e. tumors and inflammatory diseases (sarcoidosis, histiocytosis, hypophysitis). An advanced evaluation is required before idiopathic DI be retained, especially if a thickening of pituitary stalk is observed.

Although postoperative DI often occurs in patients with craniopharyngioma and Rathke's cleft cyst, postoperative DI in patients with non-functioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) has not been fully examined. We clarified the clinical characteristics and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings predicting postoperative DI in NFPAs. METHODS: A total of 333 patients undergoing initial TSS for NFPA were included in this retrospective study. Hyperintensity (HI) in the posterior pituitary lobe was evaluated on preoperative T1-weighted MRI. Based on the findings of HI patients were divided into three groups as follows: HI was not detected (Disappearance group), HI located intrasellarly (Intrasellar group), and HI located suprasellarly (Suprasellar group). RESULTS: The overall rate of DI was 21.9%, including permanent DI in 0.6%. DI occurred at postoperative day 1 (72.6%) or day 2 (19.2%) and improved within 7 days in most cases (87.7%). Univariable and multivariable analyses showed that the predictive factors of DI were a younger age (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-0.99, P = 0.0037) and larger tumor diameter (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08, P = 0.0155). The rate of DI was highest in the Disappearance group (43.8%) followed by the Intrasellar group (26.0%). The OR was 2.17 in the Intrasellar group compared with the Suprasellar group (95% CI 1.17-4.02, P = 0.0141). CONCLUSIONS: Factors predicting DI following TSS for NFPA were a younger age, larger tumor size, and the location of intrasellar HI on preoperative T1-weighted MRI.","['(c) 2021.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is characterized by diluted polyuria and thirstiness, and is clinically categorized into central and nephrogenic DI depending on damaged organs. In most previously reported cases, ANCA-related disorders have been implicated in central DI, which is attributed to impaired secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP) from the posterior pituitary. However, no previous case of AAV-related nephrogenic DI has been reported in the English literature. Herein, we report a case of nephrogenic DI likely caused by AAV. A 76-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for acute kidney injury. He showed dehydration, polyuria, and polydipsia. Laboratory tests demonstrated elevated levels of serum urea and creatinine and a high myeloperoxidase ANCA titer. In the present case, both plasma AVP concentration and response of AVP secretion to 5% saline load test were normal. In addition, 1-desmino-8-arginine vasopressin administration could not increase urinary osmolarity. Kidney biopsy specimen revealed tubulointerstitial nephritis with findings that appeared to indicate peritubular capillaritis. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with nephrogenic DI likely owing to ANCA-associated tubulointerstitial nephritis. Immediately after prednisolone administration, urinary volume decreased, urinary osmolarity increased, and kidney function was improved. This case demonstrates that AAV that extensively affects the tubulointerstitial area can result in nephrogenic DI.",['(c) 2022.

The WFS1 protein is an endoplasmic reticulum(ER) embedded protein, which functions in ER calcium homeostasis and unfolded protein responses. Dysregulation of these cellular processes results in the development of ER stress, leading to apoptosis. In addition, abundantly present WFS1 protein in insulin secretory granules plays a role in the intra-granular acidification.

Usually, the first clinical sign is non-autoimmune diabetes even if other clinical features (optic subatrophy, neurosensorial deafness, diabetes insipidus) may be present in an early state and may be diagnosed after diabetes' onset. Prognosis is poor, and the death occurs at the median age of 39 years as a consequence of progressive respiratory impairment, secondary to brain atrophy and neurological failure. The aim of this paper is the description of the metabolic treatment of the WS. We reported the experience of long treatment in patients with this syndrome diagnosed in pediatric age and followed also in adult age. It is known that there is a correlation between metabolic control of diabetes, the onset of other associated symptoms, and the progression of the neurodegenerative alterations. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary in order to prevent, treat and carefully monitor all the comorbidities that may occur.

This study aimed to identify the cutoff levels of serum copeptin and its optimal timing for predicting the occurrence of central diabetes insipidus in patients who underwent transsphenoidal surgery. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of patients who underwent transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary gland or stalk lesions. Copeptin levels were measured before surgery, 1 h after extubation, and on postoperative days 1, 2, 7, and 90. RESULTS: Among 73 patients, 14 (19.2%) and 13 (17.8%) patients developed transient and permanent central diabetes insipidus, respectively. There was no significant difference in copeptin levels before surgery and 1 h after extubation; copeptin levels on postoperative days 1, 2, 7, and 90 were significantly lower in patients with permanent central diabetes insipidus than in those without central diabetes insipidus. Copeptin measurement on postoperative day 2 exhibited the highest performance for predicting permanent central diabetes insipidus among postoperative days 1, 2, and 7 (area under the curve [95% confidence interval] = 0.754 [0.632-0.876]). Serum copeptin level at postoperative day 2(< 3.1 pmol/L) showed a sensitivity of 92.3% and a negative predictive value of 97.1%. The ratio of copeptin at postoperative day 2 to baseline (< 0.94) presented a sensitivity of 84.6% and a negative predictive value of 94.9%. The copeptin levels > 3.4 and 7.5 pmol/L at postoperative day 2 and 7 may have ruled out the occurrence of CDI with a negative predictive value of 100%. CONCLUSION: The copeptin level at postoperative day 2 and its ratio to baseline can predict the occurrence of permanent central diabetes insipidus after pituitary surgery.","['(c) 2022.

The phenotype of the disease has been associated with several mutations in the WFS1 gene, a nuclear gene localized on chromosome 4. Since the discovery of the association between WFS1 gene and Wolfram syndrome, more than 150 mutations have been identified in WS patients. We previously described the first case of perinatal onset of Wolfram syndrome newborn carrying a segmental uniparental heterodysomy affecting the short arm of chromosome 4 responsible for a significant reduction in wolframin expression. Here we review and discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms that we believe responsible for the perinatal onset of Wolfram syndrome as these data strongly suggest a role for WFS1 gene in foetal and neonatal neurodevelopment. CASE PRESENTATION: We described a male patient of 30 weeks' gestation with intrauterine growth restriction and poly-hydramnios. During the first days of life, the patient showed a 19% weight loss associated with polyuria and hypernatremia. The presence of persistent hypernatremia (serum sodium 150 mEq/L), high plasma osmolarity (322 mOsm/L) and low urine osmolarity (190 mOsm/l) with a Uosm/Posm ratio < 1 were consistent with CDI. The diagnosis of CDI was confirmed by the desmopressin test and the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 34 weeks of age, that showed the lack of posterior pituitary hyperintense signal. In addition, a bilateral asymmetrical optic nerve hypoplasia associated with right orbital bone hypoplasia was observed, suggesting the diagnosis of WF. During the five years follow-up the patient did not developed glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus. By the end of the second year of life, primary non-autoimmune central hypothyroidism and mild neurodevelopment retardation were diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of our case, in the light of the most recent literature, suggests a possible role for WFS1 gene in the development of certain brain structures during the fetal period. Wolfram syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the rare cases of congenital central diabetes insipidus developed in the neonatal period.",,"['Ghirardello, Stefano', 'Dusi, Elisa', 'Castiglione, Bianca', 'Fumagalli, Monica', 'Mosca, Fabio']","['Ghirardello S', 'Dusi E', 'Castiglione B', 'Fumagalli M', 'Mosca F']",,"[""Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. stefano.ghirardello@mangiagalli.it."", ""Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. elisa.dusi@mangiagalli.it."", ""Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. bianca.castiglione@studenti.unimi.it."", ""Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. monica.fumagalli@mangiagalli.it."", ""Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. fabio.mosca@mangiagalli.it.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Ital J Pediatr,Italian journal of pediatrics,101510759,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (wolframin protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/*genetics', 'DNA/*genetics', 'Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Optic Atrophy/congenital/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype', 'Wolfram Syndrome/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC4422421,,,2014/09/27 06:00,2016/01/13 06:00,['2014/09/27 06:00'],"['2014/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['s13052-014-0076-4 [pii]', '76 [pii]', '10.1186/s13052-014-0076-4 [doi]']",epublish,Ital J Pediatr. 2014 Sep 26;40:76. doi: 10.1186/s13052-014-0076-4.,20140926,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to determine whether these abnormalities are present in children, adolescents, and young adults with WFS compared to age- and gender-matched individuals with and without type 1 diabetes using standardized measures. METHODS: Individuals with genetically-confirmed WFS (n = 19, ages 7-27) were compared to age- and gender- equivalent groups of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM; n = 25), and non-diabetic healthy controls (HC: n = 25). Cognitive performance across multiple domains (verbal intelligence, spatial reasoning, memory, attention, smell identification) was assessed using standardized tests. Standardized self- and parent-report questionnaires on psychiatric symptoms and sleep disturbances were acquired from all groups and an unstructured psychiatric interview was performed within only the WFS group. RESULTS: The three groups were similar demographically (age, gender, ethnicity, parental IQ). WFS and T1DM had similar duration of diabetes but T1DM had higher HbA1C levels than WFS and as expected both groups had higher levels than HC. The WFS group was impaired on smell identification and reported sleep quality, but was not impaired in any other cognitive or self-reported psychiatric domain. In fact, the WFS group performed better than the other two groups on selected memory and attention tasks. However, based upon a clinical evaluation of only WFS patients, we found that psychiatric and behavioral problems were present and consisted primarily of anxiety and hypersomnolence. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that cognitive performance and psychological health were relatively preserved WFS patients, while smell and sleep abnormalities manifested in many of the WFS patients. These findings contradict past case and retrospective reports indicating significant cognitive and psychiatric impairment in WFS. While many of these patients were diagnosed with anxiety and hypersomnolence, self-reported measures of psychiatric symptoms indicated that the symptoms were not of grave concern to the patients. It may be that cognitive and psychiatric issues become more prominent later in life and/or in later stages of the disease, but this requires standardized assessment and larger samples to determine. In the relatively early stages of WFS, smell and sleep-related symptoms may be useful biomarkers of disease and should be monitored longitudinally to determine if they are good markers of progression as well.

Rats with DI exhibited bladder hypertrophy, the weight of the bladder in these rats being two times that of controls. Recordings of micturition pattern showed that DI-rats had an increased 24 hour diuresis and micturition volume, and decreased micturition interval in comparison with controls. Cystometry recordings revealed increased bladder capacity and micturition volume in DI-rats. However, in these rats basal bladder pressure and threshold pressure were lower than in controls. No significant changes in micturition pressure or bladder compliance were observed, and none of the rats had residual urine. In organ bath studies, a lower maximal response to electrical field stimulation was obtained in bladder strips from DI-rats, than in the control strips, when expressed relative to the response elicited by K(+)-solution. When activated by field stimulation, the DI-bladder strips and the control strips had similar sensitivity to muscarinic receptor blockade with scopolamine at all stimulation frequencies. The sensitivity to carbachol was similar in the two groups. The results suggest that the increased functional demands of DI on the detrusor do not result in major changes pre- or postjunctionally. Further, several of the previously reported urinary bladder changes observed in rats with diabetes mellitus (DM) are similar to those now reported in rats with DI, emphasizing the importance of an increased diuresis per se for the development of alterations in bladder function. However, in contrast to the findings in DM rats, the sensitivity to electrical stimulation of nerves during blockade of muscarinic receptors was similar in DI-rats and their controls. This supports our previous suggestion that the increased resistance to muscarinic receptor blockade of the bladder in DM-rats at low stimulation frequencies is induced by the disease (diabetes mellitus) as such and not by the increased diuresis.",,"['Malmgren, A', 'Uvelius, B', 'Andersson, K E', 'Andersson, P O']","['Malmgren A', 'Uvelius B', 'Andersson KE', 'Andersson PO']",,"['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,['8Y164V895Y (Carbachol)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Carbachol/pharmacology', 'Diabetes Insipidus/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Diuresis', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Female', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Muscle Contraction/drug effects/physiology', 'Muscle, Smooth/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Brattleboro', 'Urinary Bladder/drug effects/*physiopathology']",,,,1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-5347(17)36780-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-5347(17)36780-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Urol. 1992 Sep;148(3):930-4. doi: 10.1016/s0022-5347(17)36780-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (DM), optic atrophy (OA) diabetes insipidus (DI) and sensorineural deafness (D) are the main features of WFS1-SD. Gonadal dysfunction (GD) has been described mainly in adults with variable prevalence and referred to as a minor clinical feature. This is the first case series investigating gonadal function in a small cohort of paediatric patients affected by WFS1-SD. METHODS: Gonadal function was investigated in eight patients (3 male and 5 female) between 3 and 16 years of age. Seven patients have been diagnosed with classic WFS1-SD and one with non-classic WFS1-SD. Gonadotropin and sex hormone levels were monitored, as well as markers of gonadal reserve (inhibin-B and anti-Mullerian hormone). Pubertal progression was assessed according to Tanner staging. RESULTS: Primary hypogonadism was diagnosed in 50% of patients (n=4), more specifically 67% (n=2) of males and 40% of females (n=2). Pubertal delay was observed in one female patient. These data confirm that gonadal dysfunction may be a frequent and underdiagnosed clinical feature in WFS1-SD. CONCLUSIONS: GD may represent a frequent and earlier than previously described feature in WFS1-SD with repercussions on morbidity and quality of life. Consequently, we suggest that GD should be included amongst clinical diagnostic criteria for WFS1-SD, as has already been proposed for urinary dysfunction. Considering the heterogeneous and elusive presentation of WFS1-SD, this clinical feature may assist in an earlier diagnosis and timely follow-up and care of treatable associated diseases (i.e. insulin and sex hormone replacement) in these young patients.","['Copyright (c) 2023 Frontino, Di Tonno, Stancampiano, Arrigoni, Rigamonti, Morotti,', 'Canarutto, Bonfanti, Russo, Barera and Piemonti.']","['Frontino, Giulio', 'Di Tonno, Raffaella', 'Stancampiano, Marianna Rita', 'Arrigoni, Francesca', 'Rigamonti, Andrea', 'Morotti, Elisa', 'Canarutto, Daniele', 'Bonfanti, Riccardo', 'Russo, Gianni', 'Barera, Graziano', 'Piemonti, Lorenzo']","['Frontino G', 'Di Tonno R', 'Stancampiano MR', 'Arrigoni F', 'Rigamonti A', 'Morotti E', 'Canarutto D', 'Bonfanti R', 'Russo G', 'Barera G', 'Piemonti L']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Diabetes Research Institute, Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Diabetes Research Institute, Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Pediatric Immunohematology Unit and BMT Program, Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Diabetes Research Institute, Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Diabetes Research Institute, Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),Frontiers in endocrinology,101555782,,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Female', 'Male', 'Child', '*Wolfram Syndrome/complications/diagnosis', 'Quality of Life', '*Gonadal Disorders', 'Gonads', '*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1']",PMC10294676,['NOTNLM'],"['Wolfram syndrome', 'Wolfram syndrome 1 (WFS1)', 'gonadal dysfunction', 'hypergonadotropic hypogonadism', 'hypogonadism', 'monogenic diabetes']",2023/06/29 13:42,2023/07/03 06:41,['2023/06/29 11:50'],"['2023/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2023/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/07/03 06:41 [medline]', '2023/06/29 13:42 [pubmed]', '2023/06/29 11:50 [entrez]']",['10.3389/fendo.2023.1155644 [doi]'],epublish,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2023 Jun 13;14:1155644. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2023.1155644. eCollection 2023.,20230613,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinically, SS is characterised by a deficiency in anterior pituitary hormones; involvement of the posterior pituitary is less common. SS presenting as cardiac tamponade is rare, with only a few reported cases in the literature. In this report, we present the case of a patient with SS who arrived at the emergency department with symptoms of light-headedness, palpitations and dyspnoea. Echocardiography revealed a massive pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, and during treatment, the patient experienced ventricular tachycardia and circulatory collapse. The collaboration between various medical specialties, including emergency medicine, cardiology, critical care, endocrinology and radiology, played a crucial role in successful patient management.

The WS gene, WFS1, encodes a transmembrane protein called Wolframin, which recent evidence suggests may serve as a novel endoplasmic reticulum calcium channel in pancreatic beta-cells and neurons. WS is a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence of 1/550.000 children, with a carrier frequency of 1/354. The aim of our study was to determine the genotype of WS patients in order to establish a genotype/phenotype correlation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We clinically evaluated 9 young patients from 9 unrelated families (6 males, 3 females). Basic criteria for WS clinical diagnosis were coexistence of insulin-treated diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy occurring before 15 years of age. Genetic analysis for WFS1 was performed by direct sequencing. Molecular sequencing revealed 5 heterozygous compound and 3 homozygous mutations. All of them were located in exon 8, except one in exon 4. In one proband only an heterozygous mutation (A684V) was found. Two new variants c.2663 C>A and c.1381 A>C were detected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study increases the spectrum of WFS1 mutations with two novel variants. The male patient carrying the compound mutation [c.1060_1062delTTC]+[c.2663 C>A] showed the most severe phenotype: diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy (visual acuity 5/10), deafness with deep auditory bilaterally 8000 Hz, diabetes insipidus associated to reduced volume of posterior pituitary and pons. He died in bed at the age of 13 years. The other patient carrying the compound mutation [c.409_424dup16]+[c.1381 A>C] showed a less severe phenotype (DM, OA).",,"['Aloi, Concetta', 'Salina, Alessandro', 'Pasquali, Lorenzo', 'Lugani, Francesca', 'Perri, Katia', 'Russo, Chiara', 'Tallone, Ramona', 'Ghiggeri, Gian Marco', 'Lorini, Renata', ""d'Annunzio, Giuseppe""]","['Aloi C', 'Salina A', 'Pasquali L', 'Lugani F', 'Perri K', 'Russo C', 'Tallone R', 'Ghiggeri GM', 'Lorini R', ""d'Annunzio G""]",,"['Pediatric Clinic, University of Genoa, IRCCS G.

WFS1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane protein, and Wfs1 knockout (Wfs1-/-) mice, which have been used as a mouse model for WS, reportedly manifested impairment of glucose tolerance due to pancreatic beta-cell loss. In the present study, we examined water balance, arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion, and ER stress in AVP neurons of the hypothalamus in Wfs1-/- mice. There were no differences in urine volumes between Wfs1-/- and wild-type mice with free access to water. Conversely, when mice were subjected to intermittent water deprivation (WD) for 20 weeks, during which water was unavailable for 2 days a week, urine volumes were larger in Wfs1-/- mice, accompanied by lower urine AVP concentrations and urine osmolality, compared to wild-type mice. The mRNA expression of immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein, a marker of ER stress, was significantly increased in the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nuclei in Wfs1-/- mice compared to wild-type mice after WD. Our results thus showed that Wfs1 knockout leads to a decrease in AVP secretion during dehydration, which could explain in part the mechanisms by which Wfs1 mutations cause CDI in humans.","['(c) 2021.

In this study, we aimed to determine the clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with AAV-associated CDI. METHODS: This was a nested case-control study where AAV patients with CDI at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital were followed from January 2012 to April 2022. Case-control matching with AAV patients without CDI was performed (1:5), and participants were matched by age, sex, and AAV classification. We collected clinical data every 3-6 months and conducted a literature review using PubMed to identify relevant articles published from 1983-2022. RESULTS: Among 1203 hospitalized AAV patients, 16 patients with CDI were included (1.3%). The average age was 49 years, and men accounted for 56.3%. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) accounted for 87.5% of patients. AAV patients with CDI had more ear, nose, and throat (ENT) (81.3%) involvement and less renal impairment than those in the control group (P<0.05). After a mean follow-up of four years, 50% of patients were in remission from AAV, 37.5% relapsed, and 12.5% died. Our literature review suggested that patients in Asian countries tend to be older men and have higher myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) positivity than those in Western countries. Furthermore, proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA) positivity may predict disease recurrence. DISCUSSION: AAV patients with CDI had more ENT involvement and a higher eGFR. MPO-ANCA positivity is more commonly observed in Asian countries than Western countries, and PR3-ANCA positivity may predict recurrence.","['Copyright (c) 2023 Chen, Zhang, Peng, Shi, Wu, Wen, Qin, Tian, Zhu and Chen.']","['Chen, Xin', 'Zhang, Shuo', 'Peng, Xia', 'Shi, Xiaoxiao', 'Wu, Haiting', 'Wen, Yubing', 'Qin, Yan', 'Tian, Xinping', 'Zhu, Huijuan', 'Chen, Limeng']","['Chen X', 'Zhang S', 'Peng X', 'Shi X', 'Wu H', 'Wen Y', 'Qin Y', 'Tian X', 'Zhu H', 'Chen L']",,"['Department of Nephrology, State Key Laboratory of Complex Severe and Rare Diseases, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, State Key Laboratory of Complex Severe and Rare Diseases, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, State Key Laboratory of Complex Severe and Rare Diseases, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, State Key Laboratory of Complex Severe and Rare Diseases, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, State Key Laboratory of Complex Severe and Rare Diseases, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, State Key Laboratory of Complex Severe and Rare Diseases, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, State Key Laboratory of Complex Severe and Rare Diseases, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, State Key Laboratory of Complex Severe and Rare Diseases, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),Frontiers in endocrinology,101555782,"['0 (Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['Male', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Middle Aged', 'Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic', '*Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis/complications', 'Myeloblastin', '*Diabetes Mellitus']",PMC10213315,['NOTNLM'],"['MPO-ANCA', 'PR3-ANCA', 'antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis', 'diabetes insipidus', 'recurrence rate']",2023/05/30 13:07,2023/06/01 06:42,['2023/05/30 11:42'],"['2023/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2023/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/06/01 06:42 [medline]', '2023/05/30 13:07 [pubmed]', '2023/05/30 11:42 [entrez]']",['10.3389/fendo.2023.1173903 [doi]'],epublish,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2023 May 12;14:1173903. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2023.1173903. eCollection 2023.,20230512,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

At 2 months after birth, he was diagnosed as having inherited distal renal tubular acidosis and thereafter supplementation of both potassium and alkali was started to treat his hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. At the age of 4 years, calcification of the bilateral renal medulla was detected by computed tomography. Subsequently his urinary volume gradually increased and polyuria of approximately 4 L/day persisted. At the age of 27 years, he became fond of sugar-sweetened drinks and also often forgot to take the medicine. He was admitted to our hospital due to polyuria of more than 10 L day, muscle weakness and gait disturbance. Laboratory tests disclosed worsening of both hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis in addition to severe hyperglycemia. It seemed likely that occurrence of diabetes mellitus and cessation of medications can induce osmotic diuresis and aggravate hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. Consequently, severe dehydration, hypokalemia-induced damage of his urinary concentration ability and enhancement of the renin angiotensin system occurred and thereby possibly worsened his hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. As normalization of hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis might have exacerbated hypokalemia further, dehydration and hypokalemia were treated first. Following intensive treatment, these abnormalities were improved, but polyuria persisted. Elevated plasma antidiuretic hormone (12.0 pg/mL) and deficit of renal responses to antidiuretic hormone suggested that the polyuria was attributable to the preexisting renal diabetes insipidus possibly caused by bilateral renal medulla calcification. Thiazide diuretic or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were not effective for the treatment of diabetes insipidus in the present case.",,"['Liu, Hexing', 'Tomoda, Fumihiro', 'Koike, Tsutomu', 'Ohara, Maiko', 'Nakagawa, Taizo', 'Kagitani, Satoshi', 'Inoue, Hiroshi']","['Liu H', 'Tomoda F', 'Koike T', 'Ohara M', 'Nakagawa T', 'Kagitani S', 'Inoue H']",,"['Second Department of Internal Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.']",['jpn'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Jinzo Gakkai Shi,Nihon Jinzo Gakkai shi,7505731,,IM,"['Acidosis/etiology', 'Acidosis, Renal Tubular/*complications', 'Adult', 'Diabetes Complications/*complications', 'Diabetes Insipidus, Nephrogenic/*etiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Hypokalemia/etiology', 'Kidney Calculi/etiology', 'Male', 'Polyuria/etiology']",,,,2011/08/17 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/08/17 06:00'],"['2011/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nihon Jinzo Gakkai Shi. 2011;53(5):726-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contractions elicited at 1 Hz by control and impaired bladders were potentiated equally by tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) (5 mM) or by carbachol (2 X 10(-7) M). Contractions elicited at 20 Hz by normal bladders were not potentiated, those by impaired bladders were. TEA, by increasing transmitter release, and carbachol, by a postjunctional action, substantially reversed bladder dysfunction. Because control and impaired bladders were equally enhanced by TEA, prejunctional and contractile element (CE) activity at 1 Hz were probably unaffected by distension. However, postjunctional sensitivity was probably reduced. Impaired bladders, more compliant than controls, became less compliant after carbachol without elevating resting pressure.

Patients with this condition are at high risk of additional oxytocin deficiency owing to the close anatomical proximity of oxytocin-producing neurons; however, no conclusive evidence for such a deficiency has been reported. We aimed to use 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, also known as ecstasy), a strong activator of the central oxytocinergic system, as a biochemical and psychoactive provocation test to investigate oxytocin deficiency in patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus). METHODS: This single-centre, case-control study with nested, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial included patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) and healthy controls (matched 1:1 by age, sex, and BMI) and was conducted at the University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. We used block randomisation to assign participants to receive either a single oral dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo in the first experimental session; patients received the opposite treatment at the next session, with a wash-out period of at least 2 weeks between the two sessions. Participants and investigators assessing the outcomes were masked to assignment. Oxytocin concentrations were measured at 0, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 300 min after MDMA or placebo. The primary outcome was the area under the plasma oxytocin concentration curve (AUC) after drug intake. The AUC was compared between groups and conditions using a linear mixed-effects model. Subjective drug effects were assessed throughout the study using ten-point visual analogue scales. Acute adverse effects were assessed before and 360 min after drug intake using a 66-item list of complaints. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04648137. FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, 2021, and May 1, 2022, we recruited 15 patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) and 15 healthy controls. All participants completed the study and were included in the analyses. In healthy controls, median plasma oxytocin concentration was 77 pg/mL (IQR 59-94) at baseline and increased by 659 pg/mL (355-914) in response to MDMA, resulting in an AUC of 102 095 pg/mL (41 782-129 565); in patients, baseline oxytocin concentration was 60 pg/mL (51-74) and only slightly increased by 66 pg/mL (16-94) in response to MDMA, resulting in an AUC of 6446 pg/mL (1291-11 577). The effect of MDMA on oxytocin was significantly different between groups: the AUC for oxytocin was 82% (95% CI 70-186) higher in healthy controls than in patients (difference 85 678 pg/mL [95% CI 63 356-108 000], p<0.0001). The increase in oxytocin in healthy controls was associated with typical strong subjective prosocial, empathic, and anxiolytic effects, whereas only minimal subjective effects were observed in patients, in agreement with the lack of increase in oxytocin concentrations. The most frequently reported adverse effects were fatigue (eight [53%] healthy controls and eight [53%] patients), lack of appetite (ten [67%] healthy controls and eight [53%] patients), lack of concentration (eight [53%] healthy controls and seven [47%] patients), and dry mouth (eight [53%] healthy controls and eight [53%] patients). In addition, two (13%) healthy controls and four (27%) patients developed transient mild hypokalaemia. INTERPRETATION: These findings are highly suggestive of clinically meaningful oxytocin deficiency in patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus), laying the groundwork for a new hypothalamic-pituitary disease entity.

Neurologic symptoms of affected patients include ataxia, sleep apnea, loss of bladder control, dysphagia, loss of taste, and accompanying psychiatric symptoms as a sign of progressive neurodegeneration. Its genetic cause is mainly biallelic mutations of the Wolframin endoplasmatic reticulum transmembrane glycoprotein gene Wfs1. These result in increased ER stress, which in turn induces apoptosis and leads to the depletion of the corresponding cells and a loss of their physiological functions. Though diabetes mellitus is mostly treated by insulin, there is still no proven cure for the disease in general. It leads to premature death in affected individuals-usually within the 4th decade of live. CURRENT RESEARCH AND TREATMENT TRIALS: Clinical studies are currently being conducted at various locations worldwide to test a therapy for the disease using various approaches. POTENTAIL OF VIRTUAL NETOWRKING: As rare diseases in general represent a major challenge for individual clinicians and researchers due to the rarity of diagnosis, the lack of evidence and of value of existing research, international cooperation, coordination and networking leading to an alignment of different stakeholders is necessary to support patients and increase knowledge about these diseases, like wolfram syndrome.

WS is variably associated with diabetes insipidus, neurological disorders, urinary tract anomalies, endocrine dysfunctions and many other systemic manifestations. Since Wolfram and Wagener first described WS in 1938, new phenotypic/genotypic variants of the syndrome have been observed and the clinical picture has been significantly enriched. To date, two main subtypes of WS that associated with two different mutations are known: WS type 1 (WS1), caused by the mutation of the wolframine gene (WS1; 606201), and WS type 2 (WS2), caused by the mutation of the CISD2 gene (WS2; 604928). METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was describe the phenotypic characteristics of WS2 in order to highlight the key elements that differentiate it from the classic form. CONCLUSION: WS2 is the rarest and most recently identified subtype of WS; its clinical picture is partially overlapping with that of WS1, from which it traditionally differs by the absence of diabetes insipidus and the presence of greater bleeding tendency and peptic ulcers.",,"['Rosanio, Francesco Maria', 'Di Candia, Francesca', 'Occhiati, Luisa', 'Fedi, Ludovica', 'Malvone, Francesco Paolo', 'Foschini, Davide Fortunato', 'Franzese, Adriana', 'Mozzillo, Enza']","['Rosanio FM', 'Di Candia F', 'Occhiati L', 'Fedi L', 'Malvone FP', 'Foschini DF', 'Franzese A', 'Mozzillo E']",,"['Regional Center of Pediatric Diabetes, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Section of Pediatrics, Federico II University, Via Sergio Pansini 5, 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'Regional Center of Pediatric Diabetes, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Section of Pediatrics, Federico II University, Via Sergio Pansini 5, 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'Regional Center of Pediatric Diabetes, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Section of Pediatrics, Federico II University, Via Sergio Pansini 5, 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'Regional Center of Pediatric Diabetes, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Section of Pediatrics, Federico II University, Via Sergio Pansini 5, 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'Regional Center of Pediatric Diabetes, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Section of Pediatrics, Federico II University, Via Sergio Pansini 5, 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'Regional Center of Pediatric Diabetes, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Section of Pediatrics, Federico II University, Via Sergio Pansini 5, 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'Regional Center of Pediatric Diabetes, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Section of Pediatrics, Federico II University, Via Sergio Pansini 5, 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'Regional Center of Pediatric Diabetes, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Section of Pediatrics, Federico II University, Via Sergio Pansini 5, 80131 Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,['0 (Membrane Proteins)'],IM,"['*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', '*Mitochondrial Diseases/complications/genetics', 'Mutation', '*Optic Atrophy/complications/diagnosis/genetics', '*Wolfram Syndrome/diagnosis/genetics']",PMC8776149,['NOTNLM'],"['CISD2', 'DIDMOAD', 'Wolfram syndrome type 2', 'bleeding disorders', 'gastrointestinal ulcers', 'genetic diabetes', 'hearing loss', 'optic atrophy']",2022/01/22 06:00,2022/03/01 06:00,['2022/01/21 01:12'],"['2021/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2022/01/10 00:00 [revised]', '2022/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/21 01:12 [entrez]', '2022/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph19020835 [pii]', 'ijerph-19-00835 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph19020835 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2022 Jan 12;19(2):835. doi: 10.3390/ijerph19020835.,20220112,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A neurodegenerative syndrome is usually associated, including cerebellar ataxia. A few cases of central apnea have been reported in the literature. Here, we report a case of Wolfram syndrome with respiratory symptoms that led to the discovery of central apneas as well as complicated and delayed weaning in an intensive care unit (ICU). OBSERVATION: The patient is a 39-year-old woman diagnosed with Wolfram syndrome who was admitted to an ICU for septic shock. She experienced difficult weaning before central apneas were observed while spontaneous ventilation was being attempted. After two extubation failures, cerebral MRI was performed and revealed parenchymatous atrophy of the posterior brain fossa involving the cerebral trunk, cerebellar peduncles, as well as both cerebellum hemispheres and the cerebellar vermis. Even after the patient was tracheotomized, central apneas persisted when the patient breathed spontaneously with her tracheotomy, necessitating nocturnal ventilation. CONCLUSION: While central apneas Wolfram syndrome remain rare, they should be systematically investigated due to their association with severe morbimortality.",['Copyright (c) 2021 SPLF.

AVPR2 is a kind of G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and mainly couples with Galphas protein leading to cAMP accumulation in the cell as a secondary messenger. Recent studies showed that some AVPR2 mutations could cause biased Galphaq/11 protein coupling rather than Galphas. Investigation into the characterization of biased receptors may give insights into the relationship between the conformational change of the receptor because of the mutation and related downstream signaling. In this study, R68W and V162A were analyzed to whether they show a bias to Galphas or Galphaq/11 proteins. Their functionality in terms of cAMP production via Galphas protein coupling was decreased compared to the wild-type receptor. On the other hand, they showed the ability to couple with Galphaq/11 protein and make Ca(2+) mobilization at different levels in the cell. R68W showed bias to coupling with Galphaq/11 protein rather than V162A and wild-type receptor. Studies about the Galpha protein coupling bias of mutant AVPR2s may broaden our understanding of the relationship between the changed conformation of the receptor and consequently activated signaling pathways, and also may shed light on the development of more effective new therapeutics.",,"['Erdem Tuncdemir, Beril']",['Erdem Tuncdemir B'],,"['Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Hacettepe University, Beytepe, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Recept Signal Transduct Res,Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,9509432,"['EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11)', '0 (Receptors, Vasopressin)', '0 (AVPR2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Humans', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Nephrogenic/genetics/metabolism', '*Diabetes Mellitus', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', '*Receptors, Vasopressin/genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AVPR2', 'GPCR', 'Galpha protein', 'NDI', 'biased receptor']",2022/07/29 06:00,2022/12/15 06:00,['2022/07/28 13:43'],"['2022/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2022/07/28 13:43 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10799893.2022.2102651 [doi]'],ppublish,J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2022 Dec;42(6):573-579. doi: 10.1080/10799893.2022.2102651.

COVID-19 vaccines potential adverse effects may mimetize some of these complications. CASE REPORT: Woman 37 years old, with rheumatoid arthritis under adalimumab (40 mg twice a month) since December 2018. She was in her usual state of health when she has received the second dose of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (June 2021). Seven days later, she started reporting intense thirst and polyuria and consulted her family physician. BLOOD ANALYSIS: creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, glucose 95mg/dL, Na+ 141mEq/L, K+ 3.9 mEq/L, TSH 3.8 mcUI/L (0.38-5.33), FT4 0.9 ng/dL (0.6-1.1), cortisol 215.4 nmol/L (185-624), ACTH 21.9 pg/mL (6- 48), FSH 4.76 UI/L, LH5.62 UI/L, estradiol 323 pmol/L, IGF1 74.8 ng/mL (88-209), PRL 24.7mcg/L (3.3-26.7) osmolality 298.2 mOs/Kg (250- 325); Urine analysis: volume 10200 mL/24h, osmolality 75 mOs/Kg (300-900), density 1.002. On water restriction test: 0' - Serum osmolality 308.8mOsm/Kg vs. urine osmolality 61.0 mOsm/Kg; 60' - urine osmolality 102 mOsm/Kg; urine osmolality 1 h after desmopressine was 511mOsm/kg. MRI revealed no abnormal signs consistent with hypophysitis except for the loss of the posterior pituitary bright spot on T1 weighted imaging. Diagnosis of CDI was assumed, and started therapy with desmopressine. A report of potential adverse effect was addressed to national health authorities.

Inherited forms are caused by X-linked loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R) or autosomal recessive/dominant mutations in the gene encoding aquaporin 2 (AQP2). A common acquired form is lithium-induced NDI. AVP facilitates reabsorption of water through increased abundance and insertion of AQP2 in the apical membrane of principal cells in the collecting ducts. In X-linked NDI, V2R is dysfunctional, which leads to impaired water reabsorption. These patients have functional AQP2, and thus the challenge is to achieve AQP2 membrane insertion independently of V2R. The current treatment is symptomatic and is based on distally acting diuretics (thiazide or amiloride) and cyclooxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin). This mini-review covers published data from trials in preclinical in vivo models and a few human intervention studies to improve NDI by more causal approaches. Promising effects on NDI in preclinical studies have been demonstrated by the use of pharmacological approaches with secretin, Wnt5a, protein kinase A agonist, fluconazole, prostaglandin E(2) EP2 and EP4 agonists, statins, metformin, and soluble prorenin receptor agonists. In patients, only casuistic reports have evaluated the effect of statins, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (rolipram and sildenafil), and the guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat without amelioration of symptoms. It is concluded that there is currently no established intervention that causally improves symptoms or quality of life in patients with NDI.

Incomplete characterisation of this autosomal recessive syndrome has relied on case-reports, and there is confusion with mitochondrial genome disorders.

We identified 45 patients with Wolfram syndrome--a prevalence of one per 770,000. Non-autoimmune, insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus presented at a median age of 6 years, followed by optic atrophy (11 years). Cranial diabetes insipidus occurred in 33 patients (73%) with sensorineural deafness (28, 62%) in the second decade; renal-tract abnormalities (26, 58%) presented in the third decade followed by neurological complications (cerebellar ataxia, myoclonus [28, 62%]) in the fourth decade. Other abnormalities included gastrointestinal dysmotility in 11 (24%), and primary gonadal atrophy in seven of ten males investigated. Median age at death (commonly central respiratory failure with brain-stem atrophy) was 30 years (range 25-49). The natural history of Wolfram syndrome suggests that most patients will eventually develop most complications of this progressive, neurodegenerative disorder.

Four entities have to be differentiated: central diabetes insipidus resulting from a deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus resulting from resistance to AVP in the kidneys, gestational diabetes insipidus resulting from an increase in placental vasopressinase and finally primary polydipsia, which involves excessive intake of large amounts of water despite normal AVP secretion and action. Distinguishing between the different types of diabetes insipidus can be challenging. A detailed medical history, physical examination and imaging studies are needed to detect the aetiology of diabetes insipidus. Differentiation between the various forms of hypotonic polyuria is then done by the classical water deprivation test or the more recently developed hypertonic saline or arginine stimulation together with copeptin (or AVP) measurement. In patients with idiopathic central DI, a close follow-up is needed since central DI can be the first sign of an underlying pathology. Treatment of diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia depends on the underlying aetiology and differs in central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia.

The aim of the study was to describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of families with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. METHODS: Five Portuguese families with autosomal dominant FNDI underwent sequencing of the AVP gene and the identified mutations were functionally characterized by in vitro studies. RESULTS: Three novel and two recurrent heterozygous mutations were identified in the AVP gene. These consisted of one initiation codon mutation in the signal peptide coding region (c.2T > C, p.Met1?), three missense mutations in the neurophysin II (NPII) coding region (c.154T > C, p.Cys52Arg; c.289C > G, p.Arg97Gly; and c.293G > C, p.Cys98Ser), and one nonsense mutation in the NPII coding region (c.343G > T, p.Glu115Ter). In vitro transfection of neuronal cells with expression vectors containing each mutation showed that the mutations resulted in intracellular retention of the vasopressin prohormone. Patients showed progressive symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia, but with wide variability in severity and age at onset. No clear genotype-phenotype correlation was observed. CONCLUSION: The intracellular accumulation of mutant vasopressin precursors supports the role of cellular toxicity of the mutant proteins in the etiology of the disorder and explains the progressive onset of the disorder. These findings further expand the AVP mutational spectrum in FNDI and contribute to the understanding of the molecular pathogenic mechanisms involved in FNDI.",,"['Alvelos, Maria Ines', 'Francisco, Angela', 'Gomes, Leonor', 'Paiva, Isabel', 'Melo, Miguel', 'Marques, Pedro', 'Gama-de-Sousa, Susana', 'Carreiro, Sofia', 'Quintela, Telma', 'Goncalves, Isabel', 'Lemos, Manuel Carlos']","['Alvelos MI', 'Francisco A', 'Gomes L', 'Paiva I', 'Melo M', 'Marques P', 'Gama-de-Sousa S', 'Carreiro S', 'Quintela T', 'Goncalves I', 'Lemos MC']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9326-8900'],"['CICS-UBI, Health Sciences Research Centre, University of Beira Interior, 6200-506, Covilha, Portugal.', 'ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Medical Faculty, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'CICS-UBI, Health Sciences Research Centre, University of Beira Interior, 6200-506, Covilha, Portugal.', 'Servico de Endocrinologia, Diabetes e Metabolismo, Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Coimbra, 3000-075, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Servico de Endocrinologia, Diabetes e Metabolismo, Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Coimbra, 3000-075, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Servico de Endocrinologia, Diabetes e Metabolismo, Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Coimbra, 3000-075, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Servico de Endocrinologia, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia de Lisboa, 1099-023, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Servico de Pediatria, Centro Hospitalar do Medio Ave, Unidade de V.

Our present study addresses the role of vasopressin (AVP) in maintaining adrenocortical responsiveness during DM. AVP-deficient mutant Brattleboro rats were used with heterozygous controls and the V2 agonist, desmopressin was infused to replace peripheral AVP. To induce DM the rats were injected by streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/ml/kg i.v.) and studied 2 weeks later. The acute stress stimulus was 60 min restraint. The signs of DM (the increase in water consumption and in blood glucose levels) were discovered in all rats. The diuretic effect of the lack of AVP was additional to the DM-induced osmotic diuresis. DM induced significant, chronic stress-like somatic changes on which AVP-deficiency had no effect and although desmopressin infusion normalized the water consumption and the body weight gain in AVP-deficient rats, it had no effect on DM-induced changes. The acute stress-induced plasma ACTH elevation was smaller in AVP-deficient or DM rats but these effects were not additive. Desmopressin did not normalize the decreased ACTH-elevation of AVP-deficient animals. The resting morning plasma corticosterone level was elevated both in DM and AVP-deficient rats without interaction. The restraint-induced corticosterone rise was influenced neither by the lack of AVP nor by DM and the basal and stress-induced prolactin levels were smaller in DM rats without any effect of AVP-deficiency. In conclusion, our data suggest that AVP does not play a crucial role in HPA axis regulation during DM-induced chronic stress. In contrast, the role of AVP seems to be more important during acute stress, however, it is restricted to the ACTH regulation. According to the water consumption data diabetes insipidus seems to be an additional risk factor for DM.",,"['Zelena, Dora', 'Mergl, Zsuzsa', 'Makara, Gabor B']","['Zelena D', 'Mergl Z', 'Makara GB']",,"['Institute of Experimental Medicine, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, 1083 Budapest, Szigony 43, Hungary. zelena@koki.hu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Brain Res Bull,Brain research bulletin,7605818,"['11000-17-2 (Vasopressins)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood', 'Animals', 'Corticosterone/blood', 'Diabetes Insipidus/genetics/physiopathology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/*physiopathology', 'Prolactin/blood', 'Rats', 'Rats, Brattleboro', 'Stress, Psychological/blood/physiopathology', 'Vasopressins/*metabolism']",,,,2006/02/09 09:00,2007/11/01 09:00,['2006/02/09 09:00'],"['2005/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0361-9230(05)00449-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.brainresbull.2005.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res Bull. 2006 Mar 15;69(1):48-56. doi: 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2005.10.009.

The aim of the study was to examine the clinical profile of patients with DIDMOAD syndrome presenting to a tertiary care hospital in north India. METHODS: Clinical presentation of juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus fulfilling the diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome was studied using a prepared standardized form. RESULTS: Subjects with juvenile-onset non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus attending the diabetic clinic at a tertiary care centre in north India were followed for 10 years and a diagnosis of fully developed Wolfram syndrome was confirmed in seven individuals. The series consisted of five male and two female patients with a mean age of 17.5 +/-7.34 years. Two subjects had consanguinity and none had any other family member affected. Optic atrophy was present in all, sensorineural hearing loss in 4/7, central diabetes insipidus in 4/7 and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in 2/7 subjects. The new associations found were: spastic myoclonus, short stature with pancreatic malabsorption, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, cyanotic heart disease and choledocholithiasis with cholangitis. Genetic analysis revealed mutation in exon 8 of the WFS1 gene in all the cases studied.

In the late 19th century, clinicians identified the posterior pituitary as the site of pathology, and pharmacologists found multiple bioactivities there. Early in the 20th century, the amelioration of the polyuria with extracts of the posterior pituitary inaugurated a new era in therapy and advanced the hypothesis that DI was due to a hormone deficiency. Decades later, a subset of patients with polyuria unresponsive to therapy were recognized, leading to the distinction between central DI and nephrogenic DI, an early example of a hormone-resistant condition. Recognition that the posterior pituitary had 2 hormones was followed by du Vigneaud's Nobel Prize winning isolation, sequencing, and chemical synthesis of oxytocin and vasopressin. The pure hormones accelerated the development of bioassays and immunoassays that confirmed the hormone deficiency in vasopressin-sensitive DI and abundant levels of hormone in patients with the nephrogenic disorder. With both forms of the disease, acquired and inborn defects were recognized. Emerging concepts of receptors and of genetic analysis led to the recognition of patients with mutations in the genes for 1) arginine vasopressin (AVP), 2) the AVP receptor 2 (AVPR2), and 3) the aquaporin 2 water channel (AQP2).

To date more than 30 mutations, insertions or deletions have been reported in independent families, without any significant differences in the phenotypic expression of the disease. The AVPR2 is a member of the superfamily of 7 transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled receptor, linked to cyclic AMP second messenger system.

Cranial diabetes insipidus was diagnosed by plasma AVP responses to osmotic stimulation during infusion of hypertonic 5% saline which were subnormal in 13 patients, 4 of whom had undetectable plasma AVP and 3 who had reduced but osmoregulated AVP release. Standard water deprivation tests confirmed cranial diabetes insipidus in all but 2 patients who were diagnosed as partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The remaining 8 patients had normal, osmoregulated AVP secretion; the cause of their polyuria was determined by their renal response to desmopressin. Two patients had nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and 6 had primary polydipsia. The majority of polyuric patients could be accurately diagnosed by carefully performed dehydration tests.

Among these, central diabetes insipidus (CDI), characterized by polyuria, polydipsia, low urine specific gravity, and deficiency of arginine vasopressin contents, is a typical complication after hypothalamic injury. METHODS: CDI was induced by hypothalamic pituitary stalk injury in male animals. Behavioral parameters and blood sample were collected to evaluate the characteristics of body fluid metabolism imbalance. The brains were harvested for high-throughput RNA sequencing and immunostaining to identify pathophysiological changes in corresponding hypothalamic nuclei. RESULTS: Based on transcriptomic analysis, we demonstrated the upregulation of the activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3)/c-Jun axis and identified Lgals3, a microglial activation-related gene, as the most significant target gene in response to the body fluid imbalance in CDI. Furthermore, we found that the microglia possessed elevated phagocytic ability, which could promote the elimination of arginine vasopressin neurons after hypothalamic injury. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that the Atf3/c-Jun/Lgals3 axis was associated with the microglial activation, and might participate in the loss of functional arginine vasopressin neurons in CDI after hypothalamic injury.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

Central diabetes insipidus, secondary to lack of vasopressin production, is more common in children than is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the inability to respond appropriately to vasopressin. The goal of treatment in both forms of diabetes insipidus is to decrease urine output and thirst while allowing for appropriate fluid balance, normonatremia and ensuring an acceptable quality of life for each patient. An infant's obligate need to consume calories as liquid and the need for readjustment of medication dosing in growing children both present unique challenges for diabetes insipidus management in the pediatric population. Treatment modalities typically include vasopressin or thiazide diuretics.

In the absence of production by posterior pituitary, central diabetes insipidus (DI) occurs with hypernatremia. There are hereditary autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X- linked forms. When ADH is secreted but there is an alteration on his receptor AVPR2, it is a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in acquired or hereditary form. We can make difference on AVP levels and/or on desmopressine response which is negative in nephrogenic forms. Hyponatremia occurs when there is an excess of ADH production: it is a euvolemic hypoosmolar hyponatremia. The most frequent etiology is SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH), a diagnostic of exclusion which is made after eliminating corticotropin deficiency and hypothyroidism. In case of brain injury the differential diagnosis of cerebral salt wasting (CSW) syndrome has to be discussed, because its treatment is perfusion of isotonic saline whereas in SIADH, the treatment consists in administration of hypertonic saline if hyponatremia is acute and/or severe. If not, fluid restriction demeclocycline or vaptans (antagonists of V2 receptors) can be used in some European countries. Four types of SIADH exist; 10 % of cases represent not SIADH but SIAD (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis) due to a constitutive activation of vasopressin receptor that produces water excess. c 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

They are: (1) pituitary DI, due to inadequate production and secretion of antidiuretic hormone, arginine-vasopressin (AVP); (2) gestational DI due to degradation of AVP by an enzyme made in placenta; (3) primary polydipsia, due to suppression of AVP secretion by excessive fluid intake; and (4) nephrogenic DI due to renal insensitivity to the antidiuretic effect of AVP. This review describes several methods of differential diagnosis, indicates the advantages and disadvantages of each and presents a new approach that is simpler and less costly but just as reliable as the best of the older methods.

Delayed diagnosis and inadequate management of such cases may lead to worsened neurological outcomes with a high mortality rate. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report the case of a 7-year-old girl who underwent surgical resection of a craniopharyngioma, following which she initially developed central diabetes insipidus. However, later on in the course of her illness she developed symptomatic hyponatremia with natriuresis which was diagnosed to be due to cerebral salt wasting disease. This combination of central diabetes insipidus and cerebral salt wasting syndrome is a rare occurrence and poses a diagnostic challenge. Diagnosis and management can be even more difficult when these conditions precede or coexist with each other. CONCLUSION: In such cases development of hyponatremia should always prompt consideration of unusual causes like cerebral salt wasting disease in addition to the classically described syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone. Hence, a thorough knowledge of these disorders along with intensive monitoring of fluid and sodium status is critical for timely diagnosis and management of these patients.",['(c) 2021.

METHODS: This review examines the normal physiology of water homeostasis, the related changes that occur during pregnancy, and the pathophysiology of diabetes insipidus in pregnancy. Associated complications, evaluation, and management are discussed. RESULTS: Diabetes insipidus can complicate up to 1 in 30,000 pregnancies. Diabetes insipidus during pregnancy has a variety of causes, some that predate the pregnancy and others that begin during gestation. Polyuria and polydipsia can occur or be exacerbated in women with overt or subclinical central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. These women have either decreased central secretory reserve or impaired renal responsiveness to vasopressin. In addition, women can experience diabetes insipidus de novo in pregnancy through the actions of placental vasopressinase, which causes accelerated degradation of vasopressin. This form of diabetes insipidus may be associated with increased complications of pregnancy, including preeclampsia. Management of central diabetes insipidus and transient diabetes insipidus of pregnancy can be achieved with 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (desmopressin acetate) (DDAVP), a vasopressin analogue. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is typically resistant to both DDAVP and vasopressin and underlying causes should be addressed. CONCLUSIONS: Increased awareness of diabetes insipidus in pregnancy may lead to early diagnosis and appropriate treatment that will reduce the risks of maternal and fetal morbidity. Overall, growing experience with DDAVP has shown that it is a safe and effective treatment for diabetes insipidus caused by a variety of factors.",,"['Ananthakrishnan, Sonia']",['Ananthakrishnan S'],,"['Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Nutrition, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02118, USA.

Most affected individuals carry recessive mutations in the Wolfram syndrome 1 gene (WFS1). However, the phenotypic pleiomorphism, rarity and molecular complexity of this disease complicate our efforts to understand WFS. To address this limitation, we aimed to describe complications and to elucidate the contributions of WFS1 mutations to clinical manifestations in Japanese patients with WFS. METHODOLOGY: The minimal ascertainment criterion for diagnosing WFS was having both early onset diabetes mellitus and bilateral optic atrophy. Genetic analysis for WFS1 was performed by direct sequencing. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sixty-seven patients were identified nationally for a prevalence of one per 710,000, with 33 patients (49%) having all 4 components of DIDMOAD. In 40 subjects who agreed to participate in this investigation from 30 unrelated families, the earliest manifestation was DM at a median age of 8.7 years, followed by OA at a median age of 15.8 years. However, either OA or DI was the first diagnosed feature in 6 subjects. In 10, features other than DM predated OA. Twenty-seven patients (67.5%) had a broad spectrum of recessive mutations in WFS1. Two patients had mutations in only one allele. Eleven patients (27.5%) had intact WFS1 alleles. Ages at onset of both DM and OA in patients with recessive WFS1 mutations were indistinguishable from those in patients without WFS1 mutations. In the patients with predicted complete loss-of-function mutations, ages at the onsets of both DM and OA were significantly earlier than those in patients with predicted partial-loss-of function mutations. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study emphasizes the clinical and genetic heterogeneity in patients with WFS. Genotype-phenotype correlations may exist in patients with WFS1 mutations, as demonstrated by the disease onset.",,"['Matsunaga, Kimie', 'Tanabe, Katsuya', 'Inoue, Hiroshi', 'Okuya, Shigeru', 'Ohta, Yasuharu', 'Akiyama, Masaru', 'Taguchi, Akihiko', 'Kora, Yukari', 'Okayama, Naoko', 'Yamada, Yuichiro', 'Wada, Yasuhiko', 'Amemiya, Shin', 'Sugihara, Shigetaka', 'Nakao, Yuzo', 'Oka, Yoshitomo', 'Tanizawa, Yukio']","['Matsunaga K', 'Tanabe K', 'Inoue H', 'Okuya S', 'Ohta Y', 'Akiyama M', 'Taguchi A', 'Kora Y', 'Okayama N', 'Yamada Y', 'Wada Y', 'Amemiya S', 'Sugihara S', 'Nakao Y', 'Oka Y', 'Tanizawa Y']",,"['Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, Hematological Science and Therapeutics, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, Hematological Science and Therapeutics, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, Hematological Science and Therapeutics, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, Hematological Science and Therapeutics, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, Hematological Science and Therapeutics, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, Hematological Science and Therapeutics, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, Hematological Science and Therapeutics, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, Hematological Science and Therapeutics, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Division of Laboratory Yamaguchi University Hospital, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes, Geriatric Medicine, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Health and Nutrition, Kochi University, Kochi, Kochi Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Saitama Medical University, Moroyama, Saitama, Japan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Tokyo Women's Medical University Medical Center East, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Division of Ophthalmology, Kinki University Sakai Hospital, Sakai, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Metabolism and Diabetes, Tohoku University Graduate School of medicine, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, Hematological Science and Therapeutics, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (wolframin protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Child', 'Diabetes Complications/genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mutation', '*Neuroimaging', 'Optic Atrophy/genetics/pathology', 'Pedigree', 'Wolfram Syndrome/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology']",PMC4161373,,,2014/09/12 06:00,2015/05/26 06:00,['2014/09/12 06:00'],"['2014/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-14-13530 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0106906 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Sep 11;9(9):e106906. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0106906. eCollection 2014.,20140911,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with ADI experience marked morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis and management of these patients is quite challenging, even in expert hands. In this review, we aim to provide an updated overview of this difficult clinical scenario. METHODS: We conducted a PubMed search for articles related to ADI. The search terms ""adipsia,"" ""adipsic,"" ""thirst,"" and ""diabetes insipidus"" were used to identify relevant literature. RESULTS: ADI has been described in only approximately 100 patients. This rarity has limited the quality and quantity of literature to case reports, case series, and expert opinion. Diagnosis focuses on confirmation of CDI followed by documenting subnormal or completely absent thirst in response to a hypertonic stimulus. Among the described patients with ADI, the majority experience morbidity (e.g., severe hypernatremia, sleep apnea, venous thromboembolism [VTE], and obesity) and an increased mortality risk. Management focuses on frequent reassessment of daily prescribed water intake with fixed antidiuretic therapy (desmopressin) and comorbidity screening. CONCLUSION: The complexity of patients with ADI provides a difficult challenge for clinicians. Prompt recognition of thirst disorders in patients with CDI should lead to appropriately regimented management strategies and can result in safe outpatient care for these unique patients.",,"['Eisenberg, Yuval', 'Frohman, Lawrence A']","['Eisenberg Y', 'Frohman LA']",,,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Endocr Pract,Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,9607439,,IM,"['*Diabetes Insipidus/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Drinking/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hypernatremia/complications/epidemiology', 'Morbidity', 'Obesity/complications/epidemiology', 'Thirst/physiology', 'Venous Thromboembolism/complications/epidemiology']",,,,2015/09/25 06:00,2016/08/09 06:00,['2015/09/25 06:00'],"['2015/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1530-891X(20)36000-6 [pii]', '10.4158/EP15940.RA [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr Pract. 2016 Jan;22(1):76-83. doi: 10.4158/EP15940.RA.

Recently, CDI has been reported as a rare side effect triggered by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in cancer patients. Despite its current rarity, CDI triggered by ICI is expected to affect an increasing number of patients because of the expanding use of these effective drugs in a growing number of solid and hematologic malignancies. An appropriate assessment of the severity of adverse events induced by anticancer agents is crucial in their management, including dosing adjustment and temporary withdrawal or discontinuation treatment. However, assessment of the severity of CDI induced by ICI may be challenging, as its main signs and symptoms (polyuria, dehydration, weight loss, and hypernatremia) can be incompletely graded. Indeed, the current grading system of toxicity induced by anticancer treatments does not include polyuria. Additionally, dehydration in patients affected by diabetes insipidus, including ICI-induced CDI, is different in certain aspects from that due to other conditions seen in cancer patients, such as vomiting and diarrhea. This prompted us to reflect on the need to grade polyuria, and how to grade it, and to consider a specific grading system for dehydration associated with CDI induced by ICI. Here we propose a new grading system for polyuria and dehydration, as critical symptoms of the CDI syndrome occurring in patients on ICI treatment, to obtain better management of both the adverse event and the triggering drugs.","['Copyright (c) 2022 Barnabei, Strigari, Corsello, Paragliola, Iannantuono,', 'Salvatori, Corsello and Torino.']","['Barnabei, Agnese', 'Strigari, Lidia', 'Corsello, Andrea', 'Paragliola, Rosa Maria', 'Iannantuono, Giovanni Maria', 'Salvatori, Roberto', 'Corsello, Salvatore Maria', 'Torino, Francesco']","['Barnabei A', 'Strigari L', 'Corsello A', 'Paragliola RM', 'Iannantuono GM', 'Salvatori R', 'Corsello SM', 'Torino F']",,"['Endocrinology Unit, Presidio Ospedaliero Santo Spirito in Sassia, Azienda Sanitaria Locale Roma 1, Rome, Italy.', 'Medical Physics Department, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine and Surgery, Unit of Endocrinology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore-Fondazione Policlinico ""Gemelli"" Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine and Surgery, Unit of Endocrinology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore-Fondazione Policlinico ""Gemelli"" Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Systems Medicine, Medical Oncology, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism and Pituitary Center, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Department of Translational Medicine and Surgery, Unit of Endocrinology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore-Fondazione Policlinico ""Gemelli"" Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Rome, Italy.', 'UniCamillus Chair of Endocrinology, Saint Camillus International University of Health Sciences, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Systems Medicine, Medical Oncology, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),Frontiers in endocrinology,101555782,['0 (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Dehydration/complications/drug therapy', '*Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic/complications', '*Diabetes Mellitus/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/adverse effects', '*Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Polyuria/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology']",PMC8978963,['NOTNLM'],"['CTCAE', 'central diabetes insipidus', 'endocrine toxicities', 'grading system', 'immune checkpoint inhibitors']",2022/04/08 06:00,2022/04/09 06:00,['2022/04/07 05:30'],"['2021/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2022/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/04/07 05:30 [entrez]', '2022/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fendo.2022.840971 [doi]'],epublish,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2022 Mar 21;13:840971. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2022.840971. eCollection 2022.,20220321,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although in Spanish pedigrees' WFS1 mutations are frequently located in exon 4, this finding is very infrequent in other pedigrees, particularly in Italian patients. CONCLUSIONS: a) our report of two siblings with one novel WSF1 mutation (G107R) expands the molecular spectrum of WS; b) this is the 3rd report of Italian patients harbouring one mutation outside exon 8 and the 2nd with one mutation in exon 4; c) on the basis of the present observations, and literature data we can infer that mutation locations outside exon 8 do not seem to be clearly associated with peculiar phenotype expressions of WFS1 gene.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This condition is easily diagnosed by measuring urinary concentrating capacity during a thirst test (e.g. 12 hours of water deprivation) or by administration of a modified antidiuretic hormone, desmopressin, to demonstrate the renal unresponsiveness. Drug-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is not a common disorder except in patients receiving treatment with lithium salts for affective disorders where it may affect about 10% of patients treated long term (15 years). Drug-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus caused by other drugs usually occurs in critically ill patients in intensive care units receiving a multitude of drugs dominated by antimicrobials and cytostatics. A search of the World Health Organization's adverse effect database revealed 359 reports of drug-induced diabetes insipidus. Lithium was the most common cause (159 reports) followed by foscarnet (15) and clozapine (10). Treatment is symptomatic in most patients and the offending drug should be stopped. If urine volumes exceed 4 L/day, treatment with thiazides and amiloride has been advocated, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as indomethacin, may be tried in severe cases. Prevention of lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is an important aspect of the treatment of affective disorders. In patients treated long term it appears to be only partly reversible upon lithium discontinuation. Close monitoring of the treatment aiming at 12-hour trough value of 0.4 to 0.6 mmol/L is recommended. Yearly measurement of the urinary volume/day is effective in making both the patient and the physician aware of the development of the drug-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The condition is a serious adverse effect because of the risk of developing dehydration and aggravation of drug intoxications.",,"['Bendz, H', 'Aurell, M']","['Bendz H', 'Aurell M']",,"['Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drug Saf,Drug safety,9002928,['9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Diabetes Insipidus/*chemically induced/epidemiology/*prevention & control/therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lithium/*adverse effects', 'Renal Insufficiency/*complications']",,,,1999/12/28 00:00,1999/12/28 00:01,['1999/12/28 00:00'],"['1999/12/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/12/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/12/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00002018-199921060-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Saf. 1999 Dec;21(6):449-56. doi: 10.2165/00002018-199921060-00002.,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORTS: Four children aged 2 years 5 months to 8 years with idiopathic diabetes insipidus were studied. Their condition had been identified for 2-6 years. All the patients had undergone complete clinical, neurological and endocrinological investigations during the search for the cause of their diabetes insipidus. A CT scan was performed in one patient and MRI in all four; the investigations were repeated each 6 months for 4 years. RESULTS: The first examination showed complete lack of antidiuretic hormone (four patients) and growth hormone deficiency (two patients). An enlarged pituitary stalk was seen in three patients, one patient had a small anterior pituitary, and three patients gave no posterior pituitary hypersignal. Follow-up showed that three patients completely lacked of growth hormone. One was thyrotropin deficient, three had persistent enlarged pituitary stalks, three had sub-normal anterior pituitaries and all four patients produced no post-pituitary hypersignal. None of the patients developed signs of histiocytosis or germinoma. CONCLUSION: The finding of abnormal pituitary stalks by MRI raises the possibility that the apparently idiopathic diabetes insipidus is due to some type of infiltrating disease of the hypothalamus and pituitary.",,"['Banerjee, A', 'Leger, J', 'Garel, C', 'Hassan, M', 'Czernichow, P']","['Banerjee A', 'Leger J', 'Garel C', 'Hassan M', 'Czernichow P']",,"[""Service d'endocrinologie-diabetologie, hopital Robert-Debre, Paris, France.""]",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Arch Pediatr,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,9421356,"['9002-71-5 (Thyrotropin)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diabetes Insipidus/*diagnosis/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Hormone/deficiency', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Pituitary Gland, Posterior/*pathology', 'Thyrotropin/deficiency']",,,,1994/03/01 00:00,2000/05/05 09:00,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pediatr. 1994 Mar;1(3):233-40.,,,,Anomalies morphologiques de la tige pituitaire sans cause reconnue dans quatre cas de diabete insipide de l'enfant.,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, its recognition is important to avoid complications due to dehydration and hypernatremia. Its manifestation during pregnancy ranges from exacerbation of pre-existing central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus to transient pregnancy-induced diabetes insipidus due to the increased metabolism of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (AVP) by the placental vasopressinase. Diagnosis can be challenging, as urinary frequency is common during pregnancy and primary polydipsia also needs to be excluded. Also, the standard water deprivation test is not recommended during pregnancy due to the increased risk of complications.

Unexpectedly, the symptoms resolved spontaneously during hospitalization but were aggravated 2 weeks after discharge, with the patient presenting a Cushingoid appearance. Investigations ruled out diabetes mellitus and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus but indicated adrenocortical suppression by exogenous glucocorticoids, which were discovered via toxicologic analysis of her previously compounded omeprazole suspension. After discontinuing the omeprazole suspension, the infant recovered fully and the laboratory results normalized. This case shows us that the assumption of appropriate medication intake may conceal unexpected medication errors. Following this case, the current literature on the benefits and risks of compounding and its impact on patient health is discussed.","['Copyright (c) 2023 French Society of Pediatrics.

Patients with severe and uncompensated symptoms may develop marked dehydration, neurologic symptoms and encephalopathy, and therefore diabetes insipidus can be a life-threatening condition if not properly diagnosed and managed. Patients with diabetes insipidus require treatment with desmopressin or drugs increasing sensitivity of the distal nephron to vasopressin, but this treatment may be confusing because of the disorder's variable pathophysiology and side-effects of pharmacotherapy.

METHODS: Clinical data of the patients were collected. High-throughput sequencing was carried out to detect potential variants. Sanger sequencing was used to verify the results. RESULTS: The patients were all males, with the age of onset being 10 to 21 days. All patients were admitted to the hospital for intermittent fever as the first symptom during the neonatal period. Additional symptoms had included polydipsia and polyuria. After the treatment, 5 patients had recovered, the remainders still had NDI symptoms and developmental retardation. Five children were found to harbor pathogenic variants of the AVPR2/AQP2 gene, which included one in-frame mutation of c.645_646insGCACCTACCCTGGGTATCGCC, two missense mutations of c.541C>T and c.419C>A, and two hemizygous deletions of the AVPR2/AQP2 gene. Among these, two were unreported previously. Cases 6 and 7 were a pair of twins. Both had carried homozygous missense variants of c.538G>A of the AVPR2/AQP2 gene, which was known to be pathogenic. CONCLUSION: AVPR2/AQP2 is the main pathogenic gene for congenital NDI, for which two novel pathogenic variants have been discovered in this study.

The known causes include germinoma/craniopharyngioma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), local inflammatory, autoimmune or vascular diseases, trauma resulting from surgery or an accident, sarcoidosis, metastases and midline cerebral and cranial malformations. In rare cases, the underlying cause can be genetic defects in vasopressin synthesis that are inherited as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive traits. The diagnosis of the underlying condition is challenging and raises several concerns for patients and parents as it requires long-term follow-up. Proper etiological diagnosis can be achieved via a series of steps that start with clinical observations and then progress to more sophisticated tools. Specifically, MRI identification of pituitary hyperintensity in the posterior part of the sella, now considered a clear marker of neurohypophyseal functional integrity, together with the careful analysis of pituitary stalk shape and size, have provided the most striking findings contributing to the diagnosis and understanding of some forms of 'idiopathic' CDI. MRI STIR (short-inversion-time inversion recovery sequencing) is a promising technology for the early identification of LCH-dependent CDI.","['Copyright (c) 2012 S.

Here we report a disturbance in VP precursor processing in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of WS patients. In these patients with diabetes insipidus we could hardly detect any cellular immunoreactivity for processed VP in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. On the other hand, in the paraventricular nucleus a considerable number of cells immunoreactive for the VP precursor were present. In addition, the proprotein convertase PC2 and the molecular chaperone 7B2 were absent. As expression of PC2 and 7B2 was detected in the nearby nucleus basalis of Meynert of one WS patient and in the anterior lobe of the other WS patient, the absence of the two proteins in the paraventricular nucleus was not due to mutations in their genes.

Recent advances in molecular genetics].,299-303,,"Hereditary diabetes insipidus can occur in two forms: the first, referred to as central diabetes insipidus, is responsive to vasopressin whereas the second, termed nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, is resistant to treatment. Recent advances in molecular genetics have contributed to elucidate the pathogenesis of these affections. Familial central diabetes insipidus depicts two unsimilar illnesses. The first, characterized by an autosomal dominant transmission, is of delayed onset and worsens progressively all through life. It is related to a heterozygous mutation of the vasopressin precursor gene mainly involving either the sequence encoding for the signal peptide or the one encoding for neurophysin II, the hormone carrier protein. Mutations described to date are responsible for impairment of vasopressin precursor transportation and processing. Therefore mutant protein accumulates in the posterior pituitary which is involved in the persistant bright spot seen on magnetic resonance imaging. The second illness or Wolfram syndrome, autosomal recessive, associates obligatory features: insulin-dependant diabetes, bilateral optic atrophy and more inconstantly: diabetes insipidus, deafness, genito-urinary and neuropsychiatric disturbances. The cause of this syndrome, still unknown, may involve mitochondrial ADN mutations. Familial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, of neonatal onset, are mainly X-linked and associated to mutations in the V2 receptor gene. About 60 mutations have been described until now. Some rare cases, transmission of which is autosomal recessive, result from homozygous mutations of aquaporin 2 gene, a water channel involved in the water reabsorption in the renal collecting duct. Other mutations will be probably discovered in future. In conclusion, familial diabetes insipidus constitutes an interesting pathogenic model because it may be explained by impairment of vasopressin gene precursor as well as by abnormalities of renal receptor or post receptor mechanisms of the hormone.",,"['Vantyghem, M C', 'Hober, C', 'Lefebvre, J']","['Vantyghem MC', 'Hober C', 'Lefebvre J']",,"[""Service d'Endocrinologie et Metabolismes, USN A, Lille.""]",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,,IM,"['Animals', 'Diabetes Insipidus/*congenital/genetics/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation']",,,,1996/02/24 00:00,1996/02/24 00:01,['1996/02/24 00:00'],"['1996/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Presse Med. 1996 Feb 24;25(7):299-303.,,,30,Diabetes insipides congenitaux.

ARDS is defined as a diffuse and inflammatory injury of the lungs; classifying this as severe when the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to a fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) is equal to or lower than 100 mmHg. To decide if the patient was suitable for the use of ECMO therapy, the ELSO criteria were used; and in this case, the patient matched with the criteria of hypoxemic respiratory failure (with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 80 mmHg) after optimal medical management, including, in the absence of contraindications, a trial of prone positioning. During hospitalization, the patient presented a Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI), probably explained by the damage hypoxia generated on the central nervous system. There are few reports of this complication produced by COVID-19. The case is about a 39-year-old woman, who started with ECMO 6 days after the beginning of Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV), because of a severe ARDS. On the fifth day of ECMO, the patient started with a polyuria of 7 L in 24 h. A series of paraclinical studies were made, but no evidence of central nervous system lesions was found. After treatment with desmopressin was initiated and the ARDS was solved, polyuria stopped; with this, CDI was diagnosed.

Exact localization of the antidiuretic defect in patients with hypotonic polyuria can be challenging, especially the distinction of primary polydipsia from partial pituitary or renal forms of diabetes insipidus. However, diagnostic precision is vital since therapeutic management differs substantially and false treatment may result in serious consequences.A main limitation of the indirect water deprivation test is its limited accuracy to correctly distinguish between the pathophysiologically distinct forms of hypotonic polyuria with a residual antidiuretic capacity. Direct detection of the osmotically-sensitive AVP reserve may be diagnostically superior but is technically difficult and not available for clinical routine, having left indirect diagnostic readouts the only accepted method for differentiating polyuric states, despite a diagnostic accuracy of only 70 %.New data demonstrate that selective measurement of plasma copeptin, a reliable AVP surrogate, not only captures patients with underlying renal defect, but critically improves diagnostic differentiation between primary polydipsia and pituitary forms of central diabetes insipidus.This manuscript presents the novel findings in the field and interprets their clinical consequences.",['(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Maternal hyperglycemia exerts epigenetic effects on genes that encode IEM-associated enzymes, resulting in changes in the neonatal blood metabolome. However, the relationship between maternal gut microbiota and the neonatal blood metabolome remains poorly understood. This study aimed at understanding the connections between maternal gut microbiota and the neonatal blood metabolome in GDM. 1H-NMR-based untargeted metabolomics was performed on maternal fecal samples and targeted metabolomics on the matched neonatal dry blood spots from a cohort of 40 pregnant women, including 22 with GDM and 18 controls. Multi-omic association methods (including Co-Inertia Analysis and Procrustes Analysis) were applied to investigate the relationship between maternal fecal metabolome and the neonatal blood metabolome. Both maternal fecal metabolome and the matched neonatal blood metabolome could be separated along the vector of maternal hyperglycemia. A close relationship between the maternal and neonatal metabolomes was observed by multi-omic association approaches. Twelve out of thirty-two maternal fecal metabolites with altered abundances from 872 1H- NMR features (Bonferroni-adjusted P < 0.05) in women with GDM and the controls were identified, among which 8 metabolites contribute (P < 0.05 in a 999-step permutation test) to the close connection between maternal and the neonatal metabolomes in GDM. Four of these eight maternal fecal metabolites, including lysine, putrescine, guanidinoacetate, and hexadecanedioate, were negatively associated (Spearman rank correlation, coefficient value < -0.6, P < 0.05) with maternal hyperglycemia. Biotin metabolism was enriched (Bonferroni-adjusted P < 0.05 in the hypergeometric test) with the four-hyperglycemia associated fecal metabolites. The results of this study suggested that maternal fecal metabolites contribute to the connections between maternal fecal metabolome and the neonatal blood metabolome and may further affect the risk of IEMs.",,"['Zhao, Chunchao', 'Ge, Jun', 'Li, Xia', 'Jiao, Ruifen', 'Li, Yuan', 'Quan, Huili', 'Li, Jianguo', 'Guo, Qing', 'Wang, Wenju']","['Zhao C', 'Ge J', 'Li X', 'Jiao R', 'Li Y', 'Quan H', 'Li J', 'Guo Q', 'Wang W']",,"['Shijiazhuang Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Shijiazhuang, 050000, PR China.', 'Shijiazhuang Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Shijiazhuang, 050000, PR China.', 'Shijiazhuang Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Shijiazhuang, 050000, PR China.', 'Shijiazhuang Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Shijiazhuang, 050000, PR China.', 'Shijiazhuang Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Shijiazhuang, 050000, PR China.', 'Shijiazhuang Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Shijiazhuang, 050000, PR China.', 'Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, 030006, PR China. lijg@sxu.edu.cn.', 'Shijiazhuang Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Shijiazhuang, 050000, PR China. guoqingyz2019@163.com.', 'Shijiazhuang Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Shijiazhuang, 050000, PR China. wangwjsjz@126.com.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['Gestational Diabetes Insipidus'],IM,"['Adult', 'Diabetes Insipidus/*metabolism', '*Feces', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Metabolome', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/*metabolism']",PMC7046769,,,2020/02/29 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2019/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-60540-2 [pii]', '60540 [pii]', '10.1038/s41598-020-60540-2 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Feb 27;10(1):3660. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-60540-2.,20200227,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Its main clinical features are diabetes insipidus (DI), early-onset non-autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM), gradual loss of vision due to optic atrophy (OA) and deafness (D), hence the acronym DIDMOAD. Several other features from different systems have been reported such as urinary tract, neurological, and psychiatric abnormalities. In addition, endocrine disorders that can appear during childhood and adolescence include primary gonadal atrophy and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in males and menstrual cycle abnormalities in females. Further, anterior pituitary dysfunction with deficient GH and/or ACTH production have been described. Despite the lack of specific treatment for the disease and its poor life expectancy, early diagnosis and supportive care is important for timely identifying and adequately managing its progressive symptoms. The current narrative review focuses on the pathophysiology and the clinical features of the disease, with a special emphasis on its endocrine abnormalities that appear during childhood and adolescence.

Dominant transmission is by far the most common form. In these patients, symptoms develop gradually at various ages during childhood, progressing with complete penetrance to polyuria and polydipsia that is usually severe. In autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal DI (ADNDI), the mutant prohormone is folding deficient and consequently retained in the ER, where it forms amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates. Degradation by proteasomes occurs, but their clearance capacity appears to be insufficient. Postmortem studies in affected individuals suggest a neurodegenerative process confined to vasopressinergic neurons. Other forms of genetic neurohypophyseal DI include the very rare autosomal recessive type, also caused by mutations in the AVP gene, and complex multiorgan disorders, such as Wolfram syndrome. In all individuals where a congenital form of DI is suspected, including nephrogenic types, genetic analysis should be performed.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

Despite physiological modifications in hydroelectrolytic balance during normal pregnancy, the capacity of the kidney to concentrate urine is preserved, partially due to lower vasopressin secretion. CASE REPORT: A young woman developed diabetes insipidus during the third trimester of normal pregnancy. The disease regressed totally after delivery. However, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a persistent expansive intrasellar image with a high-intensity signal. DISCUSSION: Onset of diabetes insipidus is usually rapidly progressive in pregnancy. Occurring generally during the third trimester in normal pregnancies, diabetes insipidus is generally well tolerated and responds to dDAVP, usually without pituitary abnormally, and regresses after delivery. Two types are distinguished: partially latent diabetes insipidus occurring during pregnancy and due to a central rather than nephrogenic origin; and excessive vasopressinase activity leading to diabetes insipidus usually associated with liver anomalies and high frequency of pre-eclampsia. During normal pregnancy, the size of the anterior pituitary increases and the normal high-intensity signal in the posterior pituitary seen on MRI usually regresses or disappears. In diabetes insipidus, the posterior pituitary hypersignal image generally disappears, reflecting reduced vasopressin storage. Few observations of diabetes insipidus occurring during pregnancy have been reported with morphological explorations. Most have described a ""normal"" aspect of the pituitary, specifically in the post partum period. In our patient, the weak vasopressin response to the end of water restriction at post partum when the diabetes insipidus symptoms had disappeared would suggest partial central diabetes insipidus revealed by pregnancy. Other pathologies involving this region could also be involved due to the unusual and persistent sellar image, with an expansive process showing a high intensity signal on MRI. An asymptomatic craniopharyngioma cyst was hypothesized and would be more compatible with the observed symptoms.",,"['Fluteau-Nadler, S', 'Bremont, C', 'Billaud, L', 'Thomopoulos, P', 'Luton, J P']","['Fluteau-Nadler S', 'Bremont C', 'Billaud L', 'Thomopoulos P', 'Luton JP']",,"['Clinique des Maladies endocriniennes et metaboliques, Hopital Cochin, Paris.']",['fre'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,"['0 (Renal Agents)', 'ENR1LLB0FP (Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Deamino Arginine Vasopressin/therapeutic use', 'Diabetes Insipidus/drug therapy/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*abnormalities/pathology', 'Kidney/physiopathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/diagnosis/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Third', 'Renal Agents/therapeutic use']",,,,1998/10/13 00:00,1998/10/13 00:01,['1998/10/13 00:00'],"['1998/10/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/13 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Presse Med. 1998 Jun 20;27(22):1095-8.,,,,Diabete insipide avec anomalie morphologique hypothalamo-hypophysaire au cours d'une grossesse.,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis was made on the basis of both dehydration test and sensitivity to exogenous vasopressin. The relationship between plasma and urine osmolality at the end of the dehydration test was evaluated (and its usefulness for diagnostic purpose confirmed). According to this test two different conditions, namely partial and complete, of cranial diabetes insipidus were defined. All the patients underwent the following diagnostic procedures: skull x-ray, evaluation of visual fields, encephalic CT-scan. Idiopathic central diabetes insipidus incidence was found to be 33.3% of all cases, with a sharp prevalence for male sex; the median age of onset was 12.5 years.

Postoperative diabetes insipidus (DI) is most often transient and observed in 1.6% to 34% of patients, whereas permanent DI has been reported in 0% to 2.7% of patients. The proposed mechanism was the transduction of traction forces exerted by the surgeon on the descended diaphragma sellae and through the pituitary stalk. OBJECTIVE: To quantify and correlate the degree of pituitary gland descent with postoperative DI. METHODS: Of 374 patients who underwent transsphenoidal resection of a pituitary adenoma between 2010 and 2020 at our institution, we report a cohort of 30 patients (Group A) DI. We also report a matched cohort by tumor volume of 30 patients who did not develop DI (Group B). We quantified the tension on the pituitary stalk by calculating pituitary descent interval (PDI) by comparing preoperative and postoperative position of the pituitary gland and using Pythagoras' formula where , with craniocaudal (CC) and anterior-posterior (AP) representing measurements of pituitary translation in respective directions after resection. RESULTS: Patients who developed DI had significantly greater pituitary gland translations in the craniocaudal (23.0 vs 16.3 mm, P = .0015) and anteroposterior (2.4 vs 1.5 mm, P = .0168) directions. Furthermore, Group A had a statistically greater PDI, which was associated with development of DI (23.2 vs 16.6 mm, P = .0017). CONCLUSION: We were able to quantify pituitary descent and subsequent tension on the pituitary stalk, while also associating it with development of postoperative DI after pituitary adenoma resection.",['Copyright (c) Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2023.

A gene responsible for Wolfram syndrome (WFS1) has been identified on the short arm of chromosome 4 and subsequently mutations in WFS1 have been described. We have screened 12 patients with Wolfram syndrome from nine Dutch families for mutations in the WFS1-coding region by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. Furthermore, we analyzed the mitochondrial genome for gross abnormalities and the A3243G point mutation in the leucyl-tRNA gene, because Wolfram syndrome shows phenotypic similarities with mitochondrial disease. Seven mutations in WFS1 were identified in six of nine families: two missense mutations, one frameshift mutation, one splice donor site mutation, and three deletions. In addition, a splice variant near the 5'UTR of WFS1 was identified, present in patient as well as control RNA samples in various percentages, alternating the translation initiation consensus sequence. Whether this WFS1 splice variant displays impaired translation efficiency remains to be determined. No MtDNA lesions were identified in any of the Wolfram patients. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of molecular analysis of WFS1 in the refinement of clinical diagnostic criteria for Wolfram syndrome that helps to dissect the clinically overlapping syndromes sharing diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy.",,"['van ven Ouweland, Johannes M W', 'Cryns, Kim', 'Pennings, Ronald J E', 'Walraven, Inge', 'Janssen, George M C', 'Maassen, J Antonie', 'Veldhuijzen, Bernard F E', 'Arntzenius, Alexander B', 'Lindhout, Dick', 'Cremers, Cor W R J', 'Van Camp, Guy', 'Dikkeschei, Lambert D']","['van ven Ouweland JM', 'Cryns K', 'Pennings RJ', 'Walraven I', 'Janssen GM', 'Maassen JA', 'Veldhuijzen BF', 'Arntzenius AB', 'Lindhout D', 'Cremers CW', 'Van Camp G', 'Dikkeschei LD']",,"['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Isala Klinieken, Weezenlanden, Zwolle, The Netherlands. j.m.van.den.ouweland@path.azg.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl)', '0 (wolframin protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alternative Splicing', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/metabolism', 'Diabetes Mellitus/genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Optic Atrophy/genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Wolfram Syndrome/*diagnosis/*genetics']",PMC1907324,,,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/12/13 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-1578(10)60457-6 [pii]', '0119 [pii]', '10.1016/s1525-1578(10)60457-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2003 May;5(2):88-95. doi: 10.1016/s1525-1578(10)60457-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
