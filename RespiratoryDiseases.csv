As natural nanocarriers, exosomes contain a variety of signal substances of the mother cell: nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, etc., which always play a vital role in the transmission of signal molecules between different cells. Epithelial cells are the first-line defense system against various inhaled allergens causing chronic respiratory diseases (CRD), such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It's noted that increasing literature shows the exosomes derived from epithelial cells are involved in the pathogenesis of CRD. Moreover, the correlations between exosome cargo and the disease phenotypes show a high potential of using exosomes as biomarkers of CRD.

We reviewed and summarized recent research (human subjects, animal studies, in vitro studies) on zinc in respiratory diseases to explore the protective mechanism of zinc from the perspective of regulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, lipid metabolism, and apoptosis. In the lungs, zinc has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral effects; can inhibit cancer cell migration; can regulate lipid metabolism and immune cells; and exerts other protective effects.

The observed associations might be explained by a role of H. pylori infection in the pathogenesis of certain extra-digestive disorders, as a variety of inflammatory mediators are activated by H. pylori infection. The present review summarizes the current literature, including our own studies, concerning the association between respiratory diseases and H. pylori infection. A small number of epidemiological and serologic case-control studies suggest that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have an increased seroprevalence of H. pylori. A frequent coexistence of bronchiectasis and H. pylori infection has also been found. Moreover, recent studies have shown an increased prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and in those with lung cancer. On the other hand, bronchial asthma does not seem to be related to H. pylori infection. At present, there is no definite proof of a causal relationship between H. pylori and respiratory diseases. The primary evidence rests on case-control studies, concerning relatively small numbers of patients.

Patients with CRDs usually require co-administration of multiple drugs due to the complex pathogenic mechanisms of CRDs and the existence of concomitant diseases. Polypharmacy (co-administration of more than four medications) is the main risk factor of the occurrence of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that may lead to reducing treatment efficacy and/or increasing adverse effects. METHODS: This literature-based review focuses on metabolism-based DDIs, the most prevalent DDIs responsible for difficulties in therapeutic management in patients with CRDs. RESULTS: Clinically relevant metabolism-based DDIs occur between drugs used for the treatment of respiratory diseases (corticosteroids, orally inhaled bronchodilators, methylxanthines, anti-leukotrienes, antimicrobials, endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, antitussives, and antineoplastic agents) and drugs affecting cytochrome P450 (CYP) (inducers and inhibitors). Considering alternative therapies, adjusting medication doses, or monitoring patients during treatment are recommended to prevent the harmful consequences of these interactions. CONCLUSION: Providing information on clinically relevant interactions of drugs more likely prescribed in daily practices of physicians is essential to improve patient safety. A list of known metabolism-based interactions of drugs affecting the respiratory systems should be available for physicians engaged in the treatment of CRDs.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Baniasadi, Shadi']",['Baniasadi S'],,"['Tracheal Diseases Research Center, National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Drug Metab,Current drug metabolism,100960533,['0 (Respiratory System Agents)'],IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Respiratory System/drug effects', 'Respiratory System Agents/*adverse effects', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*drug therapy/*metabolism']",,,2020/10/29 06:00,2021/10/09 06:00,['2020/10/28 05:27'],"['2020/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/28 05:27 [entrez]']","['CDM-EPUB-109384 [pii]', '10.2174/1389200221999200820164038 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Metab. 2020;21(9):704-713. doi: 10.2174/1389200221999200820164038.,9,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic respiratory diseases', 'cytochrome P450', 'drug-drug interactions', 'enzyme inducers', 'enzyme inhibitors', 'metabolism', 'respiratory system', 'uridine glucuronosyl transferases']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In spite of that, there are still massive challenges that have not been resolved. Although the incidence of tuberculosis has decreased in the developed world, it is still a significant public health problem in the rest of the world. There are still over 2 million deaths annually from tuberculosis, with most of these occurring in the developing world. Even with the development of new pharmaceuticals to treat tuberculosis, there is no indication that the disease will be eradicated.

Even in developed countries such as the USA, there are over 4,000 deaths per year. Severe asthma presents a special problem, but the question is whether there can be one treatment pathway for all patients with severe asthma. Severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease with many phenotypes and endotypes. The gene for cystic fibrosis was discovered over 24 years ago. The promise of gene therapy as a cure for the disease has fizzled out, and while new antimicrobials and other pharmaceuticals promise improved longevity and better quality of life, the average life span of a patient with cystic fibrosis is still at about 35 years.

However, the safety and tolerance for lung disorders are controversy. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analyses of all 23 clinical studies of cell therapy. The outcomes were odds ratio (OR), risk difference (RD), Peto OR, relative risk, and mean difference of serious adverse events. RESULTS: 342 systemic infusions and 57 bronchial instillations (204 recipients) of cells were analyzed for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary arterial hypertension, silicosis, sarcoidosis, extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The frequency of death in adults from any causes was 71 and 177 per 1,000 for cell therapy and controls, respectively, with an OR of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.03, 3.76) and RD of -0.22 (95% CI: -0.53, 0.09). No significant difference was found for ARDS and COPD. The frequency of deaths and non-fatal serious adverse events of 17 open studies were similar to those of randomized controlled trials. Moreover, serious adverse events of allogenic cells were greater than autologous preparations, as shown by frequency, OR and RD. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that either infusion or instillation of mesenchymal stem stromal or progenitor cells are well tolerated without serious adverse events causally related to cell treatment.

Accumulating evidence suggests that oral disorders, particularly periodontal disease, may influence the course of respiratory infections like bacterial pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral periodontopathic bacteria can be aspirated into the lung causing aspiration pneumonia. The teeth may also serve as a reservoir for respiratory pathogen colonization and subsequent nosocomial pneumonia. The overreaction of the inflammatory process that leads to the destruction of the connective tissue is present in both periodontal disease and emphysema. This overreaction may explain the association between periodontal disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The mechanisms of infection could be the aspiration into the lung of oral pathogens capable of causing pneumonia, colonization of dental plaque by respiratory pathogens followed by aspiration, or facilitation of colonization of the upper airway by pulmonary pathogens by periodontal pathogens.

Pneumonia and influenza constitute the sixth leading cause of death among Indians and the fifth leading cause of death among the U.S. All Races population. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the fourth leading cause of death among U.S. All Races, but only the tenth leading cause of death among Indians. Pneumonia and tuberculosis are more significant causes of death and disability for Indians than are COPD and cancer of the lung. The explanation for these differences in mortality rates between Indians and the general population are not known. Respiratory system diseases are responsible for 10.6% of Indian hospitalizations. The most frequent is pneumonia, which accounts for approximately 4% of all Indian hospitalizations.

Due to the nature of these diseases, accurate, practical, and objective measurement techniques are needed in field investigations. Pulmonary function tests, such as spirometry, are important objective health outcome measures. However, they reflect the functional changes of the lung, often in relatively late stages, which may be irreversible. Direct monitoring of airways inflammations, in response to occupational exposures, are receiving an increasing attention since they may pick up inflammatory changes before the injury becomes irreversible. Invasive approaches such as bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial biopsies have been used to assess airways inflammation: but these methods are not practical for use in occupational field investigations. Thus, much work has focused on the development of noninvasive methods for monitoring inflammation in occupational respiratory diseases. The three recent most commonly used noninvasive techniques in occupational respiratory diseases investigations are induced sputum, exhaled breath condensate, and nasal lavage. In this review, we discuss the practical application of these techniques, patents and cytokines measured with them. Since variation of cytokine genes contribute to the inflammatory processes, we briefly discuss the genetic polymorphisms on the expression of occupational respiratory diseases.

H(2)S also regulates respiratory functions such as airway constriction, pulmonary circulation, cell proliferation or apoptosis, fibrosis, oxidative stress, and neurogenic inflammation. Cross-talk between H(2)S and other gasotransmitters also affects the net outcome of lung function.

The activation of inflammatory mediators by H. pylori seems to be the pathogenetic mechanism underlying the observed associations. The present review summarizes the current literature, including our own studies, concerning the association between H. pylori infection and respiratory diseases. A small number of epidemiological and serologic, case-control studies suggest that H. pylori infection may be associated with the development of chronic bronchitis. A frequent coexistence of pulmonary tuberculosis and H. pylori infection has also been found. Moreover, recent studies have shown an increased H. pylori seroprevalence in patients with bronchiectasis and in those with lung cancer. On the other hand, bronchial asthma seems not to be related with H. pylori infection. All associations between H. pylori infection and respiratory diseases are primarily based on case-control studies, concerning relatively small numbers of patients. Moreover, there is a lack of studies focused on the pathogenetic link between respiratory diseases and H. pylori infection.

Nasal septum deviation was found in 50% of individuals, asymmetry of the frontal sinuses and their aplasia in 11% of individuals. There was no significant relationship between the curvature of the nasal septum and frontal sinus aplasia. One case of tuberculosis and one case of periradicular abscess causing perforation of the maxillary sinus were noted. Developmental variation of the sternum was present in two individuals.

There are emerging data that hyaluronan and its degradation products have an important role in the pathobiology of the respiratory tract. We review the role of hyaluronan in respiratory diseases and present evidence from published literature and from clinical practice supporting hyaluronan as a novel treatment for respiratory diseases. Preliminary data show that aerosolized exogenous hyaluronan has beneficial activity against airway inflammation, protects against bronchial hyperreactivity and remodeling, and disrupts the biofilm associated with chronic infection. This suggests a role in airway diseases with a predominant inflammatory component such as rhinosinusitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and primary ciliary dyskinesia.

The mechanism of AMP is indirect and occurs via its decay product, adenosine. It stimulates mast cells through its low-affinity receptor A2B to release histamine, which ultimately leads to smooth muscle contraction. This feature of adenosine reveals its pro-inflammatory function, which may play important role in asthma. Indeed, mice lacking adenosine deaminase (ADA), an enzyme which decomposes adenosine, develop asthma-like disorder with elevated IgE, eosinophilia and airway hyperresponsiveness. Human studies showed elevated adenosine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage and exhaled breath condensate of asthmatics as compared to healthy people. Furthermore, certain human ADA phenotypes are associated with prevalence of asthma. These data suggest a protective role for ADA and a pro-inflammatory function for adenosine in asthma. The role of adenosine in inflammatory processes, however, is not unequivocal. Some in vitro studies showed that adenosine binding to its high-affinity receptor A2A results in inhibition of leukotriene synthesis or function of adhesion molecules. It is possible that the concentration of adenosine in lung tissues determines whether it promotes or reduces inflammation. Adenosine has also been associated with other respiratory diseases such as fibrosis, sarcoidosis, cystic fibrosis or tuberculosis. Identification of adenosine receptor subtypes and their role in the pathomechanism of respiratory diseases may provide new therapeutical targets.

The necessity of very careful monitoring of neonates, which is critical to early detection of disease, should be stressed. As respiratory diseases can be fulminant and rapidly fatal, it is imperative not to delay diagnosis and therapy. Thorough examination and implementation of appropriate diagnostic techniques, as well as prompt early referral to a more sophisticated facility when indicated, would prevent many deaths. Although sophisticated support systems are vital for survival of some of these foals, good basic intensive nursing care combined with selection of appropriate drug therapy very early in the course of the disease is all that many foals require and can significantly improve survival rates.",,"['Beech, J']",['Beech J'],,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Vet Clin North Am Equine Pract,The Veterinary clinics of North America.

In addition to its gastrointestinal problems, GERD has been linked to a variety of respiratory diseases either as a direct cause, or as a risk factor to the inability to control or worsening of the disease. AREAS COVERED: We performed a literature search in the PubMed database for articles addressing GERD and pulmonary diseases. This review will discuss several different pulmonary diseases affected by GERD ranging from upper airway including chronic cough, vocal cord dysfunction, lower airway diseases including COPD, asthma, and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome to parenchymal diseases such as interstitial lung diseases. The review will discuss several different pulmonary manifestations of GERD and their contribution to patient mortality and morbidity. It will also review the mechanisms leading to these diseases, diagnostic workup, and the role of the available treatment options. EXPERT OPINION: GERD is often overlooked as a cause of respiratory symptoms and illnesses. The literature is sparse on the relation between GERD and respiratory diseases such as interstitial lung diseases and bronchiolitis obliterans including its role in pathogenesis, mechanisms of lung injury, and whether treatment of GERD is effective in managing such illnesses.",,"['Griffiths, Tricia L', ""Nassar, Mo'ath"", 'Soubani, Ayman O']","['Griffiths TL', 'Nassar M', 'Soubani AO']",,"['Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine , Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine , Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine , Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200427,England,Expert Rev Respir Med,Expert review of respiratory medicine,101278196,,IM,"['Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cough', 'Gastroesophageal Reflux/*complications/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial', 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Vocal Cord Dysfunction']",,,2020/04/21 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/04/21 06:00'],"['2020/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17476348.2020.1758068 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Respir Med. 2020 Aug;14(8):767-775. doi: 10.1080/17476348.2020.1758068.

METHODS: The most recent disaggregated mortality database (data from 86 countries) available from the World Health Organization using the ICD-10 was reviewed. RESULTS: Respiratory problems caused 16.6% of the deaths in the countries analysed (95%CI 7.9-27.1); 61% were considered chronic respiratory ailments (95%CI 17-85). Of all respiratory-related deaths, 44% were outside Group J and 7.8% were hidden in codes other than J, thoracic tumours, tuberculosis and diseases of pulmonary circulation. Hidden respiratory deaths were more common in low-income countries, but approximately 5% of respiratory deaths in high-income countries were also hidden. Respiratory deaths were the leading cause of death in five countries even when compared to the total number of cardiovascular and cancer deaths.

While understanding of these diseases has improved, treatment guidelines have continued to rely on severity and exacerbation-based approaches. A new personalised approach, termed the ""treatable traits"" approach, has been suggested to address the limitations of the existing treatment strategies. We aim to systematically review the current evidence regarding treatable traits in chronic respiratory diseases and to identify gaps in the current literature. We searched the PubMed and Embase databases and included studies on treatable traits and chronic respiratory diseases. We then extracted information on prevalence, prognostic implications, treatment options and benefits from these studies. A total of 58 papers was included for review. The traits identified were grouped into five broad themes: physiological, biochemical, psychosocial, microbiological, and comorbidity traits. Studies have shown advantages of the treatable traits paradigm in the clinical setting. However, few randomised controlled trials have been conducted. Findings from our review suggest that multidisciplinary management with therapies targeted at treatable traits has the potential to be efficacious when added to the best practices currently implemented.

There is increasing recognition that pulmonary hypertension is an important complication of many childhood respiratory diseases including cystic fibrosis, interstitial lung diseases, upper airways obstruction and disorders of the respiratory muscles and chest wall. Chronic hypoxaemia and, in some cases, destruction of the vascular bed are the key factors. The clinical features of pulmonary hypertension are often overshadowed by those of the primary respiratory disease but newer imaging techniques allow earlier detection of this complication. This may be important in the future if new specific therapies for primary pulmonary hypertension are shown to be beneficial in secondary pulmonary hypertension. With some conditions, such as airways obstruction due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy, treating the underlying cause leads to rapid resolution of the hypertension. However, with most disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, management is focused on treating the lung disease intensively and correcting the chronic hypoxaemia with oxygen therapy, sometimes augmented by nasal mask ventilation.

Particulate matter (PM) is one of the air pollutants most involved in the onset or exacerbation of respiratory conditions in children. Objective. To describe the characteristics of consultations for acute respiratory diseases in children younger than 15 years and the levels of PM in the air and to analyze their association in a sector of Bahia Blanca between April 2019 and March 2020. Population and methods. Ecological, time-series study with multiple groups. Descriptive analysis of total number of consultations, by area, diagnosis, and PM. Generalized linear correlation and regression model to determine the relationship among variables. The SPSS(R) software was used. Results. Data from 4787 consultations were collected. Of these, 38.6% (1846) were related to rhinitis and 21.1% (1011), to bronchospasm. PM of 10 nm (PM10) exceeded its limit value on 31% (115) of the study days, and PM of 2.5 nm (PM2.5), on 3% (8). A 10% increase in PM2.5 showed increases of 1.3% in total consultations; the increase reached 2.1% in the area closest to the industrial sector (p < 0.05). In the latter, a 10% increase in PM10 was associated with an increase of 1.8% in consultations (p < 0.05). Conclusion. A positive association was evidenced between consultations for acute respiratory diseases and PM levels in the air, especially with PM2.5 and in the area closest to the industrial sector.",['Sociedad Argentina de Pediatria.'],"['Buffone, Ignacio R', 'Romano, Horacio J']","['Buffone IR', 'Romano HJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2546-6010'],"['Department of Epidemiology and Quality, Secretariat of Public Health, Municipality of Bahia Blanca, Argentina.', 'Unit of Health Information Technology, Hospital Municipal de Agudos Dr. Leonidas Lucero, Bahia Blanca, Argentina.']","['eng', 'spa']",['Journal Article'],20221013,Argentina,Arch Argent Pediatr,Archivos argentinos de pediatria,0372460,['0 (Particulate Matter)'],IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Particulate Matter/analysis', '*Air Pollution/adverse effects/analysis', 'Brazil', 'Environmental Exposure/analysis', '*Respiratory Tract Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy']",,,2022/10/14 06:00,2023/01/31 06:00,['2022/10/13 10:07'],"['2022/10/13 10:07 [entrez]', '2022/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5546/aap.2022-02588.eng [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Argent Pediatr. 2023 Feb 1;121(1):e202202588. doi: 10.5546/aap.2022-02588.eng.

Despite advances in our understanding of the complex pathophysiology of respiratory diseases, as well as the availability of relatively straightforward primary prevention measures, the prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases continues to rise. In addition, periodic outbreaks of acute infectious respiratory conditions result in significant cost and even mortality, and the incidence of these conditions fluctuates widely from year to year. Although we have seen recent developments in medical therapies for respiratory diseases, and there are established and well-publicized disease management guidelines, morbidity and mortality remain high. One intervention that has lagged behind has been smoking prevention and cessation, which is the mainstay of prevention for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer.

Little information is available about their incidences over the past several decades. METHODS: Based on the reports of the three German federal accident insurance agencies, the numbers of suspected and recognized cases of occupational respiratory diseases between 1970 and 2005 were collected and combined. The trends in the rates per 100,000 insured workers were calculated. RESULTS: In total, a decline in occupational respiratory diseases since 1998 could be observed. This trend is mainly based on the decrease in non-malignant respiratory diseases due to silica and obstructive airway diseases. In contrast, asbestos-induced diseases showed a leveling off or an increase (mesothelioma) during the last 10years. CONCLUSIONS: Although trends in occupational disease may be influenced by several factors, the presented data indicate that prevention has been effective in reducing some ofthe most frequent occupational respiratory diseases in Germany.","['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['van Kampen, V', 'Merget, R', 'Butz, M', 'Taeger, D', 'Bruning, T']","['van Kampen V', 'Merget R', 'Butz M', 'Taeger D', 'Bruning T']",,"['BGFA, Research Institute of Occupational Medicine, German Social Accident Insurance, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany. kampen@bgfa.ruhr-uni-bochum.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,"['Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/classification/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/classification/*epidemiology/*etiology']",,,2008/05/21 09:00,2008/07/08 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.20593 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2008 Jul;51(7):492-502. doi: 10.1002/ajim.20593.,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authentic manuscript of the Canon of Medicine is located in the Central Library of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences, and the section on respiratory diseases was studied for the most relevant information - information that would be informative and interesting for present day physicians and pulmonologists. The results of the analysis are presented in the article. Respiratory diseases are discussed in depth in volume 3 of the Canon of Medicine. Avicenna discusses in detail the functional anatomy and physiopathology of the pulmonary diseases that were known in his time. He also describes the signs and symptoms of various respiratory diseases and conditions in the five chapters of volume 3 (breathing, voice, cough and hemoptysis, internal wounds and inflammations and principles of treatments) that are remarkably similar to those of modern pulmonary medicine. In addition, the herbal and nonherbal treatment of respiratory diseases and their signs and symptoms, mentioned in volume 2 of the Canon of Medicine, is also presented. In the time of Avicenna, the presentation of respiratory diseases, their treatment and their prognosis was much different than in modern times. There was more reliance on history, physical examination (which was mostly based on visual observation), individual variation, environmental factors, diet, and so on, for diagnosis and treatment.

OBJECTIVES: Describe respiratory diseases affecting cloned calves. ANIMALS: Twenty-five cloned Holstein calves. METHODS: Retrospective clinical study of the cloned calves born at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Saint-Hyacinthe, QC. RESULTS: Records of 31 cloned calves were reviewed. Twenty-five records were included. Four stillborn calves and 2 calves euthanized at birth were excluded. Twenty-two calves suffered from respiratory diseases. Nineteen calves received intranasal oxygen treatment (INO). They were tachypneic (78 breaths per minute) and 5 of them were hypoxemic (PaO(2) < 55 mmHg). Two of 19 calves remained hypoxemic despite INO. Thirteen calves were weaned from INO after a median of 70 hours and were discharged at a median of 5 days of age. Nine calves required ventilatory support: 3 from birth and 6 after INO. Five were successfully weaned from the ventilator after a median of 32 hours and were discharged at a median of 8 days of age. Three calves died and 1 was euthanized because of respiratory disease. Necropsy revealed atelectasis, pulmonary congestion, and alveolar damages. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Respiratory disease occurs frequently in cloned calves. The most frequent abnormality is hypoxemia because of V/Q mismatch. It is possible to successfully support these calves by INO and mechanical ventilation.",['Copyright (c) 2011 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.'],"['Brisville, A C', 'Fecteau, G', 'Boysen, S', 'Dorval, P', 'Buczinski, S', 'Blondin, P', 'Smith, L C']","['Brisville AC', 'Fecteau G', 'Boysen S', 'Dorval P', 'Buczinski S', 'Blondin P', 'Smith LC']",,"['Hopital des animaux de la Ferme, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Veterinaire, Faculte de Medecine Vete, Universite de Montreal, Saint-Hyacinthe, QC, Canada. anne-claire.brisville@umontreal.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110225,United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*epidemiology/genetics/therapy', '*Cloning, Organism', 'Female', 'Hypoxia/epidemiology/genetics/therapy/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Respiration, Artificial/methods/*veterinary', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/epidemiology/genetics/therapy/*veterinary', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2011/03/01 06:00,2011/04/19 06:00,['2011/03/01 06:00'],"['2011/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.0693.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 2011 Mar-Apr;25(2):373-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.0693.x.

However, few studies have investigated the contribution of weather to hospitalization related to the adverse effects of air pollution. This study analyzed the effects of particulate matter (PM) on daily respiratory-related hospital admissions, taking into account meteorological factors. METHODS: Daily hospital admissions for respiratory diseases (acute bronchitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma) between 2007 and 2010 were extracted from the National Health Insurance Corporation, Korea. Patients were divided into three age-based groups (0-15, 16-64, and >/=65 years). PM levels were obtained from 19 monitoring stations in Busan. RESULTS: The mean number of patients admitted for acute bronchitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma was 5.8 +/- 11.9, 4.4 +/- 6.1, and 3.3 +/- 3.3, respectively. During that time, the daily mean PM(10) and PM(2.5) concentrations were 49.6 +/- 20.5 and 24.2 +/- 10.9 mug/m(3), respectively. The mean temperature anomaly was 7.0 +/- 2.3  degrees C; the relative humidity was 62.0 +/- 18.0%. Hospital admission rates for respiratory diseases increased with increasing PM and temperature, and with decreasing relative humidity. A multivariate analysis including PM, temperature anomaly, relative humidity, and age showed a significant increase in respiratory-related admissions with increasing PM levels and a decreasing relative humidity. Higher PM(2.5) levels had a greater effect on respiratory-related hospital admission than did PM(10) levels. Children and the elderly were the most susceptible to hospital admission for respiratory disease. CONCLUSIONS: PM levels and meteorological factors impacted hospitalization for respiratory diseases, especially in children and the elderly. The effect of PM on respiratory diseases increased as the relative humidity decreased.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These flocks can be a substrate for respiratory disease amplification and transmission to commercial facilities. Five hundred fifty-four chickens from 41 backyard flocks were sampled in this study. ELISA kits were used to detect antibodies against avian influenza (AI), infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), Newcastle disease (ND), infectious bronchitis (IB), Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), and Mycoplasma synoviae (MS). All visited flock owners answered a biosecurity questionnaire that assessed biosecurity measures. The questionnaire revealed that backyard poultry owners lack simple biosecurity measures such as use of dedicated shoes, their chicken sources are unreliable, and few of them benefit from veterinary oversight. Only one flock had a clear vaccination history against ND and IB. ORT, ND, IB, MS, MG, and ILT were the most seroprevalent in backyard poultry flocks with 97% (41/42), 77.5% (31/40), 75% (30/40), 73% (31/42), 69% (29/42), and 45% (19/42), respectively. The vaccinated flock was not considered in these calculations. When examining the distance between backyard flocks and the nearest commercial poultry facility, ND and MG were significantly more likely to be found in backyard flocks close to (<4 miles) whereas ORT was significantly more likely in backyard chickens located far from (>4 miles) commercial poultry. Birds purchased directly from National Poultry Improvement Plan hatcheries showed a reduced ND, MG, and MS antibody prevalence. Wearing dedicated shoes decreased MS antibody-positive birds. Finally, history of wild bird contact had a clear effect on an increased seroprevalence of NDV and MG. Serological results suggest that backyard poultry flocks have the potential to serve as a reservoir or amplifier for poultry respiratory diseases. The information generated in this project should direct extension efforts toward emphasizing the importance of small flock biosecurity and chick acquisition sources.",,"['Derksen, T', 'Lampron, R', 'Hauck, R', 'Pitesky, M', 'Gallardo, R A']","['Derksen T', 'Lampron R', 'Hauck R', 'Pitesky M', 'Gallardo RA']",,"['A Department of Population Health and Reproduction, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, 1089 Veterinary Medicine Drive VM3B, Davis, CA 95616.', 'A Department of Population Health and Reproduction, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, 1089 Veterinary Medicine Drive VM3B, Davis, CA 95616.', 'B Department of Pathobiology and Department of Poultry Science, Auburn University, 302J Poultry Science Building, 260 Lem Morrison Drive, Auburn, AL 36849.', 'C University of California, School of Veterinary Medicine, Cooperative Extension, 1089 Veterinary Medicine Drive VM3B, Davis, CA 95616.', 'A Department of Population Health and Reproduction, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, 1089 Veterinary Medicine Drive VM3B, Davis, CA 95616.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,,IM,"['*Animal Husbandry/methods', 'Animals', 'California/epidemiology', '*Chickens', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Poultry Diseases/*epidemiology/microbiology/virology', 'Prevalence', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/epidemiology/microbiology/*veterinary/virology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",,,2018/04/06 06:00,2019/09/27 06:00,['2018/04/06 06:00'],"['2018/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1637/11672-050917-Reg.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Avian Dis. 2018 Mar;62(1):1-5. doi: 10.1637/11672-050917-Reg.1.,1,['NOTNLM'],"['backyard flock', 'biosecurity', 'commercial flock', 'respiratory diseases', 'seroprevalence']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: To analyze how restrictions applied during the management of air pollution critical episodes have contributed to reduce emergency room admissions for respiratory diseases in two Chilean cities between 2013 and 2019. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Poisson regression models were estimated with daily data including explanatory variables, such as the daily and lag concentration of respirable particulate material (PM10), temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind speed, seasonal factors, and implementation of different types of critical episodes. RESULTS: The implementation of restrictions during the management of critical pollution episodes decreased emergency room admissions for upper respiratory infections and bronchial obstructive crises, especially when an environmental emergency was decreed during the critical episode. However, the effect on each group of respiratory diseases was heterogeneous between cities, which could be related to avoidance behavior, indoor air pollution, the composition of PM10, or the presence of other pollutants, and not just a reduction in the daily concentration of PM10.

Here we explore and infer relationships among genes, diseases, and chemicals using network and matrix based clustering methods. RESULTS: In order to better understand and elucidate these shared genetic mechanisms and chemical relationships we analyzed a comprehensive collection of gene, disease, and chemical relationships pertinent to respiratory disease, using network and matrix based analysis approaches.

By monitoring and analyzing cough sounds through automatic devices, the farmer can obtain an early warning about a developing outbreak of respiratory infections. Cough sounds can be characterized by particular acoustic features (amplitude, frequency and duration) that are obtained by sound recording, labeling and analytic procedures. Based on these features, it might be possible to develop an automated cough recognition system. The aim of the study described in this paper is to investigate whether it is possible to discriminate cough sounds from other frequently occurring sounds in youngstock stables. Nasal swabs and blood were taken to identify the microbiological agents responsible for the respiratory problems. The collected cough sounds were compared to metal rack sounds, which are very common sounds in cattle farming, to identify acoustic differences between them. Results show that the length of cough sounds was significantly different from metal rack sounds (0.34 versus 0.37 s, P<0.05). Also, the analysis of amplitude and fundamental frequency showed significant differences between both types of sounds (resp. 0.21 and 0.18; 1326 and 3868 HZ). This indicates that it is possible discriminate cough sounds from other sounds and that cough sound can be used as a non-invasively diagnostic tool for respiratory diseases in youngstock groups.",['2010 Elsevier B.V.

Serum concentrations are low in healthy animals, but increase rapidly after inflammatory stimuli. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate CRP concentrations in various respiratory diseases of dogs and to determine if CRP can be used as a biomarker in the diagnosis of bacterial respiratory diseases. ANIMALS: A total of 106 privately owned dogs with respiratory diseases (17 with bacterial tracheobronchitis [BTB], 20 with chronic bronchitis [CB], 20 with eosinophilic bronchopneumopathy [EBP], 12 with canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [CIPF], 15 with cardiogenic pulmonary edema [CPE], and 22 with bacterial pneumonia [BP]) and 72 healthy controls. METHODS: The study was conducted as a prospective cross-sectional observational study. CRP was measured in serum samples. Diagnosis was confirmed by clinical and laboratory findings, diagnostic imaging, and selected diagnostic methods such as cytological and microbiological analysis of respiratory samples, echocardiography, and histopathology. RESULTS: Dogs with BP had significantly higher CRP concentrations (median, 121 mg/L; interquartile range, 68-178 mg/L) than dogs with BTB (23, 15-38, P = .0003), CB (13, 8-14, P < .0001), EBP (5, 5-15, P < .0001), CIPF (17, 10-20, P < .0001), or CPE (19, 13-32, P < .0001) and healthy controls (14, 8-20, P < .0001). Dogs with BTB had significantly higher CRP concentrations than dogs with CB (P = .001) or EBP (P < .0001) and healthy controls (P = .029).

However, very little is known about the patterns of respiratory illnesses which affect these people. METHOD: This paper compares Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal age-specific hospitalization patterns for respiratory tract diseases from 1988 to 1993 in Western Australia (WA). RESULTS: Aboriginal people were admitted for respiratory diseases 2-16 times more frequently than non-Aboriginals of the same age with considerable discrepancies in hospitalization rates particularly in infants, young children and older adults. High admission rates for acute respiratory tract infections, pneumonia and asthma occurred in Aboriginal infants. Pneumonia was a disproportionately frequent cause of admissions in Aboriginal infants, children and adults. Pneumonia is a more frequent cause of admission among non-metropolitan compared to metropolitan Aboriginals. Asthma was a frequent cause of admissions of Aboriginal children and hospitalization rates for this disease were higher in non-metropolitan than metropolitan areas. Chronic obstructive airway disease and respiratory tract carcinoma were important uses of hospitalization in older Aboriginals. CONCLUSIONS: Admission rates for respiratory conditions were consistently higher among the Aboriginal population and in non-metropolitan areas. The overwhelming importance of infections among Aboriginal admissions has significant implications for the prevention and management of respiratory diseases among Aboriginal people.",,"['Williams, P', 'Gracey, M', 'Smith, P']","['Williams P', 'Gracey M', 'Smith P']",,"['Health Department of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Asthma/ethnology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander', 'Pneumonia/ethnology', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*ethnology/therapy', 'Western Australia/epidemiology']",,,1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ije/26.4.797 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1997 Aug;26(4):797-805. doi: 10.1093/ije/26.4.797.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It highlighted the importance of early life events on the occurrence of chronic respiratory diseases later in life and their impact on active and healthy ageing. Epidemiologic evidence was followed by actions that should be taken to prevent and manage chronic respiratory diseases in children. The debate ended by practical, feasible and achievable projects, demonstrating the strength of the political action in the field. Three projects will be initiated from this debate: The first will be a meeting sponsored by the Region Languedoc-Roussillon on the developmental origins of chronic diseases and ageing: from research to policies and value creation.

Recurrent cough, often observed after exercise, is the most commonly reported symptom in athletes, particularly winter athletes, but it does not predict airway function; its intensity correlates with the dryness of inspired air but may not be associated with airway hyper-responsiveness. Rhinitis, either allergic or not, is highly prevalent in athletes, particularly non-allergic rhinitis in swimmers. Finally, dysfunctional breathing, including vocal cord dysfunction, may mimic or accompany asthma in a significant number of athletes. These conditions should be recognised and treated properly according to current guidelines, although how these last apply in the athlete is uncertain.

Fourteen client-owned dogs with respiratory diseases were enrolled. Respiratory mechanics, including static compliance (C(stat)) and static resistance (R(stat)), were determined before and after TOTW. Pre- and post-wash results were compared, with a P-value of < 0.05 considered significant. The mean +/- standard deviation (SD) value of C(stat) pre-TOTW was 1.59 +/- 0.94 mL/cmH(2)O/kg while the mean +/- SD of C(stat) post-TOTW was 1.29 +/- 0.71 mL/cmH(2)O/kg (P = 0.045). The median R(stat) was not significantly different pre- and post-wash. The transoral tracheal wash altered respiratory mechanics, as observed by a reduction in C(stat), presumably due to airway flooding and collapse. While no long-lasting effects were noted in these clinical patients, this effect should be considered when performing TOTW on dogs with respiratory diseases.

METHODS:  The prevalence of respiratory disease in captive European orangutans (201 animals; 20 zoos) and possible predisposing factors were investigated. RESULTS: Bornean orangutans (P. pygmaeus) showed chronic respiratory signs significantly more often (13.8%) than Sumatran (P. abelii; 3.6%), and males (15.8%) were more often afflicted than females (3.9%). Hand-reared animals (21%) developed air sacculitis more often than parent-reared animals (5%). Diseased animals were more often genetically related to animals with respiratory diseases (93%) than to healthy animals (54%). None of the environmental conditions investigated had a significant effect on disease prevalence. CONCLUSION: Results suggest a higher importance of individual factors for the development of URTD than environmental conditions.

However, there is increasing evidence indicating an association between occupational exposure and other more prevalent respiratory diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and lung cancer. The effect of contamination is also observed outside the workplace. The air in cities can contribute to increasing the morbidity and mortality due to chronic respiratory diseases.

Wind players may be seriously impaired by respiratory diseases that, comparatively, might appear trivial to the nonperformer. The workplace environment should be assessed for occupational hazards when managing these patients, and smoking should be particularly discouraged. Controversy exists implicating wind instrument use in the exacerbation of respiratory disease, including bronchial, laryngeal, pharyngeal, and oral anatomic changes--a result of the constant barotrauma of performance.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: An ecological study is performed, in which the dependent variable analysed was the number of paediatric consultations in an urban Primary Health Care centre in Madrid over a 3 year period (2013-2015), and specifically the consultations related to bronchiolitis, recurrent bronchospasm, and upper respiratory diseases. The independent variables analysed were the levels of environmental pollutants. Coefficients of correlation and multiple lineal regressions were calculated. An analysis has been carried out comparing the average of paediatric consultations when the levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) were higher and lower than 40mug/m(3.) RESULTS: During the period of the study, there were a total of 52,322 paediatric consultations in the health centre, of which 6,473 (12.37%) were related to respiratory diseases. A positive correlation was found between SO(2), CO, NOx and NO(2) and benzene levels and paediatric consultations related to respiratory diseases, and a negative correlation with temperature. The number of consultations was significantly higher when NO(2) levels exceeded 40mug/m(3). In the multiple lineal regression (P=.0001), the correlation was only positive between consultations and NO(2) levels (3.630, 95% CI: 0.691-6.570), and negative with temperature (-5,957, 95% CI: -8.665 to -3.248). CONCLUSIONS: NO(2) environmental pollution is related to an increase in respiratory diseases in children. Paediatricians should contribute to promote an improvement in urban air quality as a significant preventive measure.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Asociacion Espanola de Pediatria.

METHODS: All notifications received for non asbestos related occupational respiratory disease were reviewed to evaluate the outcome of the notification and to identify the causative agent where possible. RESULTS: There were 277 cases notified and investigated including worksite investigations. Of these 73 cases were confirmed as having occupational asthma, 35 by the asthma validation panel. Nineteen cases of other occupational respiratory disease were notified of which 11 were reviewed by the panel. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis secondary to organic dusts was the most common such notification. CONCLUSIONS: Isocyanates are well recognised as a cause of occupational asthma in New Zealand. It is suspected that occupational asthma and other occupational respiratory diseases are poorly notified to this system. Better mechanisms are needed to identify occupational causes of respiratory (and other) disease.",,"['Walls, C', 'Crane, J', 'Gillies, J', 'Wilsher, M', 'Wong, C']","['Walls C', 'Crane J', 'Gillies J', 'Wilsher M', 'Wong C']",,"['Occupational Safety and Health Service, Department of Labour, Manukau Branch.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,N Z Med J,The New Zealand medical journal,0401067,,IM,"['Asthma/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Disease Notification', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*epidemiology/*etiology']",,,1997/07/11 00:00,1997/07/11 00:01,['1997/07/11 00:00'],"['1997/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,N Z Med J. 1997 Jul 11;110(1047):246-9.,1047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper provides an assessment of the most efficient use of these healthcare resources by reviewing the literature on economic evaluation relating to interventions in the field of respiratory medicine. Currently, this literature largely comprises cost-minimisation studies of both management and educational interventions. Asthma educational interventions, whether targeted at adults or children, appear to be effective in improving patient self-management and adherence to medications, and appear to be associated with a lower overall use of healthcare resources. In terms of management interventions the overall picture is rather less clear although there is some support for the greater efficiency of patient administration of beta-adrenergic agonists by metered dose inhalers over therapist-administered up-draft nebulisation. Two features of respiratory disease make evaluation in this field somewhat unusual: there are alternative methods of delivering therapy to patients, which makes patient compliance an important issue, and since most respiratory diseases are chronic conditions the long-term effectiveness of interventions must be assessed. The scarcity of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility studies in this field may, in part, reflect the difficulties of measuring outcomes in respiratory disease.",,"['Bryan, S', 'Buxton, M J']","['Bryan S', 'Buxton MJ']",,"['Health Economics Research Group, Brunel University, Uxbridge, Middlesex, England.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,,,"['Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Humans', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Respiratory Therapy/*economics', '*Respiratory Tract Diseases/economics/prevention & control/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,1992/08/06 00:00,1992/08/06 00:01,['1992/08/06 00:00'],"['1992/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00019053-199202030-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 1992 Sep;2(3):207-18. doi: 10.2165/00019053-199202030-00004.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The multifactorial character of these relations is confirmed by the fact that only 10% of the patients with gastrooesophageal reflux suffer from respiratory diseases. As these relationships are causal, successful treatment depends on their objectivization. Respiratory manifestations of gastrooesophageal reflux may be a serious and frequently the only symptom of reflux disease. When these causal relationships are not recognized, respiratory symptoms are not adequately treated and they develop gradually into chronic or frequently relapsing disease.

The increase in mortality of asthma was most pronounced in those of greater than 60 years of age (from 11.5 per 100,000 such population in 1979 to 22.9 per 100,000 such population in 1985). Asthma mortality rates in five- to 34-year-old persons increased, although there were marked yearly fluctuations, and deaths of asthma in this age-group comprised only a small percentage (13% in 1985) of all deaths of asthma.

A conclusion was made that in children of both migrant and native Russian parents similar combinations of anthropological traits and gene markers are the factors of their nonspecific resistance to acute respiratory diseases.",,"['Dubrova, Iu E', 'Shenin, V A', 'Sedov, K R']","['Dubrova IuE', 'Shenin VA', 'Sedov KR']",,,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Genetika,Genetika,0047354,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Siberia/epidemiology']",,,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Genetika. 1989 Oct;25(10):1884-91.,10,,,,,,,,,,"Nespetsificheskie nasledstvennye faktory riska ostrykh respiratornykh zabolevanii u detei, prozhivaiushchikh na zapadnom uchastke Baikalo-Amurskoi magistrali.",,,,,,,

It was shown that magnetotherapy produces well-apparent immunocorrective effects in children with the affected upper and lower respiratory tracts including patients with bronchial obstruction syndrome. Positive changes of both cellular and humoral immunity characteristics were documented coupled to the improvement of serum cortisol levels.

AIM: To model the health related economic benefits associated to a reduction in air pollution and the resulting lower prevalence of respiratory diseases, in a Chilean city. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A time series model for year 2006 was elaborated. The dependent variable was the number of consultations for respiratory disease. The independent variables were air pollution expressed as particulate matter of 10 micrometers or less (PM(1)(0)), minimum and maximum environmental temperatures, environmental humidity and number of consultations for chronic diseases. RESULTS: The variables that best explained the number of consultations for respiratory diseases were PM(1)(0), minimal environmental temperatures and preexisting respiratory diseases. In a hypothetical scenery of a 67% reduction in PM(1)(0), 69% of medical consultations for respiratory diseases would be avoided. This would result in a net saving of US$ 345,000 per year.

Macrophages acquire diverse functional phenotypes in response to various microenvironmental stimuli, and are mainly classified into classically activated macrophages (M1) and alternatively activated macrophages (M2). Macrophage polarization participates in the inflammatory, fibrotic, and oncogenic processes of diverse respiratory diseases by changing phenotype and function. In recent decades, with the advent of broad-range profiling methods such as microarrays and next-generation sequencing, the discovery of RNA transcripts that do not encode proteins termed ""noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs)"" has become more easily accessible. As one major member of the regulatory ncRNA family, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs, transcripts >200 nucleotides) participate in multiple pathophysiological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and vary with different stimulants and cell types. Emerging evidence suggests that lncRNAs account for the regulation of macrophage polarization and subsequent effects on respiratory diseases.

However, few studies have investigated the relationship between the ADS and clinic visits for respiratory diseases in children. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the general impact to children's health across space and time by analyzing daily clinic visits for respiratory diseases among preschool and schoolchildren registered in 12 districts of Taipei City during 1997-2007 from the National Health Insurance dataset. METHODS: We applied a structural additive regression model to estimate the association between ADS episodes and children's clinic visits for respiratory diseases, controlling for space and time variations. RESULTS: Compared with weeks before ADS events, the rate of clinic visits during weeks after ADS events increased 2.54% (95% credible interval = 2.43, 2.66) for preschool children (</= 6 years of age) and 5.03% (95% credible interval = 4.87, 5.20) for schoolchildren (7-14 years of age). Spatial heterogeneity in relative rates of clinic visits was also identified. Compared with the mean level of Taipei City, higher relative rates appeared in districts with or near large hospitals and medical centers. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study to assess the impact of ADS on children's respiratory health. Our analysis suggests that children's respiratory health was affected by ADS events across all of Taipei, especially among schoolchildren.",,"['Chien, Lung-Chang', 'Yang, Chiang-Hsing', 'Yu, Hwa-Lung']","['Chien LC', 'Yang CH', 'Yu HL']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Health Behavior Research, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120315,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['0 (Dust)'],IM,"['Child', '*Dust', 'Humans', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",PMC3440078,"['The authors declare they have no actual or potential competing financial', 'interests.']",2012/04/28 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2011/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['ehp.1104417 [pii]', '10.1289/ehp.1104417 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2012 Aug;120(8):1215-20. doi: 10.1289/ehp.1104417.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The aim of the study consists in detecting the prevalence of respiratory diseases in home exposure to secondhand smoke among primary school children. A 6-month prospective case-control study based on questionnaire survey was carried out among school children of ""Spiru Haret"" Primary School, Medgidia, Romania, with absences for respiratory diseases, related to exposure to parental passive smoking, in their home environmental. 136 school children and their families informed, consented to complete the questionnaire and were surveyed for respiratory diseases and domestic environmental tobacco smoking, from the 1st of October, 2011 to the 31st March, 2012. The method consists in collecting data about any respiratory illness events, correlating them with the questionnaire --reports of parental smoking in home environmental. RESULTS: Participants were divided in 88 cases exposed to SHS (E) and 48 controls without exposure (NE). The most sick children with more than one episode of respiratory illness were among cases (n = 61/88; 69.31% vs 19/48; 39.58%; OR = 3.45; RR = 1.62; chi2 = 12.25; p < 0.0008). The most important source of parental passive smoking is the father (n = 67/88; 76.13%), being a single parent in most of the cases (n = 46/88; 57.95%). The prevalence of bronchial asthma was 0.34% in cases, being related with prenatal maternal smoking exposure (1.11%).

Implications for respiratory drug therapy.,207-20,,"The pulmonary system is modified in various ways over time and it is particularly vulnerable to environmental insults. Of particular interest are the implications of aging for therapy of respiratory illnesses. The changes in pulmonary structure and function due simply to aging, and changes due to diseases, should be distinguished from each other. The great reserve function of the lung permits reasonable physical capacity in healthy individuals despite aging changes. In principle, loss of function equivalent to more than one lung is necessary to impair aerobic capacity at any age. Elderly people are subject to the same respiratory diseases as younger adults but may manifest them differently. They may present in atypical ways such as in bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis, and asthma, all modified by anatomical alterations or deterioration of immunological defence mechanisms. Accumulation of toxic substances over time such as cigarette smoke or environmental pollutants may give rise to chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchogenic carcinoma and interstitial lung disease. Changes in the number or function of airway receptors modulate responses to bronchodilator drugs. Chronic inflammation of the bronchial wall has blurred the distinction between traditional asthma and chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and similar drug therapy can be useful for all.

Official data concerning number and cause of deaths, regarding specific respiratory diseases and the total of respiratory diseases, for both Milos Island and the Cyclades Prefecture were used. Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) were computed, adjusted specifically for age, gender and calendar year. Tests of linear trend were performed. By means of a predefined questionnaire, the morbidity rates of specific respiratory diseases in Milos, were compared to those of the municipality of Oinofita, an industrial region. Chi-square analysis was used and the confounding factors of age, gender and smoking were taken into account, by estimating binary logistic regression models. The SMRs for Pneumonia and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) were found elevated for both genders, although they did not reach statistical significance. For the total of respiratory diseases, a statistically significant SMR was identified regarding the decade 1989-1998.

Thirty-five patients with and 27 controls without mineral-dust exposure underwent VFT and HRCT. We recorded all subjects' occupational history for mineral dust exposure and smoking history. Experts independently assessed HRCT using the ICOERD parenchymal abnormalities (Items) grades for well-defined rounded opacities (RO), linear and/or irregular opacities (IR), and emphysema (EM). High-resolution computed tomography showed that 11 patients had RO; 15 patients, IR; and 19 patients, EM. According to the multiple regression model, age and height had significant associations with many indices ventilatory functions such as vital capacity, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). The EM summed grades on the upper, middle, and lower zones of the right and left lungs also had significant associations with FEV1 and the maximum mid-expiratory flow rate.

Because of stress, crowding, and naive immune systems, military training populations are particularly prone to acute respiratory disease epidemics. An examination of the history of respiratory illness at the U.S. Naval Academy revealed that, in the earliest decades at the school, respiratory illness was a primary cause of both disease and mortality. With the advent of antibiotics and vaccines, most respiratory disease mortality has been reduced. However, even today, morbidity remains significant. Health concerns regarding respiratory diseases are heightened by emerging and reemerging respiratory disease agents that have increased antibiotic resistance and/or increased virulence. Enhanced surveillance and rapid diagnostic capabilities, placed in military settings, will increase knowledge of the epidemiology of many respiratory diseases. These strategies can lead to earlier treatment and prevention measures, thus halting the further transmission of disease and decreasing both morbidity and mortality.

AIMS: To describe recently emerging and new cases of WRRD and the relevant methodology using data in a national occupational respiratory disease surveillance scheme in the UK. METHODS: Incident cases of respiratory diseases reported by physicians to the Surveillance of Work-related and Occupational Respiratory Disease (SWORD) between January 2015 and December 2017 were included. Potentially emerging respiratory hazards manifesting in SWORD data were identified with the following hierarchical approach: (i) new respiratory disease not previously associated with work, (ii) specific exposure/agent not previously associated with WRRD and (iii) industry and/or occupation not previously associated with WRRD. RESULTS: A total of 1215 cases of WRRD were reported to SWORD between January 2015 and December 2017. No new WRRD were identified. Thirteen potentially emerging causes of occupational asthma were identified, including exposures to agents such as ninhydrin. Four potential new causes were identified for interstitial pneumonia, which included wood and brass dust. Two potentially emerging causes of WRRD were identified for inhalational accidents (green coffee and nitrocellulose), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (diphenylmethane diisocyanate and salami mould), rhinitis (morphine and Amaranthus quitensis) and sarcoidosis (prions and horses). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous monitoring and reporting of any new work-related disease is a critical function of any occupational disease reporting scheme. Potential emerging causes of work-related health risks have been identified by using a simple and systematic way of detecting emerging causes of WRRDs.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Studies on asthma attributed to FE(NO) an important role in diagnosis and especially in monitoring the effects of anti-inflammatory treatment, which label it as an ""inflammometer"" to be used as a guide in therapy algorithms. Less consistent results were thus far obtained in chronic obstructive lung disease, in which FE(NO) levels seem usually higher than in healthy subjects but lower than in asthma, unless an eosinophil inflammation is present, and in rhinosinusitis, where the levels of nasal NO (nNO) are low, probably because of a reduced NO flow into the nose due to mucosal swelling, while they increase after an effective treatment.

We compared the number of cases of acute cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory diseases in Beijing Emergency Center between 2006 and 2013, with haze data from Beijing Observatory. The relationship between the number of hazy days and the number of cases of the above types of diseases was analyzed using univariate analyses. Both the number of cases and the number of hazy days showed a rising trend. The average number of cases per day for all three diseases was higher on hazy days than on non-hazy days. There was a positive correlation between the number of hazy days and the number of cases, and this correlation showed a hysteretic quality. Haze has an influence on acute cardiovascular (CVDs), cerebrovascular (CBDs), and respiratory system (RSDs) diseases. Haze seems to have an additive effect, since the associations between haze and number of cases were stronger in the following month than in the preceding month.

The use of vaccines is the main approach to control of the economically important poultry viral respiratory diseases infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) infections and infectious bronchitis (IB). This paper appraises the current methods of vaccine control in the light of the nature of each virus and epidemiological factors associated with each disease. 2. Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) exists as a single type with a wide range of disease severity. It is a serious disease in certain regions of the world. Recent work has distinguished molecular differences between vaccine and field strains and vaccine virus can be a cause of disease. Vaccines have remained unaltered for many years but new ones are being developed to counter vaccine side effects and reversion and reactivation of latent virus. 3. Avian metapneumoviruses, the cause of turkey rhinotracheitis and respiratory disease in chickens exists as 4 subtypes, A, B, C and D. A and B are widespread and vaccines work well provided that accurate doses are given. Newer vaccine developments are designed to eliminate reversion and possibly counter the appearance of newer field strains which may break through established vaccine coverage. 4. IB presents the biggest problem of the three. Being an unstable RNA virus, part of the viral genome that codes for the S1 spike gene can undergo mutation and recombination so that important antigenic variants can appear irregularly which may evade existing vaccine protection. While conventional vaccines work well against homologous types, new strategies are needed to counter this instability. Molecular approaches involving tailoring viruses to suit field challenges are in progress. However, the simple use of two genetically different vaccines to protect against a wide range of heterologous types is now a widespread practice that is very effective. 5. None of the three diseases described can claim to be satisfactorily controlled and it remains to be seen whether the newer generations of vaccines will be more efficacious and cost effective. The importance of constant surveillance is emphasised and the testing of novel vaccines cannot be achieved without the use of vaccine-challenge experiments in poultry.",,"['Jones, Richard C']",['Jones RC'],,"['School of Veterinary Science, University of Liverpool, Neston, South Wirral, England, UK. jonesrc@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Br Poult Sci,British poultry science,15740290R,['0 (Viral Vaccines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Herpesvirus 1, Gallid/immunology', 'Infectious bronchitis virus/immunology', 'Metapneumovirus/immunology', 'Poultry', 'Poultry Diseases/epidemiology/immunology/prevention & control/*virology', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/epidemiology/immunology/prevention & control/*veterinary/virology', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology/standards', 'Virus Diseases/epidemiology/immunology/prevention & control/*veterinary/virology']",PMC7154308,,2010/04/15 06:00,2010/07/16 06:00,['2010/04/15 06:00'],"['2010/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['919626724 [pii]', '454601 [pii]', '10.1080/00071660903541378 [doi]']",ppublish,Br Poult Sci. 2010 Feb;51(1):1-11. doi: 10.1080/00071660903541378.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work was conducted to examine the effect of volcanic ash on the chronic respiratory disease mortality in the vicinity of Mt. Sakurajima. METHODS: The present work examined the standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of respiratory diseases during the period 1968-2002 in Sakurajima town and Tarumizu city, where ashfall from the volcano recorded more than 10.000 g/m2/yr on average in the 1980s. RESULTS: The SMR of lung cancer in the Sakurajima-Tarumizu area was 1.61 (95% CI=1.44-1.78) for men and 1.67 (95% CI=1.39-1.95) for women while it was nearly equal to one in Kanoya city, which neighbors Tarumizu city but located at the further position from Mt. Sakurajima, and therefore has much smaller amounts of ashfall. Sakurajima-Tarumizu area had elevated SMRs for COPDs and acute respiratory diseases while Kanoya did not. CONCLUSIONS: Cristobalite is the most likely cause of the increased deaths from those chronic respiratory diseases since smoking is unlikely to explain the increased mortality of respiratory diseases among women since the proportion of smokers in Japanese women is less than 20%, and SPM levels in the Sakurajima-Tarumizu area were not high.

With regard to the multitude of mediators, the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinale polypeptide (VIP) plays a special role as it exerts potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Neurophysiologically the peptide has been attributed to the family of the inhibitory non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (i-NANC) neuromediators of the pulmonary innervation. VIP-containing nerve fibres are localized in the airway and vascular smooth muscle layers of trachea and bronchi in the human respiratory tract. Apart from strong vasodilatory effects, the peptide also shows a high bronchodilatory potency. In a large number of respiratory diseases VIP may play a pathophysiological role. In this respect, increased levels of VIP have been demonstrated for inflammatory diseases of the upper and lower airways and the peptide may also play a role in pulmonary hypertension. Due to its fast enzymatic cleavage, VIP-based therapies have not been used in routine therapy so far. Also, the use of synthetic VIP-agonists did not lead to an improved outcome in patients with bronchial asthma if compared to classical drugs. However, recent data from animal experiments indicate potent immunomodulatory effects which suggest a future use of this mediator and its agonists in the therapy of immune diseases.",,"['Groneberg, D A', 'Rabe, K F', 'Wagner, U', 'Fischer, A']","['Groneberg DA', 'Rabe KF', 'Wagner U', 'Fischer A']",,"['Klinische Forschergruppe Allergologie, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Freie Universitat Berlin and Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, 13353 Berlin. david.groneberg@charite.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Pneumologie,"Pneumologie (Stuttgart, Germany)",8906641,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Respiratory Physiological Phenomena', 'Respiratory System/*physiopathology', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/classification/*physiopathology/therapy', '*Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide']",,,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2004-818352 [doi]'],ppublish,Pneumologie. 2004 May;58(5):330-8. doi: 10.1055/s-2004-818352.,5,,,132,,,,,,,Vasoaktives Intestinales Polypeptid (VIP) im Atemtrakt: Physiologie und Pathophysiologie.,,,,,,,

Areas covered: We searched papers published between 1990 and 2017 dealing with tele-medicine and respiratory diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, interstitial lung disease, chronic respiratory failure, neuromuscular diseases, critical illness, home mechanical ventilation, and also legal and economic issues. Controlled trials report different results on feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and safety of tele-medicine. Expert commentary: Progress in tele-medicine widens the horizons in respiratory medicine: this tool may potentially reduce health care costs by moving some medical interventions from centralized locations in to patient's home, also allowing for the delivery of care in countries with limited access to it.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data on emergency room visits between 1997 and 2001 for respiratory diseases in children less than 17 years old were obtained from hospitals in the Juarez City belonging to the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS). Diseases were classified into three groups according to ICD 9th and 10th codes: a) upper respiratory diseases, b) lower respiratory diseases, and c) asthma attacks. This information was stratified by age group (< = 5 years and > 5 years). Daily air pollution data (ozone and PM10) and weather conditions were obtained from the Monitoring Network System in Juarez City. Statistical analysis was carried out using a Generalized Additive Model assuming a Poisson distribution. RESULTS: Ozone concentrations, but not PM 10, were statistically associated with emergency room visits for respiratory diseases, mainly among children 5 years old or younger. In this group, an increase of 20 ppb 1-hr maximum for ozone was associated with an increase of 8.3% in the number of emergency room visits for upper respiratory diseases, with a 3-day exposure lag; and an increase of 12.7% in the number of emergency room visits for lower respiratory diseases when considering a 4-day exposure lag in a maximum 8-hr mobile average. The largest effect for the complete sample and for the group 6 to 16 years of age was observed for 3-day lag (5.1% for an increase of 20 ppb 1-hr maximum for ozone). For the 6 to 16 year old group we did not find a significant effect. CONCLUSION: The wide range of risk is quite important and might represent a substantial cost for the health system as well as for the society. Our results emphasize the need to implement preventive and control measures for air pollution and avoid the worsening of the present situation.",,"['Hernandez-Cadena, Leticia', 'Barraza-Villarreal, Albino', 'Ramirez-Aguilar, Matiana', 'Moreno-Macias, Hortencia', 'Miller, Paul', 'Carbajal-Arroyo, Luz Aurora', 'Romieu, Isabelle']","['Hernandez-Cadena L', 'Barraza-Villarreal A', 'Ramirez-Aguilar M', 'Moreno-Macias H', 'Miller P', 'Carbajal-Arroyo LA', 'Romieu I']",,"['Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico. lhcadena@correo.insp.mx']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Mexico,Salud Publica Mex,Salud publica de Mexico,0404371,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Air Pollution/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Mexico', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Urban Population']",,,2007/03/29 09:00,2007/06/30 09:00,['2007/03/29 09:00'],"['2007/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0036-36342007000100005 [pii]', '10.1590/s0036-36342007000100005 [doi]']",ppublish,Salud Publica Mex. 2007 Jan-Feb;49(1):27-36. doi: 10.1590/s0036-36342007000100005.,1,,,,,,,,,,"Morbilidad infantil por causas respiratorias y su relacion con la contaminacion atmosferica en Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico.",,,,,,,

The survey was carried out in 5 primary care units in Chorzow where the morbidity data on the selected respiratory diseases were collected from 1 November 1992 to 31 March 1993. The air pollution data were obtained from the monitoring station, being a part of the Sanitary and Epidemiological Station Network. Regression analysis with mean values of concentrations of air pollutants as explanatory variables revealed a positive effect of combined suspended particulate matter and SO2 concentration on the increased prevalence of bronchitis and bronchiolitis. Similar and even stronger effect was observed at the level of temporal variability coefficients of the air pollutants. A hypothesis that temporal variability of the air concentration of pollutants might be a more relevant factor for determining the prevalence of respiratory diseases than simple mean values of the pollutant concentrations is very interesting worthy of further investigations.",,"['Biesiada, M', 'Zejda, J E', 'Skiba, M']","['Biesiada M', 'Zejda JE', 'Skiba M']",,"['Department of Epidemiology, Institute of Occupational Medicine and Environmental Health, Sosnowiec, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Poland,Int J Occup Med Environ Health,International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,9437093,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Air Pollution/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Seasons']",,,2000/09/01 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/09/01 11:00'],"['2000/09/01 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/01 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2000;13(2):113-20.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is also evidence that exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage and infectious diseases of the respiratory tract in horses have a genetic component. The clinical expression of equine respiratory diseases with a genetic basis results from complex interactions between the environment and the genetic make-up of each individual horse. The genetic effects are likely to be due to variations in several genes, i.e. they are polygenic. It is therefore unlikely that single gene tests will be diagnostically useful in these disorders. Genetic profiling panels, combining several genetic factors with an assessment of environmental risk factors, may have greater value, but much work is still needed to uncover diagnostically useful genetic markers or even causative variants for equine respiratory diseases. Nonetheless, chromosomal regions associated with guttural pouch tympany, recurrent laryngeal neuropathy and RAO have been identified. The association of RAO with other hypersensitivities and with resistance to intestinal parasites requires further study.

In the first 5 years of the program (1990-1994), a reduction in annual mortality from pneumonia from 3.0 to 1.7 per 1,000 was observed among children under the age of one year, which contributed to a decline in infant mortality from 13.5 to 8.9 deaths per 1,000 live births.

In order to reduce pathogenesis, iron levels are tightly controlled in throughout the body by regulatory systems that control iron absorption, systemic transport and cellular uptake and storage. Altered iron levels and/or dysregulated homeostasis have been associated with several lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and asthma. However, the mechanisms that underpin these associations and whether iron plays a key role in the pathogenesis of lung disease are yet to be fully elucidated. Furthermore, in order to survive and replicate, pathogenic micro-organisms have evolved strategies to source host iron, including freeing iron from cells and proteins that store and transport iron. To counter these microbial strategies, mammals have evolved immune-mediated defence mechanisms that reduce iron availability to pathogens. This interplay between iron, infection and immunity has important ramifications for the pathogenesis and management of human respiratory infections and diseases. An increased understanding of the role that iron plays in the pathogenesis of lung disease and respiratory infections may help inform novel therapeutic strategies.

Analysis of the breath condensate, the liquid that can be collected by breathing into a cold tube, has been proposed to bring closer to the understanding of airway pathologies. It has been assumed, that (1) airway lining fluid was a stable body liquid and (2) the breath condensate samples were representative of the airway lining fluid. Research was focussed on the identification of biomarkers indicative of respiratory pathologies. Despite 30 years of extended investigations breath condensate analysis has not gained any clinical implementation so far. The pH of the condensate is the characteristic that can be determined with the highest reproducibility. The present paper shows, that contrary to the initial assumptions, breath condensate is not a representative of the airway lining fluid, and the airway lining fluid is not a stable body liquid. Condensate pH shows baseline variability and it is influenced by drinking and by the ambient temperature. The changes in condensate pH are linked to changes in airway lining fluid pH. The variability of airway lining fluid pH may explain seasonal incidence of certain non-allergic respiratory diseases such as the catching of a common cold and the increased incidence of COPD exacerbations and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in cold periods.",,"['Kullmann, Tamas', 'Szipocs, Annamaria']","['Kullmann T', 'Szipocs A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8324-1971'],"['Department of Oncoradiology, Petz Aladar County Teaching Hospital, Vasvari Pal u. 2-4, Gyor, 9024, Hungary. kullmanndoki@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Pulmonology, Petz Aladar County Teaching Hospital, Gyor, Hungary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170705,United States,Int J Biometeorol,International journal of biometeorology,0374716,,IM,"['*Breath Tests', 'Humans', '*Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Incidence', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/epidemiology/*metabolism', 'Seasons']",,,2017/07/06 06:00,2018/09/08 06:00,['2017/07/06 06:00'],"['2016/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/07/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00484-017-1397-y [pii]', '10.1007/s00484-017-1397-y [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biometeorol. 2017 Sep;61(9):1703-1708. doi: 10.1007/s00484-017-1397-y.

There is little research in this area. AIMS: To determine the prevalence of respiratory disease and prescriptions among drug misusers. METHODS: This historical cohort study of drug misusers and matched controls analysed routinely collected primary care data. The prevalence of common chronic respiratory diseases, class and number of respiratory medications were examined. RESULTS: The cohort of 18,570 patients (9,285 per group) was mostly male (64%, n=11,890) and aged 31-59 years (76%, n=14,060). After adjusting for age, gender, deprivation and smoking status, the results showed that more drug misusers than controls had a diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (17.1% vs. 10.9%; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46 to 1.77, and 2.4% vs. 0.8%; OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.44, respectively) and were prescribed more chronic respiratory medications: short-acting beta(2)-agonists (16.4% vs. 7.9%; OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.80 to 2.22), long-acting beta(2)-agonists (1% vs. 0.4%; OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.89), and inhaled corticosteroids (10.6% vs. 7.6%; OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.67).

This similarity between the two organs may underlie why dysfunction in one organ may induce illness in the other. For example, smoking is a major risk factor for COPD and IBD and increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease. Probiotics have been defined as ""live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefits on the host."" In model systems probiotics regulate innate and inflammatory immune responses. Commonly used probiotics include lactic acid bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Saccharomyces, and these are often used as dietary supplements to provide a health benefit in gastrointestinal diseases including infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer. In this respect, probiotics probably act as immunomodulatory agents and activators of host defence pathways which suggest that they could influence disease severity and incidence at sites distal to the gut. There is increasing evidence that orally delivered probiotics are able to regulate immune responses in the respiratory system.

We here conducted a multicenter, retrospective study of patients with severe PH associated with respiratory diseases (R-PH) to reveal their demographics, treatment, prognosis and determinants of prognosis. METHODS: From 101 patients with severe R-PH collected by postal survey at the first stage, 70 patients with four major diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), combined pulmonary fibrosis with emphysema (CPFE), interstitial pneumonia associated with connective tissue disease (CTD-IP), interstitial pneumonia (IP)) and normal pulmonary arterial wedge pressure were studied for clinical characteristics, treatment and prognosis. RESULTS: Three-year survival rates were 50% for COPD (n = 18), 35.7% for IP (n = 19) and 68.1% for CTD-IP (n = 20), and the 2-year survival rate for CPFE (n = 13) was only 22.6%. Eighty-one per cent of patients had been treated with pharmacotherapy specific for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Those patients who had received phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5I) displayed significantly better survival from the date of diagnosis than those who had not (3-year survival: 61.8% vs 20.0% P < 0.0001), especially in the IP, CTD-IP and CPFE groups. Multivariate analysis also revealed that treatment with PDE-5I was a positive prognostic factor. CONCLUSIONS: We here demonstrated the dismal prognosis of patients with severe R-PH.

In this article we examine whether the associations were due to preeclampsia or factors leading to preeclampsia. STUDY DESIGN: From 1978 through 2004, we identified 22,264 discordant sib-pairs in Denmark according to prenatal exposure to preeclampsia. Exposed children were compared to their unexposed siblings by using stratified Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for metabolic and respiratory diseases. RESULTS: Exposed children had rather similar risks for metabolic disorders compared to their unexposed siblings. However, when the second child within each sib-pair was exposed, this child had an increased risk for respiratory diseases (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-2.01). CONCLUSION: Factors leading to preeclampsia may shape susceptibility to metabolic or respiratory diseases in the offspring but a programming effect on respiratory diseases induced by preeclampsia cannot be ruled out.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Mosby, Inc.

This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiological profile of respiratory diseases among children at the Rabat Children's Hospital, Morocco. METHODS: We conducted an observational-cross sectional study of all children aged 3 months to 15 years hospitalized for respiratory disease at the Department of Pneumoallergology and Pediatric Infectious Diseases at the Rabat Children's Hospital, Morocco over a one-year period, from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014. RESULTS: Out of 3537 hospitalized patients, 2493 (70.5%) had respiratory disease. Hospitalizations due to asthmatic exacerbation (p < 0.001), acute bronchiolitis (p < 0.001) and laryngeal dyspnoea (p = 0.004) were more frequent among boys, while hospitalizations due to acute pneumonia (p = 0.005), inhalation of a foreign body (p = 0.007) and pertussis (p = 0.020) were frequent among girls. Hospitalizations due to acute pneumonia (p < 0.001), exacerbation of serious viral disease sequelae (p < 0.001) and pertussis (p < 0.001) were more frequent among infants. Hospitalizations due to acute pneumonia (p < 0.001) and pertussis (p = 0.015) were more frequent during the autumn-winter period. CONCLUSION: The causes of hospitalization were dominated by asthmatic exacerbations and acute bronchiolitis, which were more frequent among boys.

DATA SOURCES: The authors searched the PubMed database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez) from the National Library of Medicine for citations from the pediatric and adult literature relevant to pediatric status asthmaticus, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and neonatal respiratory failure. The authors also searched the reference lists of key primary publications and recent review articles, and queried the National Institutes of Health's ClinicalTrials.gov Web site (www.clinicaltrials.gov) to obtain information about ongoing clinical trials for acute lung injury. The authors had knowledge of new publications in the field of respiratory monitoring, which were considered for inclusion in the review. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: The authors reviewed the promising articles and the decision to include any article in the review was based on its potential to inform pediatric intensive care practice or future research. DATA SYNTHESIS: Articles in six categories were selected for inclusion: status asthmaticus, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory monitoring, and neonatal respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: There have been important new developments relevant to the pathogenesis and management of pediatric respiratory diseases. In particular, new insights into the causal pathways of respiratory syncytial virus-induced airways disease can potentially lead to novel therapies. Computed tomography imaging of the injured lung during mechanical ventilation has opened new avenues for future research directed at testing new treatments in acute lung injury subpopulations defined according to lung mechanics.

The Cochrane Collaboration has fostered the development and dissemination of systematic reviews throughout the world. We have identified and summarised The Cochrane systematic reviews of relevance to the paediatric pulmonologist. METHODS: We performed an expert search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using a combination of medical subject headings and free text terms relating to paediatric respiratory disease. RESULTS: The search identified 120 systematic reviews with interventions specific to children with some relevance to pulmonary disease, and 327 reviews with interventions relating to pulmonary disease in adults and children. After pragmatic exclusions, 81 reviews were sorted by disease and 59 of these are discussed in detail. CONCLUSIONS: There are now many systematic reviews that make a positive contribution to paediatric pulmonology. The majority of reviews (69%) found evidence that either confirmed or refuted an accepted practice. The remaining reviews concluded that the evidence for an accepted practice is poor and sometimes wholly absent. Clinicians must be aware that lack of evidence of effect is not the same as evidence of lack of effect. Caution must be exercised before applying the conclusions of systematic reviews based upon adult data to childhood disease.",,"['Semple, Malcolm G', 'Smyth, Rosalind L']","['Semple MG', 'Smyth RL']",,"['Institute of Child Health, University of Liverpool, Alder Hey, Eaton Road, L12 2AP, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Paediatr Respir Rev,Paediatric respiratory reviews,100898941,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Databases, Factual', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology/*therapy']",,,2003/07/26 05:00,2003/10/10 05:00,['2003/07/26 05:00'],"['2003/07/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1526054203000484 [pii]', '10.1016/s1526-0542(03)00048-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Paediatr Respir Rev. 2003 Sep;4(3):250-66. doi: 10.1016/s1526-0542(03)00048-4.,3,,,85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The total number of subjects was 454, and patients with delirium were 43. Various clinical factors were compared between the delirium group and non-delirium group. In the delirium group, there were many elderly patients of 70 years or older. Moreover, there were many patients who had a chronic respiratory disease, patients in which the respiratory diseases were mutually complicated, and patients in whom other diseases combined with the respiratory disease in the delirium group. There were also many patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and patients with an endotracheal intubation or extubation. Based on the results of a multiple logistic regression analysis, for age, ICU accommodation, and endotracheal intubation, the value of the delirium group was more significant than that of the non-delirium group. In half of the patients from the delirium group, delirium developed within 1 week after hospitalization.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the oral liquid preparation of traditional Chinese medicine, Ban Huang, is safe and effective for treating respiratory diseases in cattle. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Acute oral toxicity experiments were conducted in Wistar rats and Kunming mice via oral administration. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the drug against Mycoplasma bovis in vitro with the double dilution method was 500 mg/mL, indicating good sensitivity. The results of laboratory pathogen testing, analysis of clinical symptoms, and analysis of pathological anatomy were combined to diagnose bovine respiratory diseases in 147 Simmental cattle caused by mixed infections of M. bovis, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, and Mannheimia haemolytica. These cattle were randomly divided into three groups: drug treatment group 1 (treated via Tilmicosin injection), drug treatment group 2 (treated with Shuang Huang Lian oral liquid combined with Tilmicosin injection), and drug treatment group 3 (treated with Ban Huang oral liquid combined with Tilmicosin injection). Treatment effects were observed within 7 days. RESULTS: The results showed no toxicity and a maximum tolerated dose greater than 20 g/kg BW. For the 87 cattle in drug-treatment group, the cure rate was 90.80%, whereas the response rate was 94.25%. The cure rate of drug treatment group was increased by 14.13% in comparison with that of drug control group 1 and by 7.47% in comparison with that of drug control group 2 (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that Ban Huang oral liquid is a safe and effective treatment for bovine respiratory diseases, especially for mixed infection caused by M. bovis, bacteria, and viruses.",,"['Li, Bing', 'Zhou, Xu-Zheng', 'Niu, Jian-Rong', 'Wei, Xiao-Juan', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Yang, Ya-Jun', 'Liu, Xi-Wang', 'Cheng, Fu-Sheng', 'Zhang, Ji-Yu']","['Li B', 'Zhou XZ', 'Niu JR', 'Wei XJ', 'Li JY', 'Yang YJ', 'Liu XW', 'Cheng FS', 'Zhang JY']",,"['Key Laboratory of New Animal Drug Project of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmaceutical Development, Ministry of Agriculture, Lanzhou Institute of Husbandry and Pharmaceutical Sciences of CAAS, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of New Animal Drug Project of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmaceutical Development, Ministry of Agriculture, Lanzhou Institute of Husbandry and Pharmaceutical Sciences of CAAS, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of New Animal Drug Project of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmaceutical Development, Ministry of Agriculture, Lanzhou Institute of Husbandry and Pharmaceutical Sciences of CAAS, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of New Animal Drug Project of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmaceutical Development, Ministry of Agriculture, Lanzhou Institute of Husbandry and Pharmaceutical Sciences of CAAS, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of New Animal Drug Project of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmaceutical Development, Ministry of Agriculture, Lanzhou Institute of Husbandry and Pharmaceutical Sciences of CAAS, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of New Animal Drug Project of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmaceutical Development, Ministry of Agriculture, Lanzhou Institute of Husbandry and Pharmaceutical Sciences of CAAS, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of New Animal Drug Project of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmaceutical Development, Ministry of Agriculture, Lanzhou Institute of Husbandry and Pharmaceutical Sciences of CAAS, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of New Animal Drug Project of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmaceutical Development, Ministry of Agriculture, Lanzhou Institute of Husbandry and Pharmaceutical Sciences of CAAS, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of New Animal Drug Project of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmaceutical Development, Ministry of Agriculture, Lanzhou Institute of Husbandry and Pharmaceutical Sciences of CAAS, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170113,Nigeria,Afr J Tradit Complement Altern Med,"African journal of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicines : AJTCAM",101232990,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', 'XL4103X2E3 (tilmicosin)', 'YEF4JXN031 (Tylosin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*drug therapy/microbiology/virology', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Mannheimia haemolytica', 'Mice', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Mycoplasma bovis/*drug effects', '*Phytotherapy', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Respiratory Syncytial Viruses', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*drug therapy/microbiology/veterinary/virology', 'Tylosin/analogs & derivatives']",PMC5446465,,2017/06/03 06:00,2017/08/17 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['AJTCAM-14-47 [pii]', '10.21010/ajtcam.v14i2.6 [doi]']",epublish,Afr J Tradit Complement Altern Med. 2017 Jan 13;14(2):47-59. doi: 10.21010/ajtcam.v14i2.6. eCollection 2017.,2,['NOTNLM'],"['Ban Huang oral liquid', 'Mycoplasma bovis', 'clinical efficacy', 'minimum inhibitory concentration', 'safety']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, respiratory diseases, even in mild forms, are potentially deleterious to any athletic performance. The functional impairment associated with a respiratory condition depends on the degree of severity of the disease and the equestrian discipline involved. Respiratory abnormalities generally result in an increase in respiratory impedance and work of breathing and a reduced level of ventilation that can be detected objectively by deterioration in breathing mechanics and arterial blood gas tensions and/or lactataemia. The overall prevalence of airway diseases is comparatively high in equine athletes and may affect the upper airways, lower airways or both. Diseases of the airways have been associated with a wide variety of anatomical and/or inflammatory conditions. In some instances, the diagnosis is challenging because conditions can be subclinical in horses at rest and become clinically relevant only during exercise. In such cases, an exercise test may be warranted in the evaluation of the patient. The design of the exercise test is critical to inducing the clinical signs of the problem and establishing an accurate diagnosis. Additional diagnostic techniques, such as airway sampling, can be valuable in the diagnosis of subclinical lower airway problems that have the capacity to impair performance. As all these techniques become more widely used in practice, they should inevitably enhance veterinarians' diagnostic capabilities and improve their assessment of treatment effectiveness and the long-term management of equine athletes.",['(c) 2013 EVJ Ltd.'],"['Van Erck-Westergren, E', 'Franklin, S H', 'Bayly, W M']","['Van Erck-Westergren E', 'Franklin SH', 'Bayly WM']",,"['Equine Sports Medicine Practice, Waterloo, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130201,United States,Equine Vet J,Equine veterinary journal,0173320,,IM,"['Animals', 'Horse Diseases/*pathology', 'Horses', 'Physical Conditioning, Animal/*physiology', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/pathology/*veterinary']",,,2013/02/02 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/02/02 06:00'],"['2011/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/evj.12028 [doi]'],ppublish,Equine Vet J. 2013 May;45(3):376-87. doi: 10.1111/evj.12028.

Improvements in survival and quality of life have led to a new situation where patients with rare respiratory diseases want to plan their reproductive lives. The intention of this review is to present the experience accumulated in the field of the reproductive health of these women. In several rare respiratory diseases, a genetic base has been identified. The combination of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, assisted reproduction and molecular biology techniques enable embryos to be studied genetically before being transplanted into the uterus. Therefore, the risk for transmitting a certain disease or chromosome alteration may be avoided in high-risk couples, and prenatal diagnoses may be done by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. As a general rule, contraceptive methods should be personalized by evaluating the general state of female patients as well as their possibilities for pregnancy, complications and the future possibility of lung transplantation. In lymphangioleiomyomatosis and primary pulmonary hypertension, pregnancy is considered a contraindication. In the former, there is a very high risk for pneumothorax and loss of lung function. In the latter, mortality reaches 33%. In cystic fibrosis, it is estimated that each year 4% of patients become pregnant and there is no observed loss in lung function. There are special circumstances in childbirth that should be considered as well as specific anesthesia risks. The present review suggests that the decision about contraceptive methods, pregnancy as a contraindication or conditions for managing a pregnancy should be both individualized and multidisciplinary.","['Copyright (c) 2012 SEPAR.

We aim to quantify the association between plasma vitamin C concentrations as an indicator of high fruit and vegetable consumption and the risk of incident respiratory diseases and associated mortality in a general population. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Nineteen thousand three hundred and fifty-seven men and women aged 40-79 years without prevalent respiratory diseases at the baseline (1993-1997) and participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk study in the United Kingdom were followed through March 2015 for both incidence and mortality from respiratory diseases. RESULTS: There were a total of 3914 incident events and 407 deaths due to any respiratory diseases (excluding lung cancers), 367 incident lung cancers and 280 lung cancer deaths during the follow-up (total person-years >300,000 years). Cox's proportional hazards models showed that persons in the top quartiles of baseline plasma vitamin C concentrations had a 43% lower risk of lung cancer (hazard ratio (HR) 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.41-0.81) than did those in the bottom quartile, independently of potential confounders. The results are similar for any non-cancerous respiratory diseases (HR 0.85; 0.77-0.95), including chronic respiratory diseases (HR 0.81; 0.69-0.96) and pneumonia (HR 0.70; 0.59-0.83). The corresponding values for mortality were 0.54 (0.35-0.81), 0.81 (0.59-1.12), 0.85 (0.44-1.66) and 0.61 (0.37-1.01), respectively. Confining analyses to non-smokers showed 42% and 53% risk reduction of non-smoking-related lung cancer incidence and death. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of vitamin C concentrations as a marker of high fruit and vegetable consumption reduces the risk of cancerous and non-cancerous respiratory illnesses including non-smoking-related cancer incidence and deaths.",,"['Myint, Phyo Kyaw', 'Wilson, Andrew M', 'Clark, Allan B', 'Luben, Robert N', 'Wareham, Nicholas J', 'Khaw, Kay-Tee']","['Myint PK', 'Wilson AM', 'Clark AB', 'Luben RN', 'Wareham NJ', 'Khaw KT']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3852-6158', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5088-6343']","['School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK. phyo.myint@abdn.ac.uk.', 'Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, UK. phyo.myint@abdn.ac.uk.', 'Clinical Gerontology Unit, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. phyo.myint@abdn.ac.uk.', 'Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, UK.', 'Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, UK.', 'Clinical Gerontology Unit, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'MRC Epidemiology Unit, Cambridge, UK.', 'Clinical Gerontology Unit, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190131,England,Eur J Clin Nutr,European journal of clinical nutrition,8804070,['PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Ascorbic Acid/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', '*Respiratory Tract Diseases/blood/epidemiology/mortality', 'Risk Factors']",PMC7340537,['Conflict of interest None for all authors.'],2019/02/02 06:00,2020/09/29 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2018/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41430-019-0393-1 [pii]', '10.1038/s41430-019-0393-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Nutr. 2019 Nov;73(11):1492-1500. doi: 10.1038/s41430-019-0393-1.

The lung is the internal organ most highly exposed to this milieu. Therefore, it has evolved to confront both oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a variety of pollutants, pathogens, and allergens that promote inflammation and can harm the airways to different degrees. Indeed, an excess of ROS, generated intrinsically or from external sources, can imprint direct damage to key structural cell components (nucleic acids, sugars, lipids, and proteins) and indirectly perturb ROS-mediated signaling in lung epithelia, impairing its homeostasis. These early events complemented with efficient recognition of pathogen- or damage-associated recognition patterns by the airway resident cells alert the immune system, which mounts an inflammatory response to remove the hazards, including collateral dead cells and cellular debris, in an attempt to return to homeostatic conditions. Thus, any major or chronic dysregulation of the redox balance, the air-liquid interface, or defects in epithelial proteins impairing mucociliary clearance or other defense systems may lead to airway damage. Here, we review our understanding of the key role of oxidative stress and inflammation in respiratory pathology, and extensively report current and future trends in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory treatments focusing on the following major acute and chronic lung diseases: acute lung injury/respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis.",,"['Checa, Javier', 'Aran, Josep M']","['Checa J', 'Aran JM']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2827-9392'],"[""Immune-Inflammatory Processes and Gene Therapeutics Group, IDIBELL, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, 08908 Barcelona, Spain."", ""Immune-Inflammatory Processes and Gene Therapeutics Group, IDIBELL, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, 08908 Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201207,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use', '*Homeostasis', 'Humans', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Respiratory Mucosa/*metabolism/pathology', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology']",PMC7731288,['The authors report no conflict of interest in this work.'],2020/12/11 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2020/12/10 01:03'],"['2020/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21239317 [pii]', 'ijms-21-09317 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21239317 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 7;21(23):9317. doi: 10.3390/ijms21239317.,23,['NOTNLM'],"['inflammation', 'oxidative stress', 'respiratory diseases', 'therapeutic strategies']",,"['2014S GR 541/Generalitat de Catalunya/', 'PI16/00377/Instituto de Salud Carlos III/']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective of this study was to develop and validate a fuzzy linguistic model for prediction of hospitalization due to respiratory diseases. We constructed a fuzzy model for prediction of hospitalizations due to pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis and asthma second exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in residents of Volta Redonda, RJ, in 2012. The model contains two inputs, PM2.5 and temperature, with three membership functions for each input, and an output with three membership functions for admissions, which were obtained from DATASUS. There were 752 hospitalizations in the period, the average concentration of PM2.5 was 17.1 microg/m3 (SD = 4.4). The model showed a good accuracy with PM2.5, the result was between 90% and 76.5% for lags 1, 2 and 3, a sensitivity of up to 95%. This study provides support for creating executable software with a low investment, along with the use of a portable instrument could allow number of hospital admission due to respiratory diseases and provide support to local health managers.

METHODS METHODS: By using the data of daily incidence of respiratory diseases obtained from Dongzhimen Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2007, and the data of 16 items of meteorological factors (such as the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, etc., including meteorological factors derived) obtained from the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Observatory, mathematical statistical methods were applied to achieve the non-linear correlation analysis, or the correlation test, between the incidence of respiratory diseases and the time-related meteorological factors. RESULTS: The simple correlation coefficients of the relationship between the incidence of respiratory diseases and 9 meteorological elements, including the average values of temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, degree of comfort, precipitation, vapor pressure, low cloud cover, change of vapor pressure, and change of wind speed, were all greater than 0.8286, in which one of the relationship between the incidence of respiratory diseases and the maximum temperature is as high as 0.9670. Statistical tests showed R>Ralpha=0.05 and F>Falpha=0.05. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of respiratory diseases was closely correlated to meteorological factors, such as air temperature, vapor pressure, precipitation, wind speed, etc. To a certain extent, this conclusion confirmed the scientificity and objectivity of the theory of five evolutive phases and six climatic factors (Wu Yun Liu Qi ) in Huang Di Nei Jing (The Yellow Emperor's Canon of Internal Medicine).",,"['Zhang, De-shan', 'He, Juan', 'Gao, Si-hua', 'Hu, Bao-kun', 'Ma, Shi-lei']","['Zhang DS', 'He J', 'Gao SH', 'Hu BK', 'Ma SL']",,"['Beijing Professional Weather Service Observatory, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110809,China,Chin J Integr Med,Chinese journal of integrative medicine,101181180,['0 (Steam)'],IM,"['Air', 'China/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Humidity', 'Incidence', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', '*Meteorological Concepts', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*epidemiology/*etiology', '*Statistics as Topic', 'Steam', 'Time Factors', 'Wind']",,,2011/08/10 06:00,2011/12/28 06:00,['2011/08/10 06:00'],"['2010/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11655-011-0821-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Chin J Integr Med. 2011 Aug;17(8):600-6. doi: 10.1007/s11655-011-0821-0.

The present review describes strategies to enhance the beneficial effects of MSCs, including preconditioning (under hypoxia, oxidative stress, heat shock, serum deprivation, and exposure to inflammatory biological samples) and genetic manipulation. These strategies can variably promote increases in MSC survival rates, by inducing expression of cytoprotective genes, as well as increase MSC potency by improving secretion of reparative factors. Furthermore, these strategies have been demonstrated to enhance the beneficial effects of MSCs in preclinical lung disease models.

As airway inflammation is the hallmark of many respiratory diseases in childhood, noninvasive methods to assess the presence and severity of airway inflammation might be helpful in both diagnosing and monitoring paediatric respiratory diseases. At present, the measurement of fractional exhaled nitric oxide is the only noninvasive method available to assess eosinophilic airway inflammation in clinical practice. We aimed to evaluate whether the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath (EB) and biomarkers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is helpful in diagnosing and monitoring respiratory diseases in children. An extensive literature search was conducted in Medline, Embase and PubMed on the analysis and applications of VOCs in EB and EBC in children. We retrieved 1165 papers, of which nine contained original data on VOCs in EB and 84 on biomarkers in EBC. These were included in this review. We give an overview of the clinical applications in childhood and summarize the methodological issues. Several VOCs in EB and biomarkers in EBC have the potential to distinguish patients from healthy controls and to monitor treatment responses. Lack of standardization of collection methods and analysis techniques hampers the introduction in clinical practice. The measurement of metabolomic profiles may have important advantages over detecting single markers. There is a lack of longitudinal studies and external validation to reveal whether EB and EBC analysis have added value in the diagnostic process and follow-up of children with respiratory diseases. In conclusion, the use of VOCs in EB and biomarkers in EBC as markers of inflammatory airway diseases in children is still a research tool and not validated for clinical use.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['van Mastrigt, E', 'de Jongste, J C', 'Pijnenburg, M W']","['van Mastrigt E', 'de Jongste JC', 'Pijnenburg MW']",,"[""Department of Paediatric Respiratory Medicine, Erasmus University Medical Centre-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Paediatric Respiratory Medicine, Erasmus University Medical Centre-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Paediatric Respiratory Medicine, Erasmus University Medical Centre-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",,England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Volatile Organic Compounds)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', '*Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Exhalation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Metabolomics/methods', '*Play and Playthings', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Volatile Organic Compounds/*chemistry']",,,2014/11/15 06:00,2016/03/25 06:00,['2014/11/15 06:00'],"['2014/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cea.12454 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2015 Jul;45(7):1170-88. doi: 10.1111/cea.12454.,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to the better-studied gut microbiota, the lung microbiota, only considered in recent years, represents a more discreet part of the whole microbiota associated to human hosts. While the vast majority of studies focused on the bacterial component of the microbiota in healthy and pathological conditions, recent works have highlighted the contribution of fungal and viral kingdoms at both digestive and respiratory levels. Moreover, growing evidence indicates the key role of inter-kingdom crosstalks in maintaining host homeostasis and in disease evolution. In fact, the recently emerged GLA concept involves host-microbe as well as microbe-microbe interactions, based both on localized and long-reaching effects. GLA can shape immune responses and interfere with the course of respiratory diseases. In this review, we aim to analyze how the lung and gut microbiota influence each other and may impact on respiratory diseases. Due to the limited knowledge on the human virobiota, we focused on gut and lung bacteriobiota and mycobiota, with a specific attention on inter-kingdom microbial crosstalks which are able to shape local or long-reached host responses within the GLA.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Enaud, Prevel, Ciarlo, Beaufils, Wieers, Guery and Delhaes.']","['Enaud, Raphael', 'Prevel, Renaud', 'Ciarlo, Eleonora', 'Beaufils, Fabien', 'Wieers, Gregoire', 'Guery, Benoit', 'Delhaes, Laurence']","['Enaud R', 'Prevel R', 'Ciarlo E', 'Beaufils F', 'Wieers G', 'Guery B', 'Delhaes L']",,"['CHU de Bordeaux, CRCM Pediatrique, CIC 1401, Bordeaux, France.', 'Univ.

The increase in percent CRD of slaughtered chickens culminated in week 23/1976 amounting 0.64% (Fig 2). The increased total condemnation rate closely corresponds to an increase in CRD (Fig 3).

In these cases, appropriate management of human and technical resources is essential. These are limited and must be mobilised in an optimal and efficient manner. OBJECTIVE: This paper analyses the use of the health emergency service in a city, Jaen, in the south of Spain. The study is focused on the most recurrent case in this service, respiratory diseases. METHODS: Machine Learning algorithms are used in which the input variables are multisource data and the target attribute is the prediction of the number of health emergency demands that will occur for a selected date. Health, social, economic, environmental, and geospatial data related to each of the emergency demands were integrated and related. Linear and nonlinear regression algorithms were used: support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel and generated linear model (GLM), and the nonlinear SVM with Gaussian kernel. RESULTS: Predictive models of emergency demand due to respiratory disseases were generated with am absolute error better than 35 %. CONCLUSIONS: This model helps to make decisions on the efficient sizing of emergency health resources to manage and respond in the shortest possible time to patients with respiratory diseases requiring urgent care in the city of Jaen.",['Copyright (c) 2023 The Author(s).

Lungworms primarily affect 4- to 6-month-old calves, which become febrile and dyspneic, with moist rales. Diagnosis is by fecal examination using the Baermann technic. Proliferative pneumonia usually affects stabled adults, which develop severe dyspnea and tachypnea. Diagnosis is by the history, clinical signs and lung biopsy. Acute bovine pulmonary emphysema is caused by ingestion of large amounts of L-tryptophan in lush pasture. Affected cattle have severe, acute dyspnea, an expiratory grunt and froth around the muzzle. Diagnosis is by the history and clinical signs. Bronchiolitis obliterans narrows the airways of older animals to cause dyspnea. A positive response to corticosteroids aids diagnosis. Anaphylaxis occurs in cattle of all types and ages and is precipitated by various antigens in a type-I hypersensitivity reaction. Use of atropine aids diagnosis. Allergic or hypersensitivity pneumonia is caused by an allergy to insecticides, dead ascarid larvae or the mold, Micropolyspora faeni. Diagnosis is by a history of insect fogger use, finding M faeni in the forage, and typical histologic lesions in lung samples.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of air pollution caused by particulate matter on children's hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases between 2001 and 2005 in the Metropolitan Region of Chile, independently from the environmental presence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). MATERIAL AND METHOD: 72,479 public and private hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases of children under 15 years of age residing in the study region were analyzed using a time-stratified alternating case-control design. The main evaluations were: hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases (J00-J99), pneumonia (J12-J18); asthma (J21.0 - J21.9), and bronchiolitis (J45 - J46). Daily compilation of temperature data, PM10, PM2.5, ozone, respiratory virus (RSV), and environmental humidity. RESULTS: Mean values of PM10 and PM2,5 were 81.5 and 41.2 pg/m3 respec tively. The average temperature was 12.8  degrees C and air humidity 72.6%. An increase of 10 pg/m3 of PM25 with one and two days of lag was associated with an hospitalizations increase due to respiratory diseases close to 2%, this percentage increased to 5% when the exposure was with eight days of lag, reflecting synergism between particulate matter and respiratory viruses (RSV). CONCLUSION: Short air pollution exposure can lead to children's hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases.",,"['Matus C, Patricia', 'Oyarzun G, Manuel']","['Matus C P', 'Oyarzun G M']",,"['Departamento de Salud Publica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Los Andes, Chile.', 'Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Chile.']",['spa'],['Journal Article'],,Chile,Rev Chil Pediatr,Revista chilena de pediatria,0404261,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Particulate Matter)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Air Pollutants/analysis/*toxicity', 'Air Pollution/*adverse effects/analysis/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chile/epidemiology', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects/analysis/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Particulate Matter/analysis/*toxicity', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Factors']",,,2019/05/17 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2019/05/17 06:00'],"['2018/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0370-41062019005000602 [pii]', '10.32641/rchped.v90i2.750 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Chil Pediatr. 2019 Apr;90(2):166-174. doi: 10.32641/rchped.v90i2.750.,2,,,,,,,,,,"Impacto del Material Particulado aereo (MP 2,5 ) sobre las hospitalizaciones por enfermedades respiratorias en ninos: estudio caso-control alterno.",,,,,,,

The aim of our study was a detailed analysis of mold or bacteria-associated occupational respiratory diseases in garbage workers. From 2002 to 2011 four cases of occupational respiratory diseases related to garbage handling were identified in our institute (IPA). Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) was diagnosed in three subjects (cases 1-3, one smoker, two non-smokers), occupational asthma (OA) was diagnosed in one subject (case 4, smoker), but could not be excluded completely in case 2. Cases 1 and 2 worked in composting sites, while cases 3 and 4 worked in packaging recycling plants. Exposure periods were 2-4 years. Molds and actinomycetes were identified as allergens in all cases. Specific IgE antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus were detected exclusively in case 4. Diagnoses of HP were essentially based on symptoms and the detection of specific IgG serum antibodies to molds and actinomycetes. OA was confirmed by bronchial provocation test with Aspergillus fumigatus in case 4. In conclusion, occupational HP and OA due to molds occur rarely in garbage workers. Technical prevention measures are insufficient and the diagnosis of HP is often inconclusive.

This Research Needs Statement from the International Primary Care Respiratory Group (IPCRG) aims to highlight unanswered questions on the management of respiratory diseases that are of importance to practising primary care clinicians. METHODS: An informal but inclusive consultation process was instigated in 2009. Draft statements in asthma, rhinitis, COPD, tobacco dependence, and respiratory infections were circulated widely to IPCRG members, other recognised experts, and representatives from a range of economic and healthcare backgrounds. An iterative process was used to generate, prioritise and refine research questions in each section. RESULTS: Two overarching themes emerged. Firstly, there is a real need for research to be undertaken within primary care, which recruits patients representative of primary care populations, evaluates interventions realistically delivered within primary care, and draws conclusions that will be meaningful to professionals working within primary care. Secondly, international and national guidelines exist, but there is little evidence on the best strategies for implementing recommendations. Disease-specific research questions focus on effective and cost-effective ways to prevent disease, confirm the diagnosis, assess control, manage treatment, and empower selfmanagement. Practical questions about how to deliver this comprehensive agenda in diverse primary care settings are highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: We hope that this Research Needs Statement will be used by clinicians and patients campaigning for answers to relevant questions, by researchers seeking funding to provide answers to these questions, and by funding bodies to enable them to prioritise research agendas.",,"['Pinnock, Hilary', 'Thomas, Mike', 'Tsiligianni, Ioanna', 'Lisspers, Karin', 'Ostrem, Anders', 'Stallberg, Bjorn', 'Yusuf, Osman', 'Ryan, Dermot', 'Buffels, Johan', 'Cals, Jochen W L', 'Chavannes, Niels H', 'Henrichsen, Svein Hoegh', 'Langhammer, Arnulf', 'Latysheva, Elena', 'Lionis, Christos', 'Litt, John', 'van der Molen, Thys', 'Zwar, Nick', 'Williams, Sian']","['Pinnock H', 'Thomas M', 'Tsiligianni I', 'Lisspers K', 'Ostrem A', 'Stallberg B', 'Yusuf O', 'Ryan D', 'Buffels J', 'Cals JW', 'Chavannes NH', 'Henrichsen SH', 'Langhammer A', 'Latysheva E', 'Lionis C', 'Litt J', 'van der Molen T', 'Zwar N', 'Williams S']",,"['Whitstable Medical Practice, Whitstable, Kent, UK. hilary.pinnock@ed.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Prim Care Respir J,Primary care respiratory journal : journal of the General Practice Airways Group,101121543,,IM,"['*Biomedical Research', 'Humans', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*diagnosis/*therapy']",PMC6602279,,2010/06/04 06:00,2010/09/15 06:00,['2010/06/02 06:00'],"['2010/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['pcrj-2010-03-0022 [pii]', '10.4104/pcrj.2010.00021 [doi]']",ppublish,Prim Care Respir J. 2010 Jun;19 Suppl 1(Suppl 1):S1-20. doi: 10.4104/pcrj.2010.00021.,Suppl 1,,,,['PCRCA/08/01/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom'],['Prim Care Respir J. 2010 Dec;19(4):403-4; author reply 404.

Data were analyzed on adults 20 years and older from the National Survey on Access, Utilization, and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines in Brazil (PNAUM), conducted from September 2013 to February 2014. Prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases was 3% (95%CI: 2.7-3.3). Of these individuals, 58.1% (95%CI: 51.8-64.0) had an indication for pharmacological treatment. Of those with indication for treatment, 77.1% (95%CI: 71.0-82.8) were using at least one of the prescribed drugs. Total access to therapy was 91.4% (95%CI: 79.9-96.6), and more than half of individuals with chronic respiratory diseases purchased at least one of the drugs in retail pharmacies (57.3%). The most frequently reported drug class was the association of a corticosteroid plus a long-acting beta-2 agonist in inhalation form, the most common example of which was the association budesonide/formoterol (20.3%; 95%CI: 16.0-25.4).

Based on the closely related hemp industry and preliminary studies from recreational cannabis grow facilities, there is concern for significant respiratory exposures to bioaerosols containing microbial and plant allergens, chemicals such as pesticides, volatile organic compounds, and other irritant gases. Components of the cannabis plant have also recently been identified as allergenic and capable of inducing an immunoglobulin E-mediated response. Accumulating evidence indicates a spectrum of work-related respiratory diseases, particularly asthma and other allergic diseases. Disentangling causal relationships is difficult given the heterogeneity of mixed exposures, diagnostic challenges, and confounding by personal cannabis use.

METHODS: A total of 3316 patients were admitted to our pulmonary inpatient clinic between 2009 and 2011, and 243 of them (aged over 80 years) with acute respiratory disease were included in our study. Data were retrospectively collected, and included demographic features, comorbidities, laboratory findings, length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In total of 243, 144 patients (59.3%) were men and 99 patients (40.7%) were women. The mean age was 84 +/- 3 years. The prevalence of comorbidity was 75.7% (n = 184). The most common comorbid disease in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was congestive heart failure (32.9%), and it was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (49.4%) in patients with pneumonia. The rate of having one comorbidity was 58.2% (n = 107) and 35.3% (n = 65) had two. Approximately half (52.6%) of the in-hospital deaths occurred within the first 48 hours of hospitalization. The number of comorbidities was higher in the deceased patients compared with the living patients (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that the majority of our patients had at least one comorbidity. The first 48 hours of hospitalization was very important, especially for the patients with comorbidities, to determine the need for intensive care unit and prognosis. The coexistence of comorbidities can increase the risk of mortality in the elderly.

Although economic conditions are improving in these countries, health expenditures have not kept pace with the overall economic growth, and health systems remain weak. These already inadequate systems are being further stressed by the epidemiologic transition that is taking place, characterized by a slow decrease in communicable diseases and an increase in noninfectious chronic diseases, resulting in a ""double burden"" of infectious and noninfectious diseases. Respiratory diseases comprise the largest category of illness within this combined burden of disease. Although there are chronic respiratory disease programs of proven effectiveness appropriate for LMICs, implementation has been greatly hampered by the lack of physicians who have special knowledge and skills in addressing the full spectrum of lung diseases. Thus, there is an urgent need to create training programs for specialists in respiratory diseases. Such programs should be developed and conducted by institutions in LMICs and tailored to fit the prevailing circumstances of the country. Existing curriculum blueprints may be used to guide training program development with appropriate modifications. Academic institutions and professional societies in high-income countries may be called upon to provide technical assistance in developing and implementing training programs. In order to better define the burden of respiratory diseases and identify effective interventions, research, moved forward by persons committed and specialized in this area of health, will be essential.",,"['Chakaya, Jeremiah M', 'Carter, E Jane', 'Hopewell, Philip C']","['Chakaya JM', 'Carter EJ', 'Hopewell PC']",,"['1 Kenya Medical Research Institute, Nairobi, Kenya.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Ann Am Thorac Soc,Annals of the American Thoracic Society,101600811,,IM,"['*Developing Countries', 'Fellowships and Scholarships/*methods/statistics & numerical data', '*Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Program Development', 'Pulmonary Medicine/*education', 'Quality Improvement', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Workforce']",,,2015/02/26 06:00,2016/01/30 06:00,['2015/02/26 06:00'],"['2015/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1513/AnnalsATS.201502-071PS [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2015 Apr;12(4):486-90. doi: 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201502-071PS.,4,['NOTNLM'],"['health systems', 'lung disease burden', 'physician training']",,,['Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2015 Apr;12(4):467-8.

Evidence shows that psychosocial counselling and pharmacotherapy are effective smoking cessation methods and are most effective when used together. The first-line drugs licensed to aid smoking cessation (nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline) are effective in patients with COPD. Efforts are underway to improve the efficacy of existing treatments and increase the proportion of smokers who try to quit, and who use treatment when doing so.

Although a number of mediators are involved in this process, it has been demonstrated that leukotrienes can precipitate both. Leukotrienes are formed in eosinophils, mast cells and neutrophils.

Exit interviews were conducted at the baseline and for impact assessment after six months of pilot project by interviewing patients with CRD attending primary health institutions implementing PAL and control institutions. A total of 94 and 100 CRD patients were interviewed at baseline and after six months in the PAL implementing institutions, and 88 and 96 CRD patients were interviewed at the control institutions. Reduction in number of medical consultation, hospital admissions and exacerbations among CRD patients were 5.03, 3.20 and 2.24 times higher in PAL implementing institutions as compared to the control institutions. PAL pilot project in India implemented in an area with a reasonably sound primary health care system has proved that it might be beneficial for the patients with CRD as it reduces frequency of exacerbations, hospital visits and frequency of medical consultations.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Tuberculosis Association of India.

RESULTS: Upper respiratory symptoms were reported by the 28% of traffic policemen assigned to traffic control and by the 11% of administrative workers (p = 0.006). Neither in the 1st control (ORc 1.1; IL 95% 0.6-2.3) nor in the follow-up, did ORL evaluation show any difference between the two groups, after having controlled for smoking habits (Mac Nemar test p > 0.05). The follow up on FEV1 and FVC did not show an accelerated decline in traffic policemen assigned to traffic control as compared to administrative police workers.

Over the last few decades, there has been increasing interest in the automatic analysis of respiratory sounds and electrical impedance tomography (EIT). Nevertheless, no publicly available databases with both respiratory sound and EIT data are available. METHODS: In this work, we have assembled the first open-access bimodal database focusing on the differential diagnosis of respiratory diseases (BRACETS: Bimodal Repository of Auscultation Coupled with Electrical Impedance Thoracic Signals). It includes simultaneous recordings of single and multi-channel respiratory sounds and EIT. Furthermore, we have proposed several machine learning-based baseline systems for automatically classifying respiratory diseases in six distinct evaluation tasks using respiratory sound and EIT (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3). These tasks included classifying respiratory diseases at sample and subject levels. The performance of the classification models was evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation scheme (with subject isolation between folds). RESULTS: The resulting database consists of 1097 respiratory sounds and 795 EIT recordings acquired from 78 adult subjects in two countries (Portugal and Greece). In the task of automatically classifying respiratory diseases, the baseline classification models have achieved the following average balanced accuracy: Task A1 - 77.9+/-13.1%; Task A2 - 51.6+/-9.7%; Task A3 - 38.6+/-13.1%; Task B1 - 90.0+/-22.4%; Task B2 - 61.4+/-11.8%; Task B3 - 50.8+/-10.6%. CONCLUSION: The creation of this database and its public release will aid the research community in developing automated methodologies to assess and monitor respiratory function, and it might serve as a benchmark in the field of digital medicine for managing respiratory diseases. Moreover, it could pave the way for creating multi-modal robust approaches for that same purpose.",['Copyright (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

From 1971 to 1998, mediastinoscopy were performed on 1664 patients admitted to our hospital with respiratory diseases. For the superior mediastinal diseases, mediastinal tumor and lymphadenopathies without cancer, two or three samples were obtained by mediastinoscopy. For lung cancer, biopsy was routinely performed at the 6 nodal stations, right and left paratracheal (#2), right and left tracheobronchial (#4), pretracheal (#3), and subcarinal (#7) lymphnodes. From 1994, we have used video-mediastinoscopy, which was combined with scope and TV-camera. Using video-mediastinoscopy, many staffs could observe the mediastinal findings on TV-monitor during mediastinal manipulation. The positive findings were observed in 17% (221/1299) for lung cancer, 100% (32/32) for sarcoidosis, 100% (2/2) for malignant lymphoma, 65% (11/17) for mediastinal tumor, 9.8% (13/132) for pulmonary tuberculosis. The positive rate according to the histological types of lung cancer were 20.5% (148/721) for adenocarcinoma, 9.4% (39/415) for squamous cell carcinoma, 31.6% (24/76) for small cell carcinoma, 21.3% (10/47) for large cell carcinoma. Complications developed in a total of 3.6%, and these were bronchial arterial damage(1.8%), recurrent nerve paralysis(0.7%), azygos vein damage (0.4%), pleural rupture(0.4%), superior vena cava damage(0.2%) and tracheal laceration(0.1%). However, there were no severe complications and operative deaths in this series. Mediastinoscopy is a minimal invasive and safety surgical procedure that is widely used as a diagnostic method for investigating the superior mediastinum, mediastinal tumor and lymphadenopathies. It is useful for obtaining histological diagnosis, as well as for staging lung cancer.

Lanzhou is located in northwest China, central Gansu Province. Due to limited research and data, the impact of PM on human health have not been systematically acknowledged. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to investigate the association between size-fractionated PM pollution and outpatients visits for RESD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data on outpatient visits for RESD, air pollutants and meteorological indices in Lanzhou were collected from 1 February 2014 - 31 December 2017, and the associations of three types of PM (PM(2.5), PM(C), and PM(10)) with outpatient visits for RESD were evaluated using generalized additive models (GAMs). RESULTS: Findings showed that PM(2.5) and PM(C) had the most significant impact on outpatient visits for RESD at seven cumulative lag days. PM(10) was not significantly associated with outpatient visits for RESD. In subgroup analysis, the impact of atmospheric PM on outpatient visits for RESD was significantly modified by gender and age; men, and children aged 0-5 years old, were more sensitive to PM(2.5) pollution. CONCLUSIONS: Increased atmospheric PM concentration is associated with an increase in outpatient visits for RESD, and it has a lag effect. The increase in outpatient visits for RESD appears to be driven by increased PM(2.5) concentrations. The results obtained may provide reference values for formulating preventive strategies to protect the population from the adverse impact of PM pollution.",,"['Zhai, Guangyu', 'Zhang, Kuan', 'Chai, Guorong']","['Zhai G', 'Zhang K', 'Chai G']",,"['School of Economics and Management, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou 730050, China.', 'School of Economics and Management, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou 730050, China.', 'School of Management, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210121,Poland,Ann Agric Environ Med,Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,9500166,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Particulate Matter)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Air Pollutants/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Air Pollution/adverse effects/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outpatients/statistics & numerical data', 'Particulate Matter/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2021/03/30 06:00,2021/05/05 06:00,['2021/03/29 05:26'],"['2021/03/29 05:26 [entrez]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['132179 [pii]', '10.26444/aaem/132179 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Agric Environ Med. 2021 Mar 18;28(1):131-141. doi: 10.26444/aaem/132179.

Over 1,000 human miRNAs have been discovered to date; however, the biological function and protein targets for the majority remain to be uncovered. Within the respiratory system, miRNAs are important in normal pulmonary development and maintaining lung homeostasis. Recent studies have also begun to reveal that altered miRNA expression profiles may be associated with pathological processes within the lung and lead to the development of various pulmonary diseases, ranging from inflammatory diseases to lung cancers.

RECENT FINDINGS: Climate change involves two major types of change. First, there is overall progressive warming. Second, there is increased variability/unpredictability in weather patterns. Both types of change impact negatively upon human respiratory health. Worsening air quality and increased allergens can worsen existing disease. Climate-related changes in allergens and in vectors for infection can cause new disease. Redundant sophisticated studies have projected marked increases in respiratory morbidity and mortality throughout the world as a direct result of climate change. This article summarizes some of those studies. SUMMARY: The clarity of our vision with respect to the dramatic impact of climate change upon human respiratory health approaches 20/20.

There is also emerging evidence that gut microbiomes play a role in lung diseases through the modulation of systemic immune responses and can be modified by diet and antibiotic treatment. There are issues that are particular to the Asia-Pacific region involving diet and prevalence of specific respiratory diseases. Each of these issues is further complicated by the effects of ageing.

In a percentage of LAR subjects, the upper airway disease is also associated with lower airway symptoms. After the description of this phenotype, the differential diagnosis between LAR and nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) has become a challenge for the clinician. To correctly identify LAR patients is of high importance for treatment and management of these patients, and for an appropriate inclusion of patients in clinical trials and genetics studies. The treatment of LAR patients, in contrast with NAR, is oriented to allergen avoidance and specific treatment. Allergen immunotherapy, the aetiological treatment for allergic respiratory diseases, has demonstrated to be an effective and safe treatment in LAR, increasing immunological tolerance, and reducing the clinical symptoms and the use of medication.

Detrimental effects of ozone (O(3)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and particulate matter (PM), as well as traffic-related pollution as a whole, on respiratory symptoms and function are well documented. Not only do we have strong epidemiological evidence of a relationship between air pollution and exacerbation of asthma and respiratory morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but recent studies, particularly in urban areas, have suggested a role for pollutants in the development of both asthma and COPD. Similarly, while prevalence and severity of atopic conditions appear to be more common in urban compared with rural communities, evidence is emerging that traffic-related pollutants may contribute to the development of allergy. Furthermore, numerous epidemiological and experimental studies suggest an association between exposure to NO(2) , O(3) , PM and combustion products of biomass fuels and an increased susceptibility to and morbidity from respiratory infection. Given the considerable contribution that traffic emissions make to urban air pollution researchers have sought to characterize the relative toxicity of traffic-related PM pollutants. Recent advances in mechanisms implicated in the association of air pollutants and airway disease include epigenetic alteration of genes by combustion-related pollutants and how polymorphisms in genes involved in antioxidant pathways and airway inflammation can modify responses to air pollution exposures. Other interesting epidemiological observations related to increased host susceptibility include a possible link between chronic PM exposure during childhood and vulnerability to COPD in adulthood, and that infants subjected to higher prenatal levels of air pollution may be at greater risk of developing respiratory conditions. While the characterization of pollutant components and sources promise to guide pollution control strategies, the identification of susceptible subpopulations will be necessary if targeted therapy/prevention of pollution-induced respiratory diseases is to be developed.",['(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Kelly, F J', 'Fussell, J C']","['Kelly FJ', 'Fussell JC']",,"[""MRC-HPA Centre for Environment and Health, King's College, London, 150 Stamford Street, London SE1 9NH, UK. frank.kelly@kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110530,England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,['0 (Air Pollutants)'],IM,"['Air Pollutants/adverse effects', 'Air Pollution/*adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology/genetics/physiopathology']",,,2011/06/01 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/06/01 06:00'],"['2011/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2222.2011.03776.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2011 Aug;41(8):1059-71. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2011.03776.x.

METHODS: Daily records of health center attendance due to respiratory diseases among children were obtained from the public health system in Curitiba, State of Parana, Brazil. Daily levels of particulate matter (PM10), smoke, NO2 and O3 were obtained from both Parana State Environmental Institute and the Development Technology Institute, a non-governmental agency. Daily measurements of temperature and relative humidity were obtained from the National Institute of Meteorology. Generalized additive Poisson regression models were used to assess the relationship between respiratory diseases and air pollution, controlling for long-term seasonality using loess (a non-parametric smoothing function), weather and weekdays. A significance level of 5% was adopted in all the analyses. RESULTS: All pollutants presented an effect on respiratory diseases among children. An increase of 40.4 mg/m3 in the 3-day moving average of smoke was associated with an increase of 4.5% (95% CI: 1.5-7.6) in the attendance of children with respiratory diseases. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that air pollution promotes adverse effects on children's respiratory health even when pollutant levels are lower than the air quality standards.",,"['Bakonyi, Sonia Maria Cipriano', 'Danni-Oliveira, Ines Moresco', 'Martins, Lourdes Conceicao', 'Braga, Alfesio Luis Ferreira']","['Bakonyi SM', 'Danni-Oliveira IM', 'Martins LC', 'Braga AL']",,"['Departamento de Geografia, Universidade Federal do Parana (UFPR), Curitiba, PR, Brazil.']",['por'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20041018,Brazil,Rev Saude Publica,Revista de saude publica,0135043,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Air Pollution/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Brazil', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Factors']",,,2004/10/23 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2004/10/23 09:00'],"['2004/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0034-89102004000500012 [pii]', '10.1590/s0034-89102004000500012 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Saude Publica. 2004 Oct;38(5):695-700. doi: 10.1590/s0034-89102004000500012.

Paulo, Brazil, in 1986. Its progress thereafter and the epidemiology of the diseases concerned are examined. Apart from an inquiry into the 64 existing State local health authorities, a sample of 18,255 cases of children assisted by the programme at different levels, including both in-patient and outpatient care, is analysed. Each case record included information about identification (child, doctor and health facility), reasons for calling, diagnoses made and outcome of treatment. Further data were also sought from hospitals and from State mortality records. The programme was found to be poorly implemented in the State but, where implemented, it showed itself capable of resolving problems (only 0.5% of the cases could not be handled) as also of changing ongoing trends (more than 50% reduction in hospital admission rates). Individual assessment of each item of the programme indicated its bottlenecks. Regarding the epidemiology of respiratory diseases, it is observed that the major burden to health services comes from children aged less than five, and that the most important diseases are wheezing illnesses and pneumonia. Moreover, they were found to be significantly associated (p = 0.000) so that a child in the community presenting wheezing diseases is 5 times more likely to develop pneumonia than a child with any other respiratory diagnosis. Similarly, among the under five deaths it was found that the risk for pneumonia is 3 times greater for children who died presenting wheezing diseases than it is for children with any other sort of diagnosis. In conclusion, the programme is deemed to be efficient and effective but its efficacy is marred by administrative flaws. The successful control of respiratory problems in childhood is related to a proper appreciation of the importance of wheezing diseases.",,"['Pereira, J C', 'Stuginsky, L A', 'Ribeiro, T V']","['Pereira JC', 'Stuginsky LA', 'Ribeiro TV']",,"['Instituto Adolfo Lutz-Secretaria de Saude do Estado de Sao Paulo, Brasil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Rev Saude Publica,Revista de saude publica,0135043,,IM,"['Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', 'Program Evaluation', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/epidemiology/*prevention & control']",,,1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0034-89101992000600007 [pii]', '10.1590/s0034-89101992000600007 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Saude Publica. 1992 Dec;26(6):414-23. doi: 10.1590/s0034-89101992000600007.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Twain Shall Meet.,1053-1061,,"Respiratory diseases are highly complex, being driven by host-environment interactions and manifested by inflammatory, structural, and functional abnormalities that vary over time. Traditional reductionist approaches have contributed vastly to our knowledge of biological systems in health and disease to date; however, they are insufficient to provide an understanding of the behavior of the system as a whole. In this Pulmonary Perspective, we discuss systems biology approaches, especially but not limited to the study of the lung as a complex system. Such integrative approaches take into account the large number of dynamic subunits and their interactions found in biological systems. Borrowing methods from physics and mathematics, it is possible to study the collective behavior of these systems over time and in a multidimensional manner. We first examine the physiological basis for complexity in the respiratory system and its implications for disease. We then expand on the potential applications of systems biology methods to study complex systems, within the context of diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and critical illness. We summarize the significant advances made in recent years using systems approaches for disease phenotyping, applied to data ranging from the molecular to clinical level, obtained from large-scale asthma and COPD networks. We describe new studies using temporal complexity patterns to characterize asthma and COPD and predict exacerbations as well as predict adverse outcomes in critical care.

The bronchial lesions are inflammatory and can be reversed by corticosteroid therapy. Bronchiectasis produces similar symptoms, but has distinctive radiological features.

The certificates from each country were coded firstly by their own offices and subsequently by the W.H.O. Reference Centre in the U.K. Large within- and between-country differences in the coded causes of death were found. Some of these differences were due to variations in the ways doctors certify deaths, others to the way certificates are coded in each country.

The study group consisted of 299 adults (median age: 65, min-max: 18-92 years) with mixed chronic respiratory diseases, recruited from patients of 135 general practitioners. In the analysis, in addition to the assessment of the provided medical services, the following were used: Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire, Camberwell Assessment of Needs Short Appraisal Schedule, Acceptance of Illness Scale, and WHO Quality of Life Instrument Short Form. Variables that determined the level of services were the following: age, place of residence, marital status, number of chronic diseases, and level of disease acceptance, quality of life, and health behaviors. The level of provided services correlated with variables such as gender, severity of somatic symptoms, level of satisfied needs, and satisfaction with health care. We concluded that in patients with mixed chronic respiratory diseases a higher level of health care utilization should be expected in younger patients, those living in the countryside, those having a partner, with multimorbidity, a low level of disease acceptance, those satisfied with their current quality of life, with positive mental attitudes, and maintaining health practices.",,"['Kurpas, D', 'Bujnowska-Fedak, M M', 'Athanasiadou, A', 'Mroczek, B']","['Kurpas D', 'Bujnowska-Fedak MM', 'Athanasiadou A', 'Mroczek B']",,"['Department of Family Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, 1 Syrokomli St., 51-141, Wroclaw, Poland, dkurpas@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Body Mass Index', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Primary Health Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Quality of Life', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/psychology/*therapy']",,,2015/05/30 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/05/30 06:00'],"['2015/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/5584_2015_141 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2015;866:71-81. doi: 10.1007/5584_2015_141.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no study has comprehensively validated the accuracy of Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) data on various respiratory diseases. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the validity of diagnoses of respiratory diseases in the DPC database. METHODS: We conducted chart reviews of 400 patients hospitalized in the departments of respiratory medicine in two acute-care hospitals in Tokyo, between April 1, 2019 and March 31, 2021, and used them as reference standards. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of DPC data on 25 respiratory diseases were determined. RESULTS: Sensitivity ranged from 22.2% (aspiration pneumonia) to 100% (chronic eosinophilic pneumonia and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and was <50% for eight diseases, while specificity was >90% for all diseases. PPV ranged from 40.0% (aspiration pneumonia) to 100% (coronavirus disease 2019, bronchiectasis, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, pulmonary hypertension, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, lung cancer of other histological types, and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and was >80% for 16 diseases. Except for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (82.9%) and interstitial pneumonia (other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) (85.4%), NPV was >90% for all diseases. These validity indices were similar in both hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: The validity of diagnoses of respiratory diseases in the DPC database was high in general, thereby providing an important basis for future studies.","['Copyright (c) 2023 The Japanese Respiratory Society.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate patient's viewpoint about the different aspects involved in their respiratory diseases. METHODS: This is a prospective observational survey. 46 Italian medical centres were involved and equally distributed. The interviews were carried out and were performed by means of a questionnaire which consisted of 32 questions regarding lung disease, modality of access to medical facilities, therapy and level of medical assistance. RESULTS: 1116 patients were enrolled and the most important respiratory symptoms referred were: dyspnoea (69%), chronic phlegm (28%), cough (13%). During programmed visits 98.3% and 98.8% of interviewed patients knew were aware of asthma and COPD respectively, percentage that dropped, during emergency accesses, to 1.7% and 1.1% knew to have asthma and COPD respectively. Primarily were prescribed 1.67 spirometry/patient/year while only the 2% of patients referred to have performed a blood gas analysis. The 18% of patients spontaneously discontinued the therapy, considering it too complex. The average time that patients identified as being used by the doctor to perform the visit was of 22 minutes, with an high mean medical assistance satisfaction score. DISCUSSION: There has been little research examining what factors may influence patient acceptance and participation of chronic respiratory diseases. Our national survey demonstrated that a good patient-physician relationship represents one of the first points in the successful management of respiratory diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2012 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

METHODS: Six hundred and thirty late preterm infant(gestational age: 34~36+6weeks),4401 cases of term infants and 328 early preterm infants who were born at the obstetrical department of Peking University 3rd Hospital from January 2009 to December 2010 were enrolled. Among them 84 late preterm infants, 135 term infants and 182 early preterm infants developed respiratory diseases. The incidence of respiratory diseases,clinical features and the severity of the diseases were compared among the three groups. RESULTS: The incidence and mortality rates of respiratory diseases and the percentage of severe cases were significantly higher in the late preterm group than in the term group, but lower than in the early preterm group (P<0.01). The symptoms of respiratory disease occurred earlier in the late preterm group than in the term group, but later than in the early preterm group (P<0.01). The late preterm group had a significantly higher incidence of tachypnea and lower incidence of retraction sign when compared with the term and early preterm groups (P<0.05). The percentages requiring oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation in the late preterm group were both significantly higher than in the term group, but lower than in the early preterm group (P<0.05). The multiple linear regression analysis showed 11 factors associated with the severity of respiratory diseases: decreased arterial partial pressure of oxygen, hematokrit, pH value and respiratory rate, arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation, systolic arterial pressure, 5 minute Apgar score and gestational age, and increased blood urea nitrogen, heart rate and respiratory rate. CONCLUSIONS: Late preterm infants are more likely to develop respiratory diseases than term infants, and to develop a more severe condition and need a more intensive respiratory support treatment. Tachypnea is a common presentation of dyspnea in late preterm infants and occurs earlier than in term infants but later than in early preterm infants. It may usually indicate a serious condition when dyspnea, abnormal heart rate and blood pressure, and multisystem damages occur in late preterm infants.",,"['Cui, Yun-Pu', 'Tong, Xiao-Mei', 'Han, Tong-Yan', 'Tang, Ya-Nan']","['Cui YP', 'Tong XM', 'Han TY', 'Tang YN']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,,IM,"['Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature, Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/05/16 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['1008-8830(2012)01-0015-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2012 Jan;14(1):15-9.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The string '(((pulmonary) OR respiratory)) AND ((artificial intelligence) OR machine learning)' was used in PubMed as a search strategy. The majority of studies identified corresponded to the area of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in particular to COPD and chest computed tomography scans, interpretation of pulmonary function tests, exacerbations and treatment. Another field of interest is the application of AI and ML to the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease, and a few other studies were identified on the fields of mechanical ventilation, interpretation of images on chest X-ray and diagnosis of bronchial asthma.Expert opinion: ML may help to make clinical decisions but will not replace the physician completely. Human errors in medicine are associated with large financial losses, and many of them could be prevented with the help of AI and ML.

TGF-beta overexpression in chronic inflammation, remodeling, fibrotic process and susceptibility to viral infection is established in the most prevalent chronic respiratory diseases including asthma, COPD, lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Despite the overwhelming burden of respiratory diseases in the world, new pharmacological therapies have been limited in impact. Although TGF-beta inhibition as a therapeutic strategy carries great expectations, the constraints in avoiding compromising the beneficial pleiotropic effects of TGF-beta, including the anti-proliferative and immune suppressive effects, have limited the development of effective pharmacological modulators. In this review, we focus on the pathways subserving deleterious and beneficial TGF-beta effects to identify strategies for selective modulation of more distal signaling pathways that may result in agents with improved safety/efficacy profiles. Adverse effects of TGF-beta inhibitors in respiratory clinical trials are comprehensively reviewed, including those of the marketed TGF-beta modulators, pirfenidone and nintedanib. Precise modulation of TGF-beta signaling may result in new safer therapies for chronic respiratory diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

DESIGN: Retrospective review of medical records in a stratified sample of 836 patients drawn from a total of 4,555 hospital admissions registered during the year 2001. SETTING: A referral tertiary-care hospital for patients with respiratory diseases located in Mexico City. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weighted prevalence of AEs and odds ratios for correlates. RESULTS: The overall weighted prevalence for AEs was 9.1% (95% confidence interval, 7.5 to 10.4%). Of these patients, 17% had a related transient disability, 52% had a prolonged hospital stay, and 26% had an AE that according to the reviewers contributed to their death. Of the total number of AEs, 74% were qualified as potentially preventable. Among all types of AEs, we identified as most relevant for a chest hospital the delayed surgical treatment of empyema, representing 11% of the total.

Therefore, it is important to conduct surveillance to monitor ORDs, particularly in developing countries, where the working population is especially vulnerable and the health system infrastructure is usually weak. This article provides a general framework for the implementation of ORD surveillance in developing countries. The main objectives of surveillance are to describe incidence and prevalence of ORDs, as well as to identify sentinel events and new associations between occupational exposures and health outcomes. Diseases with high morbidity and mortality and those in which early diagnosis with standardized tests are available are especially suitable for surveillance activities. Simple strategies, preferably using existing resources and technology, are the best option for surveillance in developing countries.

Sinusitis was divided into three groups. The first group was sinusitis with bronchial asthma. The second group was sinusitis with chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis or diffuse panbronchiolitis. This type of sinusitis is generally called sinobronchial syndrome (SBS). The third group was sinusitis without lower respiratory tract disease. Because the pathogenesis of these lower respiratory tract diseases differs with the diseases, the pathogenesis of sinusitis accompanied by these lower respiratory tract diseases also may be different. Clinical and laboratory examinations used in this study were rhinoscopy, X-ray examination of the paranasal sinuses, cytological study of nasal secretion and the saccharin test for the muco-ciliary function of the nasal mucosa. By rhinoscopic examination, no difference was found in the size of the nasal polyp among three groups. The results of other examinations were as follows. X-ray examination: Involvement of the ethmoid sinuses was greater than that of the maxillary sinuses in the patients with sinusitis with bronchial asthma. In contrast, involvement of the maxillary sinuses in SBS patients was greater than that of the ethmoid sinuses. Cytology of nasal secretion: Dominant inflammatory cells in the patients with sinusitis with bronchial asthma were eosinophils, while neutrophil were more frequently found in the SBS patients. Saccharin test: Most of the patients with bronchial asthma showed normal responses. In the SBS patients, however, only a few patients showed a normal response and the others showed prolonged responses. Clinical characteristics of the patients with sinusitis without lower respiratory diseases were more similar to those of the SBS patients. In conclusion, there were distinct differences in these clinical characteristics between sinusitis with bronchial asthma and SBS. These results suggest that the pathogenesis or the inflammatory process of sinusitis is heterogeneous and whether the inflammation is allergic or not may be important.",,"['Ishitoya, J', 'Oguchi, N', 'Wang, N Y', 'Toriyama, M', 'Kudo, K']","['Ishitoya J', 'Oguchi N', 'Wang NY', 'Toriyama M', 'Kudo K']",,"['Department of Otolaryngology, International Medical Center of Japan, Tokyo.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai Kaiho,Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai kaiho,7505728,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Asthma/complications', 'Bronchial Diseases/complications', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*complications', 'Sinusitis/*complications']",,,1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3950/jibiinkoka.99.675 [doi]'],ppublish,Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai Kaiho. 1996 May;99(5):675-80. doi: 10.3950/jibiinkoka.99.675.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further large-scale studies in several regions worldwide are needed to support the literature to date and encourage national governments to act. Brazil is an example of these regions where little research has been performed on a large scale. To address this gap, we conducted a study looking at the relationship between daily PM(2.5), NO(2), and O(3), and hospital admissions for circulatory and respiratory diseases across Brazil between 2008 and 2018. A time-series analytic approach was applied with a distributed lag modeling framework. We used a generalized conditional quasi-Poisson regression model to estimate relative risks (RRs) of the association of each air pollutant with the hospitalization for circulatory and respiratory diseases by sex, age group, and Brazilian regions. Our study population includes 23, 791, 093 hospital admissions for cardiorespiratory diseases in Brazil between 2008 and 2018. Among those, 53.1% are respiratory diseases, and 46.9% are circulatory diseases. Our findings suggest significant associations of ambient air pollution (PM(2.5), NO(2), and O(3)) with respiratory and circulatory hospital admissions in Brazil. The national meta-analysis for the whole population showed that for every increase of PM(2.5) by 10 mug/m(3), there is a 3.28% (95%CI: 2.61; 3.94) increase in the risk of hospital admission for respiratory diseases. For O(3), we found positive associations only for some sub-group analyses by age and sex. For NO(2), our findings suggest that a 10 ppb increase in this pollutant, there was a 35.26% (95%CI: 24.07; 46.44) increase in the risk of hospital admission for respiratory diseases.

Accurately assessing airway sounds requires extensive clinical training and equipment that may not be easily available. Current methods that automate this diagnosis are hindered by their use of features that require pulmonary function tests. We leverage the audio characteristics of coughs to create classifiers that can distinguish common respiratory diseases in adults. Moreover, we build on recent advances in generative adversarial networks to augment our dataset with cleverly engineered synthetic cough samples for each class of major respiratory disease, to balance and increase our dataset size. We experimented on cough samples collected with a smartphone from 45 subjects in a clinic. Our CoughGAN-improved Support Vector Machine and Random Forest models show up to 76% test accuracy and 83% F1 score in classifying subjects' conditions between healthy and three major respiratory diseases. Adding our synthetic coughs improves the performance we can obtain from a relatively small unbalanced healthcare dataset by boosting the accuracy over 30%.

Our aim was to analyze the impact of the pandemic on primary care new diagnoses of respiratory diseases. METHODS: Observational retrospective study performed to describe the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of respiratory diseases according to primary care codification. Incidence rate ratio between pre-pandemic and pandemic period was calculated. RESULTS: We found a decrease in the incidence of respiratory conditions (IRR 0.65) during the pandemic period. When we compared the different groups of diseases according to ICD-10, we found a significant decrease in the number of new cases during the pandemic period, except in the case of pulmonary tuberculosis, abscesses or necrosis of the lungs and other respiratory complications (J95). Instead, we found increases in flu and pneumonia (IRR 2.17) and respiratory interstitial diseases (IRR 1.41). CONCLUSION: There has been a decrease in new diagnosis of most respiratory diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.","['Copyright (c) 2023 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

A previous comprehensive survey, sponsored by the EPA, of all U.S. counties used multiple regression analysis as a method of statistical surveillance to assess the association of mortality with industrial activity. This preliminary study suggested an excess mortality from nonmalignant respiratory diseases in copper mining and smelting counties. We directly examined town mortality rates for white female residents, aged 35 to 74, in eight U.S. copper smelting communities and compared them to demographically and geographically matched communities without industries likely to produce significant air pollution, using death certificates obtained from state sources. Site-specific air quality data were also obtained for these communities.

The toxic effects of particulate matters and gaseous pollutants are often rapid and include respiratory diseases (such as asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis). OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 258 coal-based sponge iron plant workers in Barjora to assess the prevalence of respiratory diseases (self-reported) and to determine the associated factors. FINDINGS: The percentage of participants with any chronic respiratory disease, asthma and rhinoconjuctivitis were 25.5%, 8.9%, and 17.1%, respectively. The odds of any chronic respiratory disease were lower in participants with family history of any chronic respiratory disease (odds ratio [OR] 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.91, P = 0.024). The odds of asthma were lower in participants living in a room with less than 3 people (OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.16-7.07, P = 0.023) and with family history (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08-0.53, P = 0.001). The odds of rhinoconjuctivitis were lower in illiterate participants (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12-0.94, P = 0.038) and those with pucca/semipucca house type (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.11-5.39, P = 0.027).

New therapeutic approaches to these conditions are urgently needed since current treatment options provide only symptomatic relief. Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are emerging molecular target candidates for the development of novel, disease-modifying drugs addressing airway diseases. AREAS COVERED: The authors review the patent literature on novel molecules targeting TRP channels (in particular TRPA1, TRPV1, TRPM8 and TRPC6) that are currently studied in clinical trials or are candidates for future clinical evaluation in the management of respiratory diseases. EXPERT OPINION: The patent literature highlights TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels as the most advanced therapeutic targets in respiratory disorders. TRPV1 antagonists relieve cough in preclinical studies. TRPA1 antagonists not only are anti-tussive but also show efficacy in allergic asthma models. However, to date, only minimal clinical data are available regarding the effects of selective, small-molecule TRPV1 and TRPA1 blockers in respiratory disorders. Clearly, long-term clinical studies are required to confirm the expectations based on preclinical data. In conclusion, the current status of this rapidly expanding research area raises cautious optimism for TRPA1 (and possibly also TRPV1) antagonists as promising anti-tussive/anti-asthma drug candidates.",,"['Preti, Delia', 'Szallasi, Arpad', 'Patacchini, Riccardo']","['Preti D', 'Szallasi A', 'Patacchini R']",,"['University of Ferrara, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, via Fossato di Mortara 17/19, 44121, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120606,England,Expert Opin Ther Pat,Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,9516419,"['0 (Membrane Transport Modulators)', '0 (Respiratory System Agents)', '0 (TRPC Cation Channels)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Membrane Transport Modulators/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Molecular Structure', 'Patents as Topic', 'Respiratory System/*drug effects/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Respiratory System Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'TRPC Cation Channels/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,2012/06/07 06:00,2012/10/17 06:00,['2012/06/07 06:00'],"['2012/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543776.2012.696099 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Pat. 2012 Jun;22(6):663-95. doi: 10.1517/13543776.2012.696099.

These include asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cough, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, cystic fibrosis and acute lung injury. TRP channels are broadly distributed throughout the respiratory tract and play an important physiological role in sensing and subsequently responding to a wide variety of stimuli, for example temperature, osmolarity and oxidant stress. In the context of respiratory disease however TRP channel function may be altered, eg: under conditions of oxidative stress, inflammation, hypoxia and mechanical stress. In addition there is evidence that the expression/activity of TRP channels can be affected in the disease setting. Modulators of TRP channel function are therefore under investigation for a range of diseases including disorders of the respiratory system. Several excellent review articles have discussed in detail evidence that modulation of specific TRP channels may be of benefit in specific respiratory diseases. In this article we have taken the approach of reviewing evidence that modulation of TRP channel function may be able to affect common and over-lapping characteristic features of respiratory diseases, for example bronchoconstriction, airways hyper-responsiveness, cough, airways inflammation, mucus hyper-secretion, exacerbations, lung injury, hypoxia and airways re-modelling. The therapeutic potential of TRP channel modulators, the status of these agents in the clinic along with the challenges posed in this rapidly advancing field are also discussed in this review.",,"['Abbott-Banner, Katharine', 'Poll, Christopher', 'Verkuyl, J Martin']","['Abbott-Banner K', 'Poll C', 'Verkuyl JM']",,"['Verona Pharma plc, London, UK. kathy.banner@veronapharma.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Top Med Chem,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,101119673,['0 (Transient Receptor Potential Channels)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Transient Receptor Potential Channels/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,2013/03/20 06:00,2014/02/08 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2012/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['CTMC-EPUB-20130311-1 [pii]', '10.2174/1568026611313030008 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Top Med Chem. 2013;13(3):310-21. doi: 10.2174/1568026611313030008.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysfunction of both respiratory and limb muscles in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been studied in depth, and seems to be caused by the complex interaction of general (inflammation, impaired gas exchange, malnutrition, comorbidity, drugs) and local factors (changes in respiratory mechanics and muscle activity, and molecular events). Some of these factors are also present in cystic fibrosis and asthma. In obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, repeated exposure to hypoxia and the absence of reparative rest are believed to be the main causes of muscle dysfunction. Deconditioning appears to be crucial for the functional impairment observed in scoliosis. Finally, cachexia seems to be the main mechanism of muscle dysfunction in advanced lung cancer.

The impact of such ISG in clinical practice can be potentially significant in primary health care (PHC) settings. We report the impact of the use by general practitioners (GPs) of a Tunisian ISG for respiratory diseases in management of respiratory patients in PHC. METHODS: The short-term impact was assessed through the results of the feasibility study. This study included a baseline survey, before training on ISG, and an impact survey, after training on ISG. The same 73 GPs practicing within 28 PHCs were involved in the two surveys at an interval of 6 weeks. Information on each patient mentioned gender, age, underlying conditions, symptoms, referral, diagnosis and drug prescription details. RESULTS: During the periods of the baseline and impact surveys, 36.0 and 31.1% of PHC attendees, respectively, sought care for respiratory symptoms. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) cases accounted for more than 85% of patients with respiratory disease. In the impact survey, chronic respiratory disease (CRD) diagnosis increased by approximately 50%. In the same way, the proportion of tuberculosis suspects increased 5.5 times. The number of drugs prescribed per patient decreased by 18.8%, and the proportion of patients who were prescribed antibiotics decreased by 19.0%. The prescription of steroids also significantly decreased while inhaled beta-agonist prescription increased. The average cost of drug prescription was reduced by 19%. CONCLUSION: Training on ISG for respiratory diseases improved the diagnosis of CRD and tuberculosis, and lead to a more rational use of drugs for ARIs in PHCs.","['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Abouda, Maher', 'Hamzaoui, Agnes', 'Drira, Ekram', 'Djebeniani, Ridha', 'Othmani, Salah', 'Ben Kheder, Ali']","['Abouda M', 'Hamzaoui A', 'Drira E', 'Djebeniani R', 'Othmani S', 'Ben Kheder A']",,"['Respiratory Diseases Department, FSI Hospital, La Marsa, Tunisia.', ""Abderrahmen Mami Hospital, d'Ariana, Tunisia."", ""Abderrahmen Mami Hospital, d'Ariana, Tunisia."", 'WHO, Djibouti, Djibouti.', 'STOP TB, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland.', ""Abderrahmen Mami Hospital, d'Ariana, Tunisia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150707,England,J Eval Clin Pract,Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,9609066,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'General Practitioners/education/*standards', 'Humans', 'Inservice Training', 'Middle Aged', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Primary Health Care/*organization & administration/standards', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Tunisia']",,,2015/07/15 06:00,2016/06/23 06:00,['2015/07/09 06:00'],"['2015/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jep.12420 [doi]'],ppublish,J Eval Clin Pract. 2015 Oct;21(5):976-81. doi: 10.1111/jep.12420.

This study determined the mortality and hospitalization rates of respiratory diseases in Hong Kong in 2005, their trend in the past decade and their incidence/prevalence. METHODS: Mortality data were obtained from the Department of Health and hospitalization data from the Hospital Authority, Hong Kong. Incidence/prevalence data were obtained from local registries or local studies. Trends of mortality and hospitalization rates of various respiratory diseases from 1997 and 2005 were calculated after age standardization and were tested for significance using negative binomial regression analysis. Age standardized mortality rates in Hong Kong were compared with those of the UK and globally. RESULTS: Respiratory disease was the most common cause of mortality and hospitalization in Hong Kong in 2005. Globally and in the UK, cardiovascular disease ranked first in mortality. Respiratory infections ranked first in respiratory mortality, followed by respiratory tract cancer and chronic obstructive lung disease. Respiratory infections also ranked first followed by chronic obstructive lung disease in the utilization of respiratory inpatient bed-days. While mortality rates from all respiratory diseases decreased in the past decade, hospitalization rates remained unchanged. Unlike other respiratory diseases, mortality from respiratory infections have increased since 2001. Smoking is the most important risk factor in non-communicable respiratory diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory disease is responsible for the highest health-care burden locally. Increased efforts in improving management and prevention of these diseases, including tobacco control, improving air quality and vaccination against influenza and pneumococci, are necessary.",,"['Chan-Yeung, Moira', 'Lai, Christopher K W', 'Chan, Kin-Sang', 'Cheung, Amy H K', 'Yao, Tzy-Jyun', 'Ho, Alice S S', 'Ko, Fanny W', 'Yam, Loretta Y', 'Wong, Poon-Chuen', 'Tsang, Kenneth W', 'Lam, Wah-Kit', 'Ho, James C', 'Chu, Chung-Ming', 'Yu, Wai-Cho', 'Chan, Hok-Sum', 'Ip, Mary S M', 'Hui, David S', 'Tam, Cheuk-Yin']","['Chan-Yeung M', 'Lai CK', 'Chan KS', 'Cheung AH', 'Yao TJ', 'Ho AS', 'Ko FW', 'Yam LY', 'Wong PC', 'Tsang KW', 'Lam WK', 'Ho JC', 'Chu CM', 'Yu WC', 'Chan HS', 'Ip MS', 'Hui DS', 'Tam CY']",,"['Department of Medicine, Respiratory Division, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. mmwchan@hkucc.hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Respirology,"Respirology (Carlton, Vic.)",9616368,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hong Kong/epidemiology', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2008/10/31 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/31 09:00'],"['2008/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['RES1394 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1843.2008.01394.x [doi]']",ppublish,Respirology. 2008 Nov;13 Suppl 4:S133-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1843.2008.01394.x.,,,,,,,,['Respirology. 2009 Jan;14(1):150'],,['Hong Kong Thoracic Society'],,,,,,,,

Following injury, the epithelium is able to repair itself and regenerate through several mechanisms including spreading and migration of basal cells, cell proliferation and differentiation. The cellular and molecular factors involved in wound repair and epithelial regeneration interact closely, implying the participation of cytoskeleton proteins and integrins receptors, matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors as well as cytokines and growth factors secreted by airway epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The spatio-temporal modulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, and MMPs (MMP-9 and -7) during the different steps of regeneration suggests that the matrix and secretory environment are markedly involved in these mechanisms and that their dysregulation may induce remodeling of the airway mucosa.

This review describes the validity, reliability, and susceptibility to bias of the MRC questionnaire. The validity of the phlegm questions as a sensitive index of sputum production has been established but adequate validation of other symptom questions has been hindered by the absence of appropriate, independent criteria for comparison. Consistency of response averages 80 per cent for symptom questions and may reach 99 per cent for reporting of smoking habits. With proper use, the results of the MRC questionnaire are not biased by the observer, by the season of administration, or by method of administration. Modification of the questionnaire by individual investigators may lead to bias when comparisons are made between studies.

Aspiration of gastric contents into the respiratory tract is associated with the development and progression of numerous respiratory diseases in humans. In veterinary medicine the term ""aspiration"" is considered synonymous with ""aspiration pneumonia"" which, while frequently encountered, does not accurately reflect the breadth of aspiration associated respiratory syndromes (AARS). In the clinical veterinary literature, the effect of alimentary dysfunction on respiratory disease and vice versa (aerodigestive disease) is rarely investigated despite evidence in the human literature, animal models, and some studies and case reports linking alimentary and respiratory disease in small animals. Current methods of investigating aerodigestive diseases in veterinary patients are limited by inadeqate  sensitivity or specificity, potential for bias, cost, and availability. This necessitates investigations into advanced diagnostics to identify potentially underrecognized animals with AARS. Additionally, similarities in anatomy, physiology, and several disorders between dogs and humans, make experimental and naturally occurring canine models of AARS integral to translational research. Thus, evaluating dogs with aerodigestive disease might represent an area of substantial clinical relevance in human as well as veterinary medicine.","['(c) 2023 The Authors.

Neutrophils play a major role in chronic respiratory diseases. In respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer and others, there occurs extreme infiltration and activation of neutrophils followed by a cascade of events like oxidative stress and dysregulated cellular proteins that eventually result in apoptosis and tissue damage. Dysregulation of neutrophil effector functions including delayed neutropil apoptosis, increased neutrophil extracellular traps in the pathogenesis of asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease enable neutrophils as a potential therapeutic target. Accounting to their role in pathogenesis, neutrophils present as an excellent therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic respiratory diseases. This review highlights the current status and the emerging trends in novel drug delivery systems such as nanoparticles, liposomes, microspheres, and other newer nanosystems that can target neutrophils and their molecular pathways, in the airways against infections, inflammation, and cancer. These drug delivery systems are promising in providing sustained drug delivery, reduced therapeutic dose, improved patient compliance, and reduced drug toxicity. In addition, the review also discusses emerging strategies and the future perspectives in neutrophil-based therapy.","['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Chellappan, Dinesh K', 'Yee, Lim W', 'Xuan, Kong Y', 'Kunalan, Kishen', 'Rou, Lim C', 'Jean, Leong S', 'Ying, Lee Y', 'Wie, Lee X', 'Chellian, Jestin', 'Mehta, Meenu', 'Satija, Saurabh', 'Singh, Sachin K', 'Gulati, Monica', 'Dureja, Harish', 'Da Silva, Mateus Webba', 'Tambuwala, Murtaza M', 'Gupta, Gaurav', 'Paudel, Keshav R', 'Wadhwa, Ridhima', 'Hansbro, Philip M', 'Dua, Kamal']","['Chellappan DK', 'Yee LW', 'Xuan KY', 'Kunalan K', 'Rou LC', 'Jean LS', 'Ying LY', 'Wie LX', 'Chellian J', 'Mehta M', 'Satija S', 'Singh SK', 'Gulati M', 'Dureja H', 'Da Silva MW', 'Tambuwala MM', 'Gupta G', 'Paudel KR', 'Wadhwa R', 'Hansbro PM', 'Dua K']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3980-0596', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8499-9891', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7941-0229', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3591-2080', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7507-1159']","['Department of Life Sciences, School of Pharmacy, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'School of Pharmacy, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'School of Pharmacy, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'School of Pharmacy, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'School of Pharmacy, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'School of Pharmacy, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'School of Pharmacy, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'School of Pharmacy, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Life Sciences, School of Pharmacy, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab, India.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab, India.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab, India.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab, India.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana, India.', 'School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ulster University, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom.', 'School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ulster University, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom.', 'School of Phamacy, Suresh Gyan Vihar University, Jaipur, India.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Centre for Inflammation, Centenary Institute, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Centre for Inflammation, Centenary Institute, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Discipline of Pharmacy, Graduate School of Health, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Centre for Inflammation, Centenary Institute, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute (HMRI) & School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Centre for Inflammation, Centenary Institute, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Discipline of Pharmacy, Graduate School of Health, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, Hunter Medical Research Institute (HMRI) & School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shoolini University, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200212,United States,Drug Dev Res,Drug development research,8204468,,IM,"['Animals', 'Chronic Disease', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Immune System/immunology', 'Inflammation/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Neutrophils/immunology/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*drug therapy/immunology/physiopathology']",,,2020/02/13 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ddr.21648 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Dev Res. 2020 Jun;81(4):419-436. doi: 10.1002/ddr.21648.

The purpose of this study was to compare hospitalizations and deaths due to respiratory illnesses during influenza seasons among seniors (aged 65+) living in the community, senior residences (apartments reserved for seniors), and nursing homes. METHODS: Using administrative data, all hospital admissions and deaths due to respiratory illnesses (pneumonia and influenza, chronic lung disease, and acute respiratory diseases) were identified for all individuals aged 65 and older living in Winnipeg, Canada (approximately 88,000 individuals) during four influenza seasons (1995-1996 to 1998-1999). RESULTS: Hospitalization and death rates for respiratory illnesses increased significantly during influenza seasons, compared to fall periods (e.g., 42.7 vs 25.2 hospitalizations per 1000 population aged 80 and older). Moreover, hospitalization rates for pneumonia and influenza, chronic lung disease, and acute respiratory diseases were higher among individuals living in senior residences (42.5 per 1000 for all respiratory illnesses combined) than their counterparts living in the community (22.8 per 1000). Furthermore, deaths due to pneumonia and influenza and chronic lung disease were higher among senior housing residents (4.2 per 1000) than community residents (2.6 per 1000) and were particularly high among nursing home residents (52.1 per 1000). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals living in seniors residences are at increased risk of being hospitalized for and dying of respiratory illnesses during influenza seasons. Given that influenza vaccination is currently the best method to reduce influenza-associated illnesses among seniors, this suggests that influenza vaccination strategies should be targeted at this population.",,"['Menec, Verena H', 'MacWilliam, Leonard', 'Aoki, Fred Y']","['Menec VH', 'MacWilliam L', 'Aoki FY']",,"['Department of Community Health Sciences and Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, The University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada. vmenec@cpe.umanitoba.ca']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,"The journals of gerontology.

Between 1912 and 1919, the Labor Department published two detailed investigations of mortality by cause of death among cotton mill workers and other residents of several New England mill towns. Statistical tests reveal no significant difference in mortality rates from nontubercular respiratory diseases between cotton textile workers and other mill town residents. Even when ex-mill workers who may have died from mill-related respiratory ailments are added to work-related deaths and subtracted from the control group, mortality rates do not differ significantly. Finally, when mortality rates for workers in the most dusty areas of the mills--picking and carding--are compared with those of other Fall River, Mass., residents, the differences are still not statistically significant.

Recent work shows that the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases is not optimal. This increases the utilisation of health care resources. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 28 patients of the municipality of Val del Dubra (Northwest Spain) aged between 65 and 74 years. We performed a spirometric exploration and carried out a questionnaire interview on respiratory symptoms, life style, and occupational and health-related antecedents. RESULTS: Among men, 54% of were or are smokers. None of the women ever smoked. Respiratory symptoms were more frequent among women than among men (80% versus 54%). In the spirometric study, the largest volumes and flux are observed among non-smoking males who do not report dyspnea. DISCUSSION: Respiratory symptoms are frequent in the rural population aged between 65 and 74 years. Tobacco consumption is similar to other Spanish communities, but different from that seen in other countries.

Respiratory airflow and tidal volume were measured with a breathing mask-Fleisch pneumotachograph assembly. TBFVL were traced from these values using a computerized method. All the loop indices proposed by Amis and Kurpershoek (1986a) were calculated from 5 representative breathing cycles for each of the 52 animals. The TBFVL shapes and indices were relatively constant in most healthy cattle and were not correlated with the body size. When compared to normal values, animals with moderate respiratory syndromes (Groups B and C) had a more flattened shape to their TBFVL. On the other hand, in most cattle with severe respiratory pathologies (Groups D, F and G expiration tended to be biphasic with the peak expiratory flow (PEF) occurring significantly later than in healthy animals.

DESIGN: Time series study of hospitalization rates using secondary information from the Hospital Information System of the Brazil's Unified Health System. SAMPLE: Hospitalizations of children under five years of age living in Brazilian regions. Hospitalizations were separated according to cause: nose and throat infections, asthma, bacterial pneumonias, and lung diseases. MEASUREMENTS: Rates were calculated for total hospitalizations for ACSRD, and by cause, age group, and region. Trends were analyzed by using means of simple linear regression and were classified into stationary (p >/= .05), ascending (beta positive and p < .05) or declining (beta negative and p < .05) trends. RESULTS: All regions showed stationary trends in total hospitalization rates for ACSRDs, except in the Southeast, where trends were ascending. Asthma was the only cause that showed a declining trend. Bacterial pneumonias showed stationary trends, while lung diseases and nose and throat infections had predominantly ascending trends. CONCLUSION: Brazil's hospitalization rates for ACSRDs are high.

However, no study has evaluated the effect of regulatory actions to prohibit vegetation burning on respiratory morbidity. We examined the effect of a burning ban enforced in May 2016 on hospital visits for respiratory diseases in UNT. METHODS: This study used data from eight provinces in UNT. Analyses were conducted for January to April of 2014-2016 (before ban enforcement) and January to April of 2017-2018 (after ban enforcement). Particulate matter of 10 microns in diameter or smaller (PM10) concentrations, numbers of satellite fire hotspots and age-standardized rates of hospital visits for respiratory diseases before and after ban enforcement were compared. The effect of the ban on hospital visits for respiratory diseases was evaluated using an interrupted time-series analysis controlled for season-specific temporal trends, day of week, public holiday, temperature, relative humidity, number of hospitals and offset population, with gastrointestinal diseases as a negative control. A meta-analysis was performed to pool province-specific effect estimates. RESULTS: The daily average PM10 concentration and the number of fire hotspots decreased after ban enforcement in all provinces in UNT, with percent changes ranging from 5.3 to 34.3% and 14.3 to 81.5%, respectively. The adjusted pooled effect estimates of hospital visits for respiratory diseases decreased by 9.1% (95% CI: 5.1, 12.9), whereas a null association was observed for gastrointestinal diseases. CONCLUSION: The burning ban had a positive impact on both air pollution levels and rates of hospital visits for respiratory diseases in UNT.","['(c) The Author(s) 2022; all rights reserved.

Therefore, new methods of treatment, as well as prevention, need to be investigated. A group of compounds that should be considered for use in respiratory diseases is cannabinoids. There are three groups of cannabinoids - plant-derived phytocannabinoids, synthetic cannabinoids, and endogenous endocannabinoids including the enzymes responsible for their synthesis and degradation. All cannabinoids exert their biological effects through either type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB(1)) and/or type 2 cannabinoid receptors (CB(2)). In numerous studies (in vitro and in vivo), cannabinoids and inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation have shown beneficial anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer, and anti-fibrotic properties. Although in the respiratory system, most of the studies have focused on the positive properties of cannabinoids and inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation. There are few research reports discussing the negative impact of these compounds. This review summarizes the properties and mechanisms of action of cannabinoids and inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation in various models of respiratory diseases. A short description of the effects selected cannabinoids have on the human respiratory system and their possible use in the fight against COVID-19 is also presented.

Inspection of the neck adds useful information, particularly with respect to the dynamics of breathing. Palpation ascertains the signs suggested by inspection with respect to the mechanics of breathing. It also assesses the state of the pleura and pulmonary parenchyma by studying the tactile fremitus. It integrates extrarespiratory signs, such as enlarged lymph nodes or breast abnormalities. Extrathoracic respiratory signs should also be systematically looked for, including cyanosis, finger deformation, pulsus paradoxus, and pursed lips breathing. Interobserver agreement about respiratory signs has repeatedly been studied, and generally found to be low, as are clinical-functional correlations. However, some data on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma or pulmonary embolism are available. From the description of some signs and the current knowledge about their operative values, it appears that much clinical research remains necessary to better define the precise diagnostic value of a given sign. The impact of training on diagnostic performance also has to be defined.

The causative agents and industrial categories in which they occurred are also characterised. DESIGN: Voluntary monthly reporting of newly diagnosed cases by pulmonologists, occupational medicine practitioners and occupational health nurses. SETTING: Medical and occupational health referral centres in the nine provinces of South Africa. SUBJECTS: Cases were workers from non-mining industries or ex-miners, suffering from a newly diagnosed occupational respiratory disease, reported to SORDSA between October 1996 and December 1999. OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequencies of reported occupational respiratory disease by year, reporting source, province and sex. Frequencies of short- and long-latency diseases by industry and causative agent. RESULTS: There was incomplete reporting coverage of the nine provinces in the first 3 years. Reporting was most comprehensive from Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape. Diseases with long latency periods made up 76.2% of the cases. Pneumoconiosis, even in non-mining industries, was the most frequently reported disease, followed by inhalation accidents. Occupational asthma was the fourth most reported disease. Apart from the prominence of pneumoconiosis, the results obtained by SORDSA are similar to those from a British occupational lung disease surveillance scheme. This study showed that newly diagnosed cases of occupational lung disease occurred in many industries and were caused by a variety of agents. CONCLUSION: SORDSA has contributed insight into the nature, extent and distribution of occupational respiratory diseases in South Africa. It has also highlighted important causes of occupational respiratory diseases in South Africa, as well as hazardous industries. The data indicate that South Africa has a widespread occupational lung disease problem, and provide a platform for targeted prevention strategies.",,"['Esterhuizen, T M', 'Hnizdo, E', 'Rees, D', 'Lalloo, U G', 'Kielkowski, D', 'van Schalkwyk, E M', 'White, N', 'Smith, F C', 'Hoggins, B', 'Curtis, T']","['Esterhuizen TM', 'Hnizdo E', 'Rees D', 'Lalloo UG', 'Kielkowski D', 'van Schalkwyk EM', 'White N', 'Smith FC', 'Hoggins B', 'Curtis T']",,"['National Centre for Occupational Health, Department of Health, Johannesburg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,South Africa,S Afr Med J,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,0404520,,IM,"['Accidents, Occupational/statistics & numerical data', 'Databases, Factual', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Industry/statistics & numerical data', 'Inhalation Exposure/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Needs Assessment', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Occupations/statistics & numerical data', 'Population Surveillance/methods', 'Registries', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Risk Factors', 'South Africa/epidemiology']",,,2001/07/18 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/07/18 10:00'],"['2001/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,S Afr Med J. 2001 Jun;91(6):502-8.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that AD events may lead to increased visits by children to emergency medical centers due to bronchial asthma and respiratory diseases, including bronchial asthma. METHODS: We used anonymized data on children receiving primary emergency treatment at Nagasaki Municipal Primary Emergency Medical Center, Japan between March 2010 and September 2013. We used Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data to assess AD exposure and performed time-stratified case-crossover analyses to examine the association between AD exposure and emergency department visits. The main analysis was done with data collected from March through May each year. RESULTS: The total number of emergency department visits during the study period was 756 for bronchial asthma and 5421 for respiratory diseases, and the number of ""AD days"" was 47. In school children, AD events at lag day 3 and lag day 4 were associated with increased emergency department visits due to bronchial asthma, with odds ratios of 1.837 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.212-2.786) and 1.829 (95% CI, 1.179-2.806), respectively.

The present study was conducted to evaluate some of the risk factors, which included locations of farm, ventilation facilities, number of farms in 1 km(2) area, agro-climatic zone, and age of flock in relation to respiratory problem in Haryana, India. One hundred poultry flocks with respiratory problems were identified and selected for conducting the survey. The ""ODK Collect"" app installed on a smartphone was used to capture coordinates of the farms. The collected data was accessed through http://odkproject-iirs.appspot.com/ . The location of farms was mapped with the help of QGIS. All the three parameters, viz., morbidity, mortality (p < 0.001), and case fatality rate (CFR) (p = 0.045), were significantly higher in birds of age 0-2 weeks. Natural ventilation was the most common facility observed in the present study (51/100). Maximum morbidity and mortality were observed in small flocks (< 10,000), whereas maximum CFR was observed in medium-sized flocks (> 10,000-30,000), and there was a significant difference in morbidity, mortality, and CFR. Further, there was a significant difference between agro-climatic zones with respect to morbidity and mortality (p < 0.001). It can be concluded that age, flock size, and agro-climatic conditions have an impact on intensity of diseases especially respiratory diseases. Therefore, special precautions should be taken for young flock. Flock size should be adequate, and such management practices should be adopted that are suitable for particular climatic conditions.",,"['Vaishali', 'Gupta, Renu', 'Jhandai, Punit', 'Singh, Davinder']","['Vaishali', 'Gupta R', 'Jhandai P', 'Singh D']",,"['Department of Veterinary Public Health and Epidemiology, Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Hisar, Haryana, 125004, India.', 'Department of Veterinary Public Health and Epidemiology, Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Hisar, Haryana, 125004, India. renu.gupta@luvas.edu.in.', 'Department of Veterinary Public Health and Epidemiology, Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Hisar, Haryana, 125004, India.', 'ADIO, RVDEC (Mahendergarh), Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Hisar, Haryana, 125004, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200623,United States,Trop Anim Health Prod,Tropical animal health and production,1277355,,IM,"['Animal Husbandry', 'Animals', 'Chickens', 'Farms', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'India/epidemiology', '*Poultry', '*Poultry Diseases/epidemiology', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/epidemiology/*veterinary']",,,2020/06/25 06:00,2021/06/02 06:00,['2020/06/25 06:00'],"['2019/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11250-020-02336-0 [pii]', '10.1007/s11250-020-02336-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Trop Anim Health Prod. 2020 Nov;52(6):3123-3134. doi: 10.1007/s11250-020-02336-0.

In this present study, we developed a detection system of microbes from porcine respiratory by using TaqMan real-time PCR (referred to as Dempo-PCR) to screen a broad range of pathogens associated with porcine respiratory diseases in a single run. We selected 17 porcine respiratory pathogens (Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Boldetella bronchiseptica, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella multocida toxin, Streptococcus suis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Mycoplasma hyosynovie, porcine circovirus 2, pseudorabies virus, porcine cytomegalovirus, swine influenza A virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, EU strain, porcine respiratory coronavirus and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) as detection targets and designed novel specific primer-probe sets for seven of them. In sensitivity test by using standard curves from synthesized DNA, all primer-probe sets showed high sensitivity. However, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus is known to have a high frequency of genetic mutations, and the primer and probe sequences will need to be checked at a considerable frequency when performing Dempo-PCR from field samples. A total of 30 lung samples from swine showing respiratory symptoms on six farms were tested by the Dempo-PCR to validate the assay's clinical performance. As the results, 12 pathogens (5 virus and 7 bacteria) were detected and porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Haemophilus parasuis, and porcine cytomegalovirus were detected at high frequency.
