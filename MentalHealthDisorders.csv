The article discusses basic concepts relevant to the medical model (illness, disease, disorder, condition, etc.), the nature of medical knowledge and diagnostic construct, medical classifications in psychiatry, and the medical model within multidisciplinary practice. Salient criticisms of the medical model are discussed and addressed at relevant points. It is recognized that concepts such as disease and illness lack uncontested definitions and are not free from value judgements even in general medicine. Diagnostic constructs used in psychiatry are often descriptive heterogenous categories which can nonetheless offer clinical utility. The medical model co-exists with non-medical approaches and perspectives, and psychiatrists work in an interdisciplinary context with other models and professionals. Criticism of the medical model in psychiatry often fail to recognize the continuities between psychiatry and the rest of medicine, and the persistence of these controversies may be a result of fundamental disagreement over values.","['Huda, Ahmed Samei']",['Huda AS'],"['Tameside and Glossop EIT, Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, Pennine Care Trust HQ, Ashton-under-Lyne, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201208,England,Int Rev Psychiatry,"International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)",8918131,IM,"['Humans', '*Mental Disorders/diagnosis/therapy', '*Mental Health', '*Psychiatry']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Psychiatry', 'clinical heuristics', 'clinical psychology', 'critical psychiatry', 'nosology', 'philosophy of mental health']",2020/12/09 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2020/12/08 12:16'],"['2020/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/08 12:16 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09540261.2020.1845125 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Rev Psychiatry. 2021 Aug;33(5):463-470. doi: 10.1080/09540261.2020.1845125.

Research indicates that colonialism and its associated processes are important determinants of Indigenous peoples' health internationally. In Canada, despite an abundance of health research documenting inequalities in morbidity and mortality rates for Indigenous peoples, relatively little research has focused on mental health. This paper provides a critical scoping review of the literature related to Indigenous mental health in Canada. We searched eleven databases and two Indigenous health-focused journals for research related to mental health, Indigenous peoples, and Canada, for the years 2006-2016. Over two hundred papers are included in the review and coded according to research theme, population group, and geography. Results demonstrate that the literature is overwhelmingly concerned with issues related to colonialism in mental health services and the prevalence and causes of mental illness among Indigenous peoples in Canada, but with several significant gaps. Mental health research related to Indigenous peoples in Canada overemphasizes suicide and problematic substance use; a more critical use of the concepts of colonialism and historical trauma is advised; and several population groups are underrepresented in research, including Metis peoples and urban or off-reserve Indigenous peoples. The findings are useful in an international context by providing a starting point for discussions, dialogue, and further study regarding mental health research for Indigenous peoples around the world.","['Nelson, Sarah E', 'Wilson, Kathi']","['Nelson SE', 'Wilson K']","['University of Toronto Mississauga, Department of Geography, 3359 Mississauga Road, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.

This paper aims to summarize current knowledge on mental health interventions of relevance to incarcerated PLHIV and apply implementation science theory to highlight strategies and approaches to deliver mental health services for PLHIV in correctional settings in SSA. RECENT FINDINGS: Scarce evidence-based mental health interventions have been rigorously evaluated among incarcerated PLHIV in SSA. Emerging evidence from low- and middle-income countries and correctional settings outside SSA point to a role for cognitive behavioral therapy-based talking and group interventions implemented using task-shifting strategies involving lay health workers and peer educators. Several mental health interventions and implementation strategies hold promise for addressing common mental health disorders among incarcerated PLHIV in SSA. However, to deliver these approaches, there must first be pragmatic efforts to build corrections health system capacity, address human rights abuses that exacerbate HIV and mental health, and re-conceptualize mental health services as integral to quality HIV service delivery and universal access to primary healthcare for all incarcerated people.","['Smith, Helene J', 'Topp, Stephanie M', 'Hoffmann, Christopher J', 'Ndlovu, Thulani', 'Charalambous, Salome', 'Murray, Laura', 'Kane, Jeremy', 'Sikazwe, Izukanji', 'Muyoyeta, Monde', 'Herce, Michael E']","['Smith HJ', 'Topp SM', 'Hoffmann CJ', 'Ndlovu T', 'Charalambous S', 'Murray L', 'Kane J', 'Sikazwe I', 'Muyoyeta M', 'Herce ME']","['Implementation Science Unit, Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ), Lusaka, Zambia.', 'James Cook University, Townsville, Australia.', 'The Aurum Institute, Johannesburg, South Africa.', 'Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'The Aurum Institute, Johannesburg, South Africa.', 'The Aurum Institute, Johannesburg, South Africa.', 'University of the Witwatersrand Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.', 'Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Implementation Science Unit, Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ), Lusaka, Zambia.', 'Implementation Science Unit, Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ), Lusaka, Zambia.', 'Implementation Science Unit, Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ), Lusaka, Zambia. michael.herce@cidrz.org.', 'Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. michael.herce@cidrz.org.']",['eng'],['K01 TW010272/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Curr HIV/AIDS Rep,Current HIV/AIDS reports,101235661,IM,"['Africa South of the Sahara', 'Depressive Disorder, Major', 'Government Programs', 'HIV Infections/*psychology', 'Humans', '*Implementation Science', 'Mental Disorders/*psychology', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', '*Mental Health Services', 'Prisoners/*psychology', 'Substance-Related Disorders']",PMC7668352,['NIHMS1619394'],['NOTNLM'],"['Depression', 'HIV', 'Implementation science', 'Mental health', 'Peer', 'Prisons', 'Sub-Saharan Africa']",2020/08/12 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/08/12 06:00'],"['2020/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11904-020-00518-x [pii]', '10.1007/s11904-020-00518-x [doi]']",ppublish,Curr HIV/AIDS Rep. 2020 Oct;17(5):438-449. doi: 10.1007/s11904-020-00518-x.,5,,,"['Conflict of Interest Helene Smith, Stephanie M Topp, Christopher Hoffman, Thulani', 'Ndlovu, Salome Charalambous, Laura Murray, Jeremy Kane, Monde Muyoyeta, Izukanji', 'Sikazwe and Michael E Herce declare that they have no conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several gaps in the literature are highlighted alongside recommendations for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: PA in the general population has established efficacy in preventing and managing cardiovascular disease and improving wellbeing. Recent epidemiological data further suggests that people who are more active may be less likely to have anxiety disorders. In addition, evidence from systematic reviews of randomised control trials suggests that exercise training, a subset of PA, can reduce symptoms in anxiety and stress-related disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia and panic disorder. Anxiety disorders are common, burdensome and costly to individuals and wider society. In addition to the profound negative impact on individuals' wellbeing and functioning, they are associated with worsened physical health, including a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases and premature mortality. Although pharmacotherapy and psychological interventions are helpful for many, these treatment approaches are not effective for everyone and are insufficient to address common physical health complications, such as the elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. Given the combined anxiolytic and physical health benefits of increased activity, PA presents a promising additional treatment option for people with anxiety disorders. However, there remain key gaps in the literature regarding the mechanisms underlying the effects of PA, optimal PA protocols, methods of improving adherence and the importance of physical fitness. These must be addressed for PA to be successfully implemented in mental health services.","['Kandola, Aaron', 'Vancampfort, Davy', 'Herring, Matthew', 'Rebar, Amanda', 'Hallgren, Mats', 'Firth, Joseph', 'Stubbs, Brendon']","['Kandola A', 'Vancampfort D', 'Herring M', 'Rebar A', 'Hallgren M', 'Firth J', 'Stubbs B']","['Physiotherapy Department, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill, London, SE5 9RS, UK. aaron.kandola@gmail.com.', 'KU Leuven Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven Department of Neurosciences, UPC KU Leuven, Kortenberg, Belgium.', 'Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.', 'Health Research Institute, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.', 'Physical Activity Research Group, School of Health, Medical and Applied Sciences, Central Queensland University, Rockhampton, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'NICM Health Research Institute, School of Science and Health, University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Division of Psychology and Mental Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Physiotherapy Department, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill, London, SE5 9RS, UK.', ""Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.""]",['eng'],['ICA-CL-2017-03-001/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180724,United States,Curr Psychiatry Rep,Current psychiatry reports,100888960,,"['Anxiety/*epidemiology/psychology/*therapy', 'Anxiety Disorders/*epidemiology/psychology/*therapy', 'Exercise/*psychology', 'Exercise Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/psychology/therapy']",PMC6061211,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cardiovascular disease', 'Depression', 'Exercise', 'Fitness', 'Mental health', 'Stress']",2018/07/26 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2018/07/26 06:00'],"['2018/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11920-018-0923-x [pii]', '923 [pii]', '10.1007/s11920-018-0923-x [doi]']",epublish,Curr Psychiatry Rep. 2018 Jul 24;20(8):63. doi: 10.1007/s11920-018-0923-x.,8,,,"['CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Aaron Kandola, Davy Vancampfort, Matthew Herring, Amanda', 'Rebar, Mats Hallgren, Joseph Firth and Brendon Stubbs declare that they have no', 'conflict of interest.

Many common physical conditions are more common among people who also have a common mental disorder. This scoping review aims to examine the current literature about the prevention, identification and treatment of physical problems among people with pre-existing mental health disorders in primary care in Europe. METHODS: The scoping review framework comprised a five-stage process developed by Arksey & O'Malley (2005). The search process was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Both quantitative and qualitative studies were included, with no restriction on study design. RESULTS: The initial search identified 299 studies, with a further 28 added from the hand-search (total n = 327) of which 19 were considered relevant to the review research question and included for full analysis. Depression was the mental health condition most commonly studied (nine studies), followed by depression and anxiety (seven studies), with three studies examining any mental disorder. Eleven studies examined the effects of various interventions to address physical and mental comorbidity, with the most commonly studied intervention being collaborative care. CONCLUSIONS: With just 19 studies meeting our criteria for inclusion, there is clearly a paucity of research in this area. Further research is essential in order to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association between mental disorders and chronic conditions.","['Fogarty, F', 'McCombe, G', 'Brown, K', 'Van Amelsvoort, T', 'Clarke, M', 'Cullen, W']","['Fogarty F', 'McCombe G', 'Brown K', 'Van Amelsvoort T', 'Clarke M', 'Cullen W']","['School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Ireland.', 'School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Ireland.', 'Health Services Executive, Ireland.', 'School of Mental Health and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, Netherlands.', 'Saint John of God Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.', 'School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20200228,England,Ir J Psychol Med,Irish journal of psychological medicine,8900208,IM,"['Adult', 'Europe', 'Humans', '*Mental Health', 'Primary Health Care', '*Psychotic Disorders', 'Qualitative Research']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mental health', 'physical health', 'primary care']",2020/02/29 06:00,2021/07/01 06:00,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0790966720000026 [pii]', '10.1017/ipm.2020.2 [doi]']",ppublish,Ir J Psychol Med. 2021 Mar;38(1):76-92. doi: 10.1017/ipm.2020.2.

This work environment has positive effects when work provides satisfaction and contributes to personal self-fulfilment, or negative effects provoked by situations of stress, inadequate working patterns and schedules, possible situations of abuse and/or harassment, etc., which may contribute to the appearance of alterations in the mental health of the worker. Therefore, it is crucial that organisations use strategies for mental health promotion and disease prevention in the workplace, as mental health problems arising from work represent a major burden of disease for society and the economy of a country. Stress can be considered one of the main factors capable of disrupting a person's mental health and determining the development of a mental disorder, but other individual, socio-cultural, organisational, biological, and environmental factors also play a role to a greater or lesser extent. A negative work situation can trigger the development of serious mental disorders such as psychotic, neurotic, or cognitive disorders, as well as those derived from work-related stress and psychoactive substance abuse, and self-injurious behaviours. For early detection, treatment, reintegration, and/or rehabilitation, coordination between the public health system and occupational health or occupational risk prevention services is necessary.","['Allande-Cusso, Regina', 'Garcia-Iglesias, Juan Jesus', 'Fagundo-Rivera, Javier', 'Navarro-Abal, Yolanda', 'Climent-Rodriguez, Jose Antonio', 'Gomez-Salgado, Juan']","['Allande-Cusso R', 'Garcia-Iglesias JJ', 'Fagundo-Rivera J', 'Navarro-Abal Y', 'Climent-Rodriguez JA', 'Gomez-Salgado J']","['Departamento de Enfermeria.

Whether mental health promotion and prevention interventions provide value for money in children, adolescents, adults, and older adults is unclear. The aim of the current study is to update 2 existing reviews of cost-effectiveness studies in this field in order to determine whether such interventions are cost-effective. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Electronic databases (including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EconLit through EBSCO and Embase) were searched for published cost-effectiveness studies of prevention of mental disorders and promotion of mental health and well-being from 2008 to 2020. The quality of studies was assessed using the Quality of Health Economic Studies Instrument (QHES). The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (# CRD42019127778). The primary outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) or return on investment (ROI) ratio across all studies. A total of 65 studies met the inclusion criteria of a full economic evaluation, of which, 23 targeted children and adolescents, 35 targeted adults, while the remaining targeted older adults. A large number of studies focused on prevention of depression and/or anxiety disorders, followed by promotion of mental health and well-being and other mental disorders. Although there was high heterogeneity in terms of the design among included economic evaluations, most studies consistently found that interventions for mental health prevention and promotion were cost-effective or cost saving. The review found that targeted prevention was likely to be cost-effective compared to universal prevention. Screening plus psychological interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT]) at school were the most cost-effective interventions for prevention of mental disorders in children and adolescents, while parenting interventions and workplace interventions had good evidence in mental health promotion. There is inconclusive evidence for preventive interventions for mental disorders or mental health promotion in older adults. While studies were of general high quality, there was limited evidence available from low- and middle-income countries. The review was limited to studies where mental health was the primary outcome and may have missed general health promoting strategies that could also prevent mental disorder or promote mental health. Some ROI studies might not be included given that these studies are commonly published in grey literature rather than in the academic literature. CONCLUSIONS: Our review found a significant growth of economic evaluations in prevention of mental disorders or promotion of mental health and well-being over the last 10 years. Although several interventions for mental health prevention and promotion provide good value for money, the varied quality as well as methodologies used in economic evaluations limit the generalisability of conclusions about cost-effectiveness. However, the finding that the majority of studies especially in children, adolescents, and adults demonstrated good value for money is promising. Research on cost-effectiveness in low-middle income settings is required.

Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) living in the United States are at increased risk for homelessness, and have also evidenced elevated mental health and substance use disorder prevalence relative to their non-MSM male counterparts. DESIGN AND METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial estimating the diagnostic prevalence of substance use/mental health disorder comorbidity among a sample of homeless, substance-dependent MSM (DSM-IV verified; n = 131). RESULTS: The most prevalent substance use/mental health disorder comorbidities were stimulant dependence comorbid with at least one depressive disorder (28%), alcohol dependence comorbid with at least one depressive disorder (26%) and stimulant dependence comorbid with antisocial personality disorder (25%). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic depression and antisocial personality disorder both demonstrated high rates of prevalence among homeless, substance-dependent (particularly stimulant and alcohol dependent) MSM.

RECENT FINDINGS: Both the direct and flow-on effects of climate change place children at risk of mental health consequences including PTSD, depression, anxiety, phobias, sleep disorders, attachment disorders, and substance abuse. These in turn can lead to problems with emotion regulation, cognition, learning, behavior, language development, and academic performance. Together, these create predispositions to adverse adult mental health outcomes. Children also exhibit high levels of concern over climate change. Meaning-focused coping promotes well-being and environmental engagement. Both direct and indirect climate change impacts affect children's psychological well-being. Children in the developing world will suffer the worst impacts. Mental health professionals have important roles in helping mitigate climate change, and researching and implementing approaches to helping children cope with its impacts.","['Burke, Susie E L', 'Sanson, Ann V', 'Van Hoorn, Judith']","['Burke SEL', 'Sanson AV', 'Van Hoorn J']","['Australian Psychological Society, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

A selected overview of the scope, current topics as well as strength and gaps in Psychological Science may help to depict the advances needed to inform future research agendas specifically on mental health and mental disorders. From an integrative psychological perspective, most maladaptive health behaviours and mental disorders can be conceptualized as the result of developmental dysfunctions of psychological functions and processes as well as neurobiological and genetic processes that interact with the environment. The paper presents and discusses an integrative translational model, linking basic and experimental research with clinical research as well as population-based prospective-longitudinal studies. This model provides a conceptual framework to identify how individual vulnerabilities interact with environment over time, and promote critical behaviours that might act as proximal risk factors for ill-health and mental disorders. Within the models framework, such improved knowledge is also expected to better delineate targeted preventive and therapeutic interventions that prevent further escalation in early stages before the full disorder and further complications thereof develop. In contrast to conventional ""personalized medicine"" that typically targets individual (genetic) variation of patients who already have developed a disease to improve medical treatment, the proposed framework model, linked to a concerted funding programme of the ""Science of Behaviour Change"", carries the promise of improved diagnosis, treatment and prevention of health-risk behaviour constellations as well as mental disorders.","['Wittchen, Hans-Ulrich', 'Knappe, Susanne', 'Andersson, Gerhard', 'Araya, Ricardo', 'Banos Rivera, Rosa M', 'Barkham, Michael', 'Bech, Per', 'Beckers, Tom', 'Berger, Thomas', 'Berking, Matthias', 'Berrocal, Carmen', 'Botella, Christina', 'Carlbring, Per', 'Chouinard, Guy', 'Colom, Francesc', 'Csillag, Claudio', 'Cujipers, Pim', 'David, Daniel', 'Emmelkamp, Paul M G', 'Essau, Cecilia A', 'Fava, Giovanni A', 'Goschke, Thomas', 'Hermans, Dirk', 'Hofmann, Stefan G', 'Lutz, Wolfgang', 'Muris, Peter', 'Ollendick, Thomas H', 'Raes, Filip', 'Rief, Winfried', 'Riper, Heleen', 'Tossani, Eliana', 'van der Oord, Saskia', 'Vervliet, Bram', 'Haro, Josep M', 'Schumann, Gunter']","['Wittchen HU', 'Knappe S', 'Andersson G', 'Araya R', 'Banos Rivera RM', 'Barkham M', 'Bech P', 'Beckers T', 'Berger T', 'Berking M', 'Berrocal C', 'Botella C', 'Carlbring P', 'Chouinard G', 'Colom F', 'Csillag C', 'Cujipers P', 'David D', 'Emmelkamp PM', 'Essau CA', 'Fava GA', 'Goschke T', 'Hermans D', 'Hofmann SG', 'Lutz W', 'Muris P', 'Ollendick TH', 'Raes F', 'Rief W', 'Riper H', 'Tossani E', 'van der Oord S', 'Vervliet B', 'Haro JM', 'Schumann G']","['Institute of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Longitudinal Studies (CELOS), Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Int J Methods Psychiatr Res,International journal of methods in psychiatric research,9111433,IM,"['*Behavioral Sciences', '*Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*psychology/*therapy', '*Mental Health', '*Translational Research, Biomedical']",PMC6878303,,['NOTNLM'],"['agenda', 'behaviour change', 'health behaviour', 'mental disorder', 'mental health', 'personalized medicine', 'psychology', 'translation']",2014/01/01 06:00,2015/04/04 06:00,['2013/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['MPR1409 [pii]', '10.1002/mpr.1409 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Methods Psychiatr Res. 2014 Jan;23 Suppl 1(Suppl 1):28-40. doi: 10.1002/mpr.1409.,Suppl 1,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rather, all of these factors tend to interact synergistically in various and consequential ways, having a substantial impact on the health of individuals and whole populations. Specifically, a syndemics approach examines why certain diseases cluster (ie, multiple diseases affecting individuals and groups); the pathways through which they interact biologically in individuals and within populations, and thereby multiply their overall disease burden, and the ways in which social environments, especially conditions of social inequality and injustice, contribute to disease clustering and interaction as well as to vulnerability.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of mental health disorders with health care costs among people with chronic diseases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cohort study in the Canadian province of Alberta collected data from April 1, 2012, to March 31, 2015, among 991 445 adults 18 years and older with a chronic disease (ie, asthma, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, chronic pulmonary disease, or chronic kidney disease). Data analysis was conducted from October 2017 to August 2018. EXPOSURES: Mental health disorder (ie, depression, schizophrenia, alcohol use disorder, or drug use disorder). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Resource use, mean total unadjusted and adjusted 3-year health care costs, and mean total unadjusted 3-year costs for hospitalization and emergency department visits for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions. RESULTS: Among 991 445 participants, 156 296 (15.8%) had a mental health disorder. Those with no mental health disorder were older (mean [SD] age, 58.1 [17.6] years vs 55.4 [17.0] years; P < .001) and less likely to be women (50.4% [95% CI, 50.3%-50.5%] vs 57.7% [95% CI, 57.4%-58.0%]; P < .001) than those with mental health disorders. For those with a mental health disorder, mean total 3-year adjusted costs were $38 250 (95% CI, $36 476-$39 935), and for those without a mental health disorder, mean total 3-year adjusted costs were $22 280 (95% CI, $21 780-$22 760). Having a mental health disorder was associated with significantly higher resource use, including hospitalization and emergency department visit rates, length of stay, and hospitalization for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions. Higher resource use by patients with mental health disorders was not associated with health care presentations owing to chronic diseases compared with patients without a mental health disorder (chronic disease hospitalization rate per 1000 patient days, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.11-0.12] vs 0.06 [95% CI, 0.06-0.06]; P < .001; overall hospitalization rate per 1000 patient days, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.87-0.88] vs 0.43 [95% CI, 0.43-0.43]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that mental health disorders are associated with substantially higher resource utilization and health care costs among patients with chronic diseases. These findings have clinical and health policy implications.","['Sporinova, Barbora', 'Manns, Braden', 'Tonelli, Marcello', 'Hemmelgarn, Brenda', 'MacMaster, Frank', 'Mitchell, Nicholas', 'Au, Flora', 'Ma, Zhihai', 'Weaver, Robert', 'Quinn, Amity']","['Sporinova B', 'Manns B', 'Tonelli M', 'Hemmelgarn B', 'MacMaster F', 'Mitchell N', 'Au F', 'Ma Z', 'Weaver R', 'Quinn A']","['Department of Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Alberta Health Services, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', ""Libin Cardiovascular Institute, O'Brien Institute of Public Health, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."", 'Department of Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', ""Libin Cardiovascular Institute, O'Brien Institute of Public Health, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."", 'Department of Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', ""Libin Cardiovascular Institute, O'Brien Institute of Public Health, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."", 'Department of Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Strategic Clinical Network for Addictions and Mental Health, Alberta Health Services, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Strategic Clinical Network for Addictions and Mental Health, Alberta Health Services, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],['CIHR/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190802,United States,JAMA Netw Open,JAMA network open,101729235,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alberta/epidemiology', 'Ambulatory Care/economics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic Disease/*economics/epidemiology/psychology', 'Emergency Service, Hospital/economics', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs/statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitalization/economics', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay/economics', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*economics/psychology', 'Mental Health/*economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC6714022,,,,2019/08/24 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/08/24 06:00'],"['2019/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['2748662 [pii]', 'zoi190392 [pii]', '10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.9910 [doi]']",epublish,JAMA Netw Open. 2019 Aug 2;2(8):e199910. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.9910.,8,,,['Conflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of the current review is to summarize the evidence on the relationships between depressive and anxiety disorders, subjective mental health and common MSDs in adults aged 45 years and over. A review of studies published in English, identified using MEDLINE, was conducted. Search terms included spinal stenosis, intervertebral disc displacement, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, mental health, subjective well-being, subjective quality of life, life satisfaction and personal satisfaction. A total of 287 records were initially identified, and an additional 190 records were identified from their reference lists. Eight studies were considered eligible and were, thus, included in the current review. The included studies reported that: 1) major depressive disorder is associated with chronic back pain; 2) anxiety disorders are associated with cervical or lumbar disc herniation; 3) mood and anxiety disorders are associated with lower bone mineral density in men; 4) life satisfaction and its improvement prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women; and 5) quality of life reduces progressively as the number of osteoporotic fractures increases. In conclusion, common MSDs are associated with mental disorders and subjective mental health in adults aged 45 years or more, but longitudinal research is needed.","['Heikkinen, Jeremi', 'Honkanen, Risto', 'Williams, Lana', 'Leung, Janni', 'Rauma, Paivi', 'Quirk, Shae', 'Koivumaa-Honkanen, Heli']","['Heikkinen J', 'Honkanen R', 'Williams L', 'Leung J', 'Rauma P', 'Quirk S', 'Koivumaa-Honkanen H']","['Department of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Finland.

We investigated their research outputs during 2008-17 in the Web of Science in order to compare them with the burden from different mental health disorders and in different countries. The papers were identified with a complex filter based on title words and journals. Their addresses were parsed to give fractional country counts, show international collaboration, and also reveal country concentration on individual disorders and types of research. We found 17,920 papers in the decade, with output quadrupling. Foreign contributions accounted for 15% of addresses; they were from Europe (7%), Canada + USA (5%) and elsewhere (3%). They were much greater for Qatar and Uganda (> 60%), but less than 10% for Iran and Turkey. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were over-researched, but suicide and self-harm were seriously neglected, relative to their mental health disorder burdens. Although OIC research has been expanding rapidly, some countries have published little on this subject, perhaps because of stigma. Turkey collaborates relatively little internationally and as a result its papers received few citations.

In this article, we begin by providing a review of previous efforts to introduce this approach that date back more than 30 years. Next, we introduce changes proposed in the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood DC:0-5 (ZERO TO THREE, in press). In a major change from previous attempts, the DC:0-5 includes an Axis I ""Relationship Specific Disorder of Early Childhood."" This disorder intends to capture disordered behavior that is limited to one caregiver relationship rather than cross contextually. An axial characterization is continued from the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood DC:0-3R (ZERO TO THREE, 2005), but two major changes are introduced. First, the DC:0-5 proposes to simplify ratings of relationship adaptation/maladaptation, and to expand what is rated so that in addition to characterizing the child's relationship with his or her primary caregiver, there also is a characterization of the network of family relationships in which the child develops. This includes coparenting relationships and the entire network of close relationships that impinge on the young child's development and adaptation.","['Zeanah, Charles H', 'Lieberman, Alicia']","['Zeanah CH', 'Lieberman A']","['Tulane University School of Medicine. czeanah@tulane.edu.', 'University of California San Francisco.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20160830,United States,Infant Ment Health J,Infant mental health journal,8007859,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Developmental Disabilities/*classification/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Mental Disorders/classification/*diagnosis', 'Mental Health/classification', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Vocabulary, Controlled']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Beziehungspsychopathologie', 'Beziehungsstorungen', 'Eltern-Kind-Beziehung', 'infant mental health', 'parent-child relationship', 'psychische Gesundheit von Sauglingen', 'psychopathologie de la relation', 'relacion progenitor nino', 'relation parent enfant', 'relationship disorders', 'relationship psychopathology', 'salud mental infantil', 'sante mentale du nourrisson', 'sicopatologia de la relacion', 'trastornos en la relacion', 'trouble de la relation', '乳幼児精神保健', '幼兒心理健康', '親子関係性', '親子關係', '関係性精神病理', '関係性障害', '關係病理學', '關係障礙']",2016/08/31 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/08/31 06:00'],"['2016/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/imhj.21590 [doi]'],ppublish,Infant Ment Health J. 2016 Sep;37(5):509-20. doi: 10.1002/imhj.21590.

Thus, plasticity is not beneficial per se but its value depends on contextual factors, such as the quality of the living environment. High plasticity is beneficial in a favorable environment, but can be detrimental in adverse conditions, while the opposite applies to low plasticity. Resilience and vulnerability are not univocally associated to high or low plasticity. Consequently, individuals should undergo different preventive and therapeutic strategies according to their plasticity levels and living conditions. Here, an operationalization of plasticity relying on network theory is proposed: the strength of the connection among the network elements defining the individual, such as its symptoms, is a measure of plasticity. This theoretical framework represents a promising tool to investigate research questions related to changes in neural structure and activity and in behavior, and to improve therapeutic strategies for psychiatric disorders, such as major depression.","['Branchi, Igor']",['Branchi I'],"['Center for Behavioral Sciences and Mental Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.

While studies have suggested a structure including internalizing and externalizing disorders, less is known with regard to the cross-national stability of this model. Moreover, little data are available on the placement of eating disorders, bipolar disorder and psychotic experiences (PEs) in this structure. METHODS: We evaluated the structure of mental disorders with data from the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview, including 15 lifetime mental disorders and six PEs. Respondents (n = 5478-15 499) were included from 10 high-, middle- and lower middle-income countries across the world aged 18 years or older. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were used to evaluate and compare the fit of different factor structures to the lifetime disorder data. Measurement invariance was evaluated with multigroup CFA (MG-CFA). RESULTS: A second-order model with internalizing and externalizing factors and fear and distress subfactors best described the structure of common mental disorders. MG-CFA showed that this model was stable across countries. Of the uncommon disorders, bipolar disorder and eating disorder were best grouped with the internalizing factor, and PEs with a separate factor. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that cross-national patterns of lifetime common mental-disorder comorbidity can be explained with a second-order underlying structure that is stable across countries and can be extended to also cover less common mental disorders.","['de Jonge, Peter', 'Wardenaar, Klaas J', 'Lim, Carmen C W', 'Aguilar-Gaxiola, Sergio', 'Alonso, Jordi', 'Andrade, Laura Helena', 'Bunting, Brendan', 'Chatterji, Somnath', 'Ciutan, Marius', 'Gureje, Oye', 'Karam, Elie G', 'Lee, Sing', 'Medina-Mora, Maria Elena', 'Moskalewicz, Jacek', 'Navarro-Mateu, Fernando', 'Pennell, Beth-Ellen', 'Piazza, Marina', 'Posada-Villa, Jose', 'Torres, Yolanda', 'Kessler, Ronald C', 'Scott, Kate']","['de Jonge P', 'Wardenaar KJ', 'Lim CCW', 'Aguilar-Gaxiola S', 'Alonso J', 'Andrade LH', 'Bunting B', 'Chatterji S', 'Ciutan M', 'Gureje O', 'Karam EG', 'Lee S', 'Medina-Mora ME', 'Moskalewicz J', 'Navarro-Mateu F', 'Pennell BE', 'Piazza M', 'Posada-Villa J', 'Torres Y', 'Kessler RC', 'Scott K']","['Developmental Psychology,Department of Psychology,Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,Groningen,Netherlands.', 'Department of Psychiatry,Interdisciplinary Center Psychopathology and Emotion Regulation,University Medical Center Groningen,Groningen,Netherlands.', 'Department of Psychological Medicine,University of Otago,Dunedin, Otago,New Zealand.', 'Center for Reducing Health Disparities,UC Davis Health System,Sacramento, California,USA.', 'Health Services Research Unit,IMIM-Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute,Barcelona,Spain.', 'Nucleo de Epidemiologia Psiquiatrica - LIM 23,Instituto de Psiquiatria Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade,de Sao Paulo,Brazil.', 'School of Psychology,Ulster University,Londonderry,UK.', 'Department of Information,Evidence and Research, World Health Organization,Geneva,Switzerland.', 'National School of Public Health,Management and Development,Bucharest,Romania.', 'Department of Psychiatry,University College Hospital,Ibadan,Nigeria.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology,St George Hospital University Medical Center, Balamand University,Faculty of Medicine,Beirut,Lebanon.', 'Department of Psychiatry,Chinese University of Hong Kong,Tai Po,Hong Kong.', 'National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Muniz,Mexico City,Mexico.', 'Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology,Warsaw,Poland.', 'UDIF-SM, Subdireccion General de Planificacion, Innovacion y Cronicidad, Servicio Murciano de Salud; IMIB-Arrixaca; CIBERESP-Murcia,Murcia,Spain.', 'Survey Research Center,Institute for Social Research,University of Michigan,Ann Arbor, Michigan,USA.', 'Universidad Cayetano Heredia,Lima,Peru.', 'Colegio Mayor de Cundinamarca University, Faculty of Social Sciences,Bogota,Colombia.', 'Center for Excellence on Research in Mental Health, CES University,Medellin,Colombia.', 'Department of Health Care Policy,Harvard Medical School,Boston, Massachusetts,USA.', 'Department of Psychological Medicine,University of Otago,Dunedin, Otago,New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['R01 DA016558/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 TW006481/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH069864/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'K05 DA015799/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 MH060220/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH070884/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', '001/WHO_/World Health Organization/International', 'R13 MH066849/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171219,England,Psychol Med,Psychological medicine,1254142,IM,"['Adult', 'Global Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Interview, Psychological', '*Mental Disorders/classification/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', '*Models, Statistical', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales/*statistics & numerical data', 'World Health Organization']",PMC6008201,['NIHMS954741'],['NOTNLM'],"['comorbidity', 'epidemiology', 'mental disorders', 'psychiatric disorders']",2017/12/20 06:00,2019/05/06 06:00,['2017/12/20 06:00'],"['2017/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0033291717003610 [pii]', '10.1017/S0033291717003610 [doi]']",ppublish,Psychol Med. 2018 Sep;48(12):2073-2084. doi: 10.1017/S0033291717003610.

Its purpose is to identify the impact on mental health in Europe of the economic downturn and the measures that may be taken to respond to it. We performed a review of the existing literature that yields 350 articles on which our conclusions and recommendations are based. Evidence-based tables and recommendations were developed through an expert consensus process. Literature dealing with the consequences of economic turmoil on the health and health behaviours of the population is heterogeneous, and the results are not completely unequivocal. However, there is a broad consensus about the deleterious consequences of economic crises on mental health, particularly on psychological well-being, depression, anxiety disorders, insomnia, alcohol abuse, and suicidal behaviour. Unemployment, indebtedness, precarious working conditions, inequalities, lack of social connectedness, and housing instability emerge as main risk factors. Men at working age could be particularly at risk, together with previous low SES or stigmatized populations. Generalized austerity measures and poor developed welfare systems trend to increase the harmful effects of economic crises on mental health. Although many articles suggest limitations of existing research and provide suggestions for future research, there is relatively little discussion of policy approaches to address the negative impact of economic crises on mental health. The few studies that addressed policy questions suggested that the development of social protection programs such as active labour programs, social support systems, protection for housing instability, and better access to mental health care, particularly at primary care level, is strongly needed.","['Martin-Carrasco, M', 'Evans-Lacko, S', 'Dom, G', 'Christodoulou, N G', 'Samochowiec, J', 'Gonzalez-Fraile, E', 'Bienkowski, P', 'Gomez-Beneyto, M', 'Dos Santos, M J H', 'Wasserman, D']","['Martin-Carrasco M', 'Evans-Lacko S', 'Dom G', 'Christodoulou NG', 'Samochowiec J', 'Gonzalez-Fraile E', 'Bienkowski P', 'Gomez-Beneyto M', 'Dos Santos MJ', 'Wasserman D']","['Institute of Psychiatric Research, M feminine Josefa Recio Foundation (Hospitaller Sisters), Bilbao, Spain. martincarrasco.manuel@gmail.com.', 'Centro de Investigacion en Red Salud Mental (CIBERSAM), Madrid, Spain. martincarrasco.manuel@gmail.com.', 'Clinica Padre Menni, Department of Psychiatry, Joaquin Beunza, 45, 31014, Pamplona, Spain. martincarrasco.manuel@gmail.com.', ""Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, De Crespigny Park, London, UK."", 'PSSRU, London School of Economics and Political Science, Houghton Street, London, WC2A 2AE, UK.', 'Collaborative Antwerp Psychiatric Research Institute, Antwerp University, 2610, Wilrijk, Belgium.', 'University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Institute of Psychiatric Research, M feminine Josefa Recio Foundation (Hospitaller Sisters), Bilbao, Spain.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Centro de Investigacion en Red Salud Mental (CIBERSAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Portuguese Society of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Beatriz Angelo Hospital, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'National Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention of Mental Health, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160213,Germany,Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci,European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,9103030,IM,"['*Economic Recession', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*economics/*standards', '*Psychiatry/economics/methods/standards', 'Societies, Medical/*standards']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Depression', 'Economic crisis', 'Europe', 'Mental health', 'Psychiatric care', 'Suicide', 'Unemployment', 'Welfare system']",2016/02/15 06:00,2016/11/15 06:00,['2016/02/15 06:00'],"['2016/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00406-016-0681-x [pii]', '10.1007/s00406-016-0681-x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci. 2016 Mar;266(2):89-124. doi: 10.1007/s00406-016-0681-x.

Understanding patterns of comorbidity may be essential for the development of adequate treatment interventions. The present study aimed to assess the underlying structure of comorbidity between mental health and substance use disorders in prison populations. METHODS: Current mental disorders were assessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview in a cross-sectional observational study of 427 individuals consecutively committed to prison facilities in Santiago, Chile. Five alternative structural models were tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Latent class analysis of comorbid mental health and substance use disorders was carried out. RESULTS: CFA indicated the best fit for a bifactor model with a general psychopathology P factor and specific internalizing and externalizing factors. Borderline personality disorder loaded highest on the P factor (0.85). The latent comorbidity structure showed a four-class solution representing one class without relevant comorbidities (48% prevalence) and three classes representing the following comorbidities: (1) externalizing disorders including substance use and antisocial personality disorder (31%), (2) internalizing disorders including anxiety disorders (10%), and (3) all types of disorders co-occurring (11%). Major depression and borderline personality disorder were present across all three latent classes of comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Prison mental health services need to serve a highly comorbid population. Specific approaches may be useful for an externalizing and an internalizing spectrum of disorders. An important group of individuals with all types of mental disorders co-occurring may need new approaches in treatment development.","['Ignatyev, Yuriy', 'Baggio, Stephanie', 'Mundt, Adrian P']","['Ignatyev Y', 'Baggio S', 'Mundt AP']","['Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Immanuel Klinik, Brandenburg Medical School Theodor Fontane, Rudersdorf, Germany.', 'Division of Prison Health, Geneva University Hospitals and University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Medical Faculty, Universidad Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile, adrian.mundt@mail.udp.cl.', 'Medical School, Universidad San Sebastian, Puerto Montt, Chile, adrian.mundt@mail.udp.cl.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190117,Switzerland,Psychopathology,Psychopathology,8401537,,"['Adult', 'Comorbidity/*trends', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Prevalence', 'Prisons/*standards', 'Substance-Related Disorders/*psychology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bifactor', 'Comorbidity', 'Externalizing/internalizing', 'Mental health', 'Prison']",2019/01/18 06:00,2019/08/07 06:00,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['000495844 [pii]', '10.1159/000495844 [doi]']",ppublish,Psychopathology. 2019;52(1):2-9. doi: 10.1159/000495844.

Although the structured data are used for reporting purposes, the free text remains untapped for DV reporting and surveillance purposes. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we explore whether text mining can automatically identify mental health disorders from this unstructured text. METHODS: We used a training set of 200 DV recorded events to design a knowledge-driven approach based on lexical patterns in text suggesting mental health disorders for POIs and victims. RESULTS: The precision returned from an evaluation set of 100 DV events was 97.5% and 87.1% for mental health disorders related to POIs and victims, respectively. After applying our approach to a large-scale corpus of almost a half million DV events, we identified 77,995 events (15.83%) that mentioned mental health disorders, with 76.96% (60,032/77,995) of those linked to POIs versus 16.47% (12,852/77,995) for the victims and 6.55% (5111/77,995) for both. Depression was the most common mental health disorder mentioned in both victims (22.25%, 3269) and POIs (18.70%, 8944), followed by alcohol abuse for POIs (12.19%, 5829) and various anxiety disorders (eg, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder) for victims (11.66%, 1714). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that text mining can automatically extract targeted information from police-recorded DV events to support further public health research into the nexus between mental health disorders and DV.","['Karystianis, George', 'Adily, Armita', 'Schofield, Peter', 'Knight, Lee', 'Galdon, Clara', 'Greenberg, David', 'Jorm, Louisa', 'Nenadic, Goran', 'Butler, Tony']","['Karystianis G', 'Adily A', 'Schofield P', 'Knight L', 'Galdon C', 'Greenberg D', 'Jorm L', 'Nenadic G', 'Butler T']","['Kirby Institute, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.', 'Kirby Institute, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.', 'Neuropsychiatry Service, Hunter New England Health, Newcastle, Australia.', 'Kirby Institute, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.', 'Victims Services, New South Wales Department of Justice, Sydney, Australia.', 'School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.', 'Centre for Big Data Research in Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.', 'School of Computer Science, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Kirby Institute, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['MC_PC_13042/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/K006665/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180913,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,IM,"['Adult', 'Data Mining/*methods', 'Domestic Violence/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Narration', 'Police']",PMC6231811,,['NOTNLM'],"['domestic violence', 'mental health disorders', 'police narratives', 'rule-based approach', 'text mining']",2018/09/15 06:00,2019/08/31 06:00,['2018/09/15 06:00'],"['2018/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['v20i9e11548 [pii]', '10.2196/11548 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2018 Sep 13;20(9):e11548. doi: 10.2196/11548.,9,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3491-361X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0722-3293', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2967-9662', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1832-8544', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9172-8261', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8658-2352', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0390-661X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0795-5363', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2679-2769']",,['Conflicts of Interest: None declared.'],"['(c)George Karystianis, Armita Adily, Peter Schofield, Lee Knight, Clara Galdon,', 'David Greenberg, Louisa Jorm, Goran Nenadic, Tony Butler.

However, none have examined the relationships between DSM-IV Axis II mental health disorders (A2s) and risky sexual behaviors. A2 disorders are a poorly understood, yet prevalent and disabling class of mental health conditions. They develop early in life through an interaction of genetics and environment, and are persistent across the life course. Common features include poor impulse control, addiction, social isolation, and elevated sexual desires, although the defining features vary substantially across disorder. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To investigate the association between A2 disorders and three measures of risky sexual behavior. METHODS: We obtain data on adults age 20 to 50 years from Wave II of the National Epidemiological Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Our outcome measures include early initiation into sexual activity, and past year regular use of alcohol before sex and sexually transmitted disease diagnosis. NESARC administrators use the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule to classify respondents as meeting criteria for the ten A2 disorders recognized by the American Psychiatric Association. We construct several measures of A2 disorders based on the NESARC administrators' classifications. Given their comorbidity with A2 disorders, we explore the importance of Axis I disorders in the estimated associations. RESULTS: We find that A2 disorders are generally associated with an increase in the probability of risky sexual behaviors among both men and women. In specifications that disaggregate disorders into clusters and specific conditions, the significant associations are not uniform, but are broadly consistent with the defining features of the cluster or disorder. Inclusion of A1 disorders attenuates estimated associations for some risky sexual behaviors among men, but not for women. DISCUSSION: We find positive associations between A2 disorders and our measures of risky sexual behaviors. Our findings are subject to several data limitations, however. The NESARC lacks information on more advanced risky sexual behaviors and our measure of early initiation into sexual activity is retrospective. Identifying the causal effects of mental health and risky sexual behaviors is complicated due to bias from reverse causality and omitted variables. We believe these sources of bias are less of a concern in our study, however. Specifically, A2 disorders develop early in life and pre-date the risky sexual behaviors, thus negating reverse causality. Because the NESARC contains a rich set of personal characteristics, we are also able to minimize potential omitted variable bias. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVISION AND USE: A2 disorders are significantly associated with risky sexual behaviors, which could lead to greater utilization and cost of health care services. IMPLICATION FOR HEALTH POLICIES: Health care providers should consider A2 disorders when developing health promotion recommendations as these disorders may place individuals at elevated risk for unsafe sexual behaviors. IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Future studies should examine the causal mechanisms between A2 disorders and risky sexual behaviors.","['Maclean, Johanna Catherine', 'Xu, Haiyong', 'French, Michael T', 'Ettner, Susan L']","['Maclean JC', 'Xu H', 'French MT', 'Ettner SL']","['Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania; 1316 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia PA, 19104, USA, macleanc@upenn.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Italy,J Ment Health Policy Econ,The journal of mental health policy and economics,9815374,IM,"['Adult', 'Alcohol Drinking/*epidemiology', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/classification/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Personality Disorders/classification/*epidemiology', '*Risk-Taking', 'Sex Factors', 'Sexual Behavior/classification/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2014/02/15 06:00,2014/03/08 06:00,['2014/02/15 06:00'],"['2013/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Ment Health Policy Econ. 2013 Dec;16(4):187-208.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study identifies common mental health diagnostic profiles among participants of MOVE!-the Veterans Health Administration's behavioral weight loss program. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used national VHA administrative data from fiscal year 2014 to identify veteran primary care patients who participated in at least one MOVE! session the previous year (n = 110,830). Using latent class analysis, we identified patient types (classes) characterized by the presence or absence of mental health diagnoses, both overall and stratified by age and gender. RESULTS: There were several patient types (classes), including psychologically healthy, predominantly depressed, depressed with co-occurring mental disorders, and co-occurring mental disorders with no predominant psychological condition. Additional patient types were found in men of different ages. The majority of patients had at least one psychiatric disorder, particularly younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve patients' engagement in the MOVE! program may need to address barriers to care associated with mental health disorders or incorporate care for both obesity and mental health diagnoses in MOVE! A holistic approach may be particularly important for younger patients who have a higher comorbidity burden and longer care horizons. Future work may address if patient types found in the current study extend to non-VHA obesity treatment seekers.","['Hayes, Jacqueline F', 'Hoggatt, Katherine J', 'Breland, Jessica Y']","['Hayes JF', 'Hoggatt KJ', 'Breland JY']","['VA HSR&D Center for Innovation to Implementation, VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Menlo Park, CA 94025.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Alpert School of Medicine, Brown University, Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center, The Miriam Hospital, 196 Richmond Street, Providence, RI 02903.', 'VA HSR&D Center for the Study of Healthcare Innovation, Implementation and Policy, VA San Francisco Healthcare System, San Francisco, CA, 94121.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, 94143.', 'VA HSR&D Center for Innovation to Implementation, VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Menlo Park, CA 94025.']",['eng'],"['CDA 15-257/VA/VA/United States', 'IK2 HX002125/HX/HSRD VA/United States', 'T32 HL076134/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Mil Med,Military medicine,2984771R,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mental Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'United States/epidemiology', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans/*psychology', '*Weight Loss', '*Weight Reduction Programs']",PMC7643125,,,,2020/04/25 06:00,2021/03/04 06:00,['2020/04/25 06:00'],"['2019/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['5824384 [pii]', 'usaa046 [pii]', '10.1093/milmed/usaa046 [doi]']",ppublish,Mil Med. 2020 Aug 14;185(7-8):e1263-e1270. doi: 10.1093/milmed/usaa046.,7-8,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES), 2001-2003, a national household probability sample. The study enrolled 18,237 individuals who were either Non-Hispanic White (n = 7587), African American (n = 4746), Mexican (n = 1442), Cuban (n = 577), Puerto Rican (n = 495), Other Hispanic (n = 1106), Vietnamese (n = 520), Filipino (n = 508), Chinese (n = 600) or Other Asian (n = 656). SRMH was the outcome. Independent variables were psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder [MDD], general anxiety disorder [GAD], social phobia, alcohol abuse, binge eating disorders, panic disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], measured by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Demographic (age and gender) and socioeconomic (education and income) factors were covariates. RESULTS: The only psychiatric disorder which was universally associated with SRMH across all ethnic groups was MDD. More psychiatric disorders were associated with poor SRMH in Non-Hispanic Whites than any other ethnic groups. Among African Americans, demographic and socioeconomic factors could fully explain the associations between psychiatric disorders and SRMH. Among Mexican and Other Hispanics, demographic and socioeconomic factors could only explain the association between some but not all psychiatric disorders and SRMH. In all other ethnic groups, demographic and socioeconomic factors did not explain the link between psychiatric disorders and SRMH. CONCLUSION: Although SRMH is a useful tool for estimation of mental health needs of populations, poor SRMH may not have universal meanings across ethnically diverse populations. Ethnic groups differ in how their poor SRMH reflects psychiatric conditions and the role of demographic and socioeconomic factors in explaining such links. These ethnic differences may be a source of measurement bias in cross-ethnic health comparisons.","['Assari, Shervin']",['Assari S'],"['Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. assari@umich.edu.', 'Center for Research on Ethnicity, Culture and Health, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. assari@umich.edu.', 'Health Behavior and Health Education, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, 1415 Washington Heights, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2029, USA. assari@umich.edu.']",['eng'],"['U01 MH062207/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 MH060220/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 MH057716/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 MH058565/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 MH062209/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170914,Switzerland,J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,101628476,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Ethnicity/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*psychology', 'Mental Health/*ethnology', 'Middle Aged', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",PMC6378222,['NIHMS906483'],['NOTNLM'],"['Ethnic groups', 'Psychiatric disorders', 'Self-rated health']",2017/09/16 06:00,2019/10/08 06:00,['2017/09/16 06:00'],"['2016/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/09/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40615-017-0417-2 [pii]', '10.1007/s40615-017-0417-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Racial Ethn Health Disparities. 2018 Aug;5(4):728-736. doi: 10.1007/s40615-017-0417-2.

AIMS: The aim was to link two different literatures which have remained apart. METHODS: In all, 186 young British participants (52% male) with an average age of 25 years completed an online questionnaire describing six vignettes characters. Three described mental health conditions (anorexia, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) and three physical health conditions (asthma, diabetes and osteoarthritis). Participants were required to name the illness and rate how treatable and manageable they believed the condition is. They were also asked to rate how much the problem would affect an individual's daily life and suggest whether the individual should seek professional help. RESULTS: The recognition of specific mental health conditions (anorexia, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia) was marginally higher than the recognition of physical health conditions (arthritis, asthma, diabetes). Ratings about treatment and the effect of each illness showed considerable variation. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that people are equally and relatively poorly informed about relatively common mental compared to physical illnesses.","['Vimalanathan, Adshara', 'Furnham, Adrian']","['Vimalanathan A', 'Furnham A']","['a Research Department of Clinical , Educational and Health Psychology, University College London , London , UK and.', 'a Research Department of Clinical , Educational and Health Psychology, University College London , London , UK and.', 'b Norwegian Business School (BI) , Nydalveien , Olso , Norway.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180427,England,J Ment Health,"Journal of mental health (Abingdon, England)",9212352,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', '*Health Literacy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/psychology', 'Mental Health/*education', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mental health literacy', 'anorexia', 'asthma', 'bi-polar', 'diabetes', 'osteoarthritis', 'physical health literacy', 'schizophrenia']",2018/04/28 06:00,2019/11/19 06:00,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2018/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09638237.2018.1466050 [doi]'],ppublish,J Ment Health. 2019 Jun;28(3):243-248. doi: 10.1080/09638237.2018.1466050.

Concerning mental health, World Health Organization emphasizes that ""Mental Health is more than mental disorders. It is a state of well-being that includes using one's own abilities, self-realization, coping with the stresses in the natural flow of life, learning to be well and trying to heal, working efficiently and contributing to the society in which they live."" (World Health Organization 2022a). It has been reported that the disease burden of common mental disorders (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychoactive substance use disorders, suicide, etc.) is gradually increasing (World Health Organization 2021). Especially in the last century, the importance and seriousness of endemic and pandemic events (HIV, SARS virus, and still continuing Covid-19, etc.) or non-communicable diseases (cancer, heart diseases, diabetes, etc.), climate changes, economic, socio-political dynamics and wars are noteworthy as a predisposition and/or precipitating factors in terms of mental health (World Health Organization 2022a, World Health Organization 2022b). Protection and improvement of mental health, together with individual, social, and structural mental health determinants, predict interventions that reduce risks, increase resilience, and create a supportive environment for mental health. These interventions are recommended to be designed individually, in a way to be disseminated to special groups across the community. Globally, one person dies by suicide every 40 seconds, and more than 18 million health workers are needed in terms of human resources.","['Hallac, Saliha', 'Kaya, Burhanettin']","['Hallac S', 'Kaya B']",,"['eng', 'tur']",,['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Turk Psikiyatri Derg,Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry,9425936,IM,"['Humans', 'Mental Health', '*COVID-19', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Anxiety']",,,,,2023/01/03 06:00,2023/01/05 06:00,['2023/01/02 09:23'],"['2023/01/02 09:23 [entrez]', '2023/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1322 [pii]', '10.5080/u27236 [doi]']",ppublish,Turk Psikiyatri Derg. 2022 Winter;33(4):293-294. doi: 10.5080/u27236.,4,,,,,"ISBIRLIGINE DAYALI, ENTEGRE BIR RUH SAGLIGI YAKLASIMI: ""KADEMELI BAKIM MODELI"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They increase over time and impose a severe burden on individuals and societies. OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the evolution of mental health over a period of 15 years, paying special attention on the impact of the most recent economic downturn and subsequent recovery, in Spain. METHOD: We use data coming from the National Health Surveys of 2006/2007, 2011/2012 and 2016/2017. Mental health is proxied by two measures, doctor-diagnosed mental disorder and psychological distress (based on the 12-item General Health Questionnaire). To account for the relationship between the two mental health indicators, we estimate a bivariate probit model. The potential endogeneity of unemployment status is considered. RESULTS: We observe different patterns of the two mental health indicators over time. Psychological distress in men increased during recession years, but slightly decreased among women. Diagnosed mental disorders declined during the peak years of the crisis. Unemployment is a major risk factor for mental distress. Irrespective of the economic conditions, belonging to a higher social class acts as a buffer against psychological distress for women, but not for men. The remaining determinants acted as expected. Women declared worse psychological health than men, and were also more often diagnosed with mental disorders. Having a partner had a protective impact, while providing intensive care to a dependent relative exerted the opposite effect. Education acted as buffer against the onset of psychological distress in women. CONCLUSION: Even though the need for mental healthcare increased during the recession, the fact that fewer people were diagnosed suggests that barriers to accessing mental healthcare may be aggravated during the crisis. Policies aiming to tackle the challenges posed by the high prevalence of mental disorders have to be particularly attentive to changes in individuals' socioeconomic situation, including education, unemployment and social class.","['Stoyanova, Alexandrina', 'Pinilla, Jaime']","['Stoyanova A', 'Pinilla J']","['Department of Economics, Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Universitat de Barcelona, BEAT and CAEPS, 08034, Barcelona, Spain. alexandrina.stoyanova@ub.edu.', 'Department of Quantitative Methods in Economics, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 35017, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.']",['eng'],"['162PR19693/Fundacion Ramon Areces/International', 'ECO2016-78991-R/Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de', 'Espana/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Applied health economics and health policy,101150314,IM,"['*Economic Recession', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*trends', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Stress, Psychological/epidemiology', '*Unemployment']",,,,,2019/11/26 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2019/11/26 06:00'],"['2019/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40258-019-00537-9 [pii]', '10.1007/s40258-019-00537-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2020 Apr;18(2):203-221. doi: 10.1007/s40258-019-00537-9.,2,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3238-0055', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7126-4236']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The goal was to determine whether comorbid depression and/or anxiety influence outcomes after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for patients with degenerative cervical pathology. BACKGROUND DATA: The role preoperative mental health has on patient reported outcomes after ACDF surgery is not well understood. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective ACDF for degenerative cervical pathology were identified. Patients were grouped based on their preoperative mental health comorbidities, including patients with no history, depression, anxiety, and those with both depression and anxiety. All preoperative medical treatment for depression and/or anxiety was identified. Outcomes including Physical Component Score (PCS-12), Mental Component Score (MCS-12), Neck Disability Index (NDI), Visual Analogue Scale neck pain score (VAS Neck ), and Visual Analogue Scale arm pain score (VAS Arm) were compared between groups from baseline to postoperative measurements using multiple linear regression analysis-controlling for factors such as age, sex, and body mass index, etc. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 264 patients were included in the analysis, with an average age of 53 years and mean follow-up of 19.8 months (19.0-20.6). All patients with a diagnosis of depression or anxiety also reported medical treatment for the disease. The group with no depression or anxiety had significantly less baseline disability than the group with 2 mental health diagnoses, in MCS-12 (P=0.009), NDI (P<0.004), VAS Neck (P=0.003), and VAS Arm (P=0.001) scores. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that increasing occurrence of mental health disorders was not a significant predictor of change over time for any of the outcome measures included in the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite more severe preoperative symptoms, patients with a preoperative mental health disorder(s) demonstrated significant improvement in postoperative outcomes after ACDF. No differences were identified in postoperative outcomes between each of the groups.

Mental health research on refugees and asylum seekers has burgeoned over the past two decades with epidemiological studies, accounts of the lived experience, new conceptual frameworks, and advances in understanding of effective treatment and intervention. However, there are substantial gaps in available research, and important ethical and methodological challenges. These include: the need to adopt decolonizing, participatory methods that amplify refugee voices; the further development of frameworks for studying the broad impacts of forced migration that go beyond posttraumatic stress disorder; and more translational research informed by longitudinal studies of the course of refugee adaptation. Keeping a human rights advocacy perspective front and center will allow researchers to work in collaborative ways with both refugee communities and receiving societies to develop innovative mental health policy and practice to meet the urgent need for a global response to the challenge of forced migration, which is likely to grow dramatically in the coming years as a result of the impacts of climate change.","['Kronick, Rachel', 'Jarvis, G Eric', 'Kirmayer, Laurence J']","['Kronick R', 'Jarvis GE', 'Kirmayer LJ']","['McGill University.', 'McGill University.', 'McGill University.']",['eng'],,['Editorial'],,England,Transcult Psychiatry,Transcultural psychiatry,9708119,IM,"['Human Rights', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Refugees', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['advocacy', 'cultural psychiatry', 'human rights', 'refugee mental health']",2021/04/01 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2021/03/31 05:34'],"['2021/03/31 05:34 [entrez]', '2021/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/13634615211002690 [doi]'],ppublish,Transcult Psychiatry. 2021 Apr;58(2):147-156. doi: 10.1177/13634615211002690.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, despite the availability of effective treatments, very few individuals with eating disorders seek treatment. Training in mental health first aid is known to be effective in increasing mental health literacy and supportive behaviours, in the social networks of individuals with mental health problems. Increases in these domains are thought to improve the likelihood that effective help is sought. However, the efficacy of mental health first aid for eating disorders has not been evaluated. The aim of this research was to examine whether specific training in mental health first aid for eating disorders was effective in changing knowledge, attitudes and behaviours towards people with eating disorders. METHODS: A repeated measures, uncontrolled trial was conducted to establish proof of concept and provide guidance on the future design of a randomised controlled trial. Self-report questionnaires, administered at baseline, post-training and 6-month follow-up, assessed the effectiveness of the 4-hour, single session, mental health first aid training. RESULTS: 73 participants completed the training and all questionnaires. The training intervention was associated with statistically significant increases in problem recognition and knowledge of appropriate mental health first aid strategies, which were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Sustained significant changes in attitudes and behaviours were less clear. 20 participants reported providing assistance to someone with a suspected eating disorder, seven of whom sought professional help as a result of the first aid interaction. Results provided no evidence of a negative impact on participants or the individuals they provided assistance to. CONCLUSIONS: This research provides preliminary evidence for the use of training in mental health first aid as a suitable intervention for increasing community knowledge of and support for people with eating disorders to seek appropriate help.

The consequence is a small availability of data and an absence of a real epidemiological profile. METHODS: This is a systematic review with meta-analysis, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol, in the period from 2003 to 2015, using the databases LILACS, SciELO and BVS. The analysis comprised the keywords 'models of primary and secondary healthcare in mental health', 'psychiatric reform' and 'policies and services in mental health', using the Boolean operator '# AND'. Original texts based on secondary data from the Hospital Information System of the Brazilian Unified Health System were also included via the Citizen Electronic Record System, Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica, and Ministry of Health. Grey literature was used by means of hand searching. RESULTS: A combined analysis of the strategies mentioned in the analyzed articles shows a combined odds ratio of 1.291 (confidence interval (CI) = 1.054-1.582), thus it demonstrates the efficacy of using such strategies in the elaboration of institutional apparatus in mental health. The p-value of the chi-square distribution resulted in .9753, which does not reject the hypothesis of association between strategies in mental health and possible development of institutional apparatus in mental health. CONCLUSIONS: A combined analysis of all strategies mentioned in the analyzed studies shows efficacy of using strategies to elaborate institutional apparatus in mental health.","['Januario, Sonilde Saraiva', 'das Neves Peixoto, Florido Sampaio', 'Lima, Nadia Nara Rolim', 'do Nascimento, Vania Barbosa', 'de Sousa, Danilo Ferreira', 'Pereira Luz, Dayse Christina Rodrigues', 'da Silva, Claudio Gleidiston Lima', 'Rolim Neto, Modesto Leite']","['Januario SS', 'das Neves Peixoto FS', 'Lima NN', 'do Nascimento VB', 'de Sousa DF', 'Pereira Luz DC', 'da Silva CG', 'Rolim Neto ML']","['1 Faculty of Medicine of ABC (FMABC), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', '1 Faculty of Medicine of ABC (FMABC), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', '1 Faculty of Medicine of ABC (FMABC), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', '1 Faculty of Medicine of ABC (FMABC), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', '2 Faculty of Juazeiro do Norte (FJN), Juazeiro do Norte, Brazil.', '1 Faculty of Medicine of ABC (FMABC), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', '2 Faculty of Juazeiro do Norte (FJN), Juazeiro do Norte, Brazil.', '3 Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Cariri (UFCA), Barbalha, Brazil.', '1 Faculty of Medicine of ABC (FMABC), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', '3 Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Cariri (UFCA), Barbalha, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20161213,England,Int J Soc Psychiatry,The International journal of social psychiatry,0374726,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brazil', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*legislation & jurisprudence/standards', '*Mental Health Services', 'Public Policy/*legislation & jurisprudence']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mental health', 'public policies', 'the Northeast of Brazil']",2017/02/01 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2017/02/01 06:00'],"['2017/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/0020764016677557 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Soc Psychiatry. 2017 Feb;63(1):21-32. doi: 10.1177/0020764016677557.

Stigmatizing attitudes remain widespread among healthcare professionals who are responsible for delivering patient-centered, quality care. Stigma in the healthcare setting can undermine effective diagnosis, therapy, and optimum health outcomes. Addressing stigma is critical to delivering quality health care in both developed and developing countries. Therefore, it is important to deliver successful anti-stigma education, along with practical strategies, to reduce the stigma of mental health disorders among healthcare professionals.

Digital storytelling is one method that has been used to capture people's lived experience. In this scoping review, we were interested in mapping how digital storytelling has been used in mental health, and to identify gaps in the literature. Nine databases were searched to identify peer reviewed literature published between January 2000 and August 2015; 15 articles were included in the review. The articles were categorized across four broad areas: educational interventions, learning skills, learning about other people's lived experience, and learning about personal lived experience. We identify that while digital storytelling has potential as a participatory process to promote mutual understanding of and empathy towards lived experiences in mental health, there is a dearth of research in this area. More research is needed on the use of digital storytelling in mental health to determine its effectiveness in progressing a recovery orientation in service provision that is built on solidarity and a social justice agenda.","['De Vecchi, Nadia', 'Kenny, Amanda', 'Dickson-Swift, Virginia', 'Kidd, Susan']","['De Vecchi N', 'Kenny A', 'Dickson-Swift V', 'Kidd S']","['La Trobe Rural Health School, College of Science, Health, and Engineering, La Trobe University, Bendigo, Victoria, Australia.', 'Bendigo Health, Psychiatric Services, Bendigo, Victoria, Australia.', 'La Trobe Rural Health School, College of Science, Health, and Engineering, La Trobe University, Bendigo, Victoria, Australia.', 'La Trobe Rural Health School, College of Science, Health, and Engineering, La Trobe University, Bendigo, Victoria, Australia.', 'La Trobe Rural Health School, College of Science, Health, and Engineering, La Trobe University, Bendigo, Victoria, Australia.', 'Bendigo Health, Psychiatric Services, Bendigo, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160221,Australia,Int J Ment Health Nurs,International journal of mental health nursing,101140527,,"['Empathy', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/psychology/therapy', 'Mental Health/*education', 'Narration', 'Narrative Therapy/*methods']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['digital storytelling', 'education', 'lived experience', 'mental health', 'review', 'stories']",2016/02/24 06:00,2017/05/26 06:00,['2016/02/23 06:00'],"['2015/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/inm.12206 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Ment Health Nurs. 2016 Jun;25(3):183-93. doi: 10.1111/inm.12206.

However, the advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has provided researchers with a novel toolbox. We conducted a systematic review using the PRISMA statement. A PubMed and Web of Science online search was performed (studies published between 2006-2020) using the following search strategy: hiPSC OR iPSC OR iPS OR stem cells AND schizophrenia disorder OR personality disorder OR antisocial personality disorder OR psychopathy OR bipolar disorder OR major depressive disorder OR obsessive compulsive disorder OR anxiety disorder OR substance use disorder OR alcohol use disorder OR nicotine use disorder OR opioid use disorder OR eating disorder OR anorexia nervosa OR attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder OR gaming disorder. Using the above search criteria, a total of 3515 studies were found. After screening, a final total of 56 studies were deemed eligible for inclusion in our study. Using iPSC technology, psychiatric disease can be studied in the context of a patient's own unique genetic background. This has allowed great strides to be made into uncovering the etiology of psychiatric disease, as well as providing a unique paradigm for drug testing. However, there is a lack of data for certain psychiatric disorders and several limitations to present iPSC-based studies, leading us to discuss how this field may progress in the next years to increase its utility in the battle to understand psychiatric disease.","['McNeill, Rhiannon V', 'Ziegler, Georg C', 'Radtke, Franziska', 'Nieberler, Matthias', 'Lesch, Klaus-Peter', 'Kittel-Schneider, Sarah']","['McNeill RV', 'Ziegler GC', 'Radtke F', 'Nieberler M', 'Lesch KP', 'Kittel-Schneider S']","['Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital, University of Wurzburg, Margarete-Hoppel-Platz 1, 97080, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital, University of Wurzburg, Margarete-Hoppel-Platz 1, 97080, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy University Hospital, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital, University of Wurzburg, Margarete-Hoppel-Platz 1, 97080, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital, University of Wurzburg, Margarete-Hoppel-Platz 1, 97080, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital, University of Wurzburg, Margarete-Hoppel-Platz 1, 97080, Wurzburg, Germany. kittel_s@ukw.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20200507,Austria,J Neural Transm (Vienna),"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",9702341,IM,"['*Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity', '*Bipolar Disorder', '*Depressive Disorder, Major', 'Humans', '*Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells', '*Mental Disorders', 'Mental Health', '*Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder']",PMC7578166,,['NOTNLM'],"['ADHD', 'Affective disorders', 'Mental disorders', 'Stem cells', 'hiPSC', 'iPSC']",2020/05/08 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2020/05/08 06:00'],"['2020/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00702-020-02197-9 [pii]', '2197 [pii]', '10.1007/s00702-020-02197-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neural Transm (Vienna). 2020 Nov;127(11):1547-1568. doi: 10.1007/s00702-020-02197-9.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess psychiatric comorbidity and health service utilization for mental problems among people living with HIV/AIDS in Iran. METHODS: A total of 250 cases were randomly selected from a large referral center for HIV treatment and care in Tehran, Iran. Psychiatric disorders in the past 12 months including mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders were assessed through face-to-face interview, using a validated Persian translation of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI v2.1). Severity of psychiatric disorders, social support, socio-economic status, service utilization and HIV-related indicators were assessed. RESULTS: Participants consisted of 147 men and 103 women. Psychiatric disorders were found in 50.2% (95% confidence interval: 43.8-56.6) of the participants. Major depressive disorder was the most prevalent diagnosis (32.1%), followed by substance use disorders (17.1%). In bivariate analysis, psychiatric disorders were significantly higher among male gender, single and unemployed individuals and those with lower social support. In multivariate regression analysis, only social support was independently associated with psychiatric disorders. Among those with a psychiatric diagnosis, 41.1% had used a health service for mental problems and 53% had received minimally adequate treatment. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study highlight the importance of mental health services in the treatment of people living with HIV/AIDS.","['Shadloo, Behrang', 'Amin-Esmaeili, Masoumeh', 'Motevalian, Abbas', 'Mohraz, Minoo', 'Sedaghat, Abbas', 'Gouya, Mohammad Mehdi', 'Rahimi-Movaghar, Afarin']","['Shadloo B', 'Amin-Esmaeili M', 'Motevalian A', 'Mohraz M', 'Sedaghat A', 'Gouya MM', 'Rahimi-Movaghar A']","['Iranian National Center for Addiction Studies (INCAS), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Iranian National Center for Addiction Studies (INCAS), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

Assessing overdiagnosis in mental health requires a consistently applied definition that differentiates overdiagnosis from other problems (e.g., misdiagnosis), as well as methods for quantification. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to (1) describe how the term ""overdiagnosis"" has been defined explicitly or implicitly in published articles on mental disorders, including usages consistent (overdefinition, overdetection) and inconsistent (misdiagnosis, false-positive test results, overtreatment, overtesting) with accepted definitions of overdiagnosis; and (2) identify examples of attempts to quantify overdiagnosis. METHOD: We searchedPubMed through January 5, 2019. Articles on mental disorders, excluding neurocognitive disorders, were eligible if they usedthe term ""overdiagnosis"" in the title, abstract, or text. RESULTS: We identified 164 eligible articles with 193 total explicit or implicit uses of the term ""overdiagnosis."" Of 9 articles with an explicit definition, only one provided a definition that was partially consistent with accepted definitions. Of all uses, 11.4% were consistent, and 76.7% were related to misdiagnosis and thus inconsistent. No attempts to quantify the proportion of patients who were overdiagnosed based on overdetection or overdefinition were identified. CONCLUSIONS: There are few examples of mental health articles that describe overdiagnosis consistent with accepted definitions and no examples of quantifying overdiagnosis based on these definitions. A definition of overdiagnosis based on diagnostic criteria that include people with transient or mild symptoms not amenable to treatment (overdefinition) could be used to quantify the extent of overdiagnosis in mental disorders.","['Thombs, Brett', 'Turner, Kimberly A', 'Shrier, Ian']","['Thombs B', 'Turner KA', 'Shrier I']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, brett.thombs@mcgill.ca.', 'Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, brett.thombs@mcgill.ca.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, brett.thombs@mcgill.ca.', 'Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, brett.thombs@mcgill.ca.', 'Department of Psychology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, brett.thombs@mcgill.ca.', 'Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, brett.thombs@mcgill.ca.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",20190724,Switzerland,Psychother Psychosom,Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,0024046,IM,"['Humans', '*Medical Overuse/statistics & numerical data', 'Mental Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Diagnosis', 'Medicalization', 'Mental disorders', 'Overdiagnosis', 'Psychiatry']",2019/07/25 06:00,2020/03/27 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['000501647 [pii]', '10.1159/000501647 [doi]']",ppublish,Psychother Psychosom. 2019;88(4):193-202. doi: 10.1159/000501647.

However, there is little information regarding the health state utility values of such disorders according to their clinical severity using comparable instruments across all disorders. This study reports utility values for high prevalence mental disorders using data from the 2007 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (NSMHWB). METHODS: Utility values were derived from the AQoL-4D and analysed by disorder classification (affective only (AD), anxiety-related only (ANX), substance use only (SUB) plus four comorbidity groups), severity level (mild, moderate, severe), symptom recency (reported in the past 30 days), and comorbidity (combination of disorders). The adjusted Wald test was applied to detect statistically significant differences of weighted means and the magnitude of difference between groups was presented as a modified Cohen's d. RESULTS: In total, 1526 individuals met criteria for a 12-month mental disorder. The mean utility value was 0.67 (SD = 0.27), with lower utility values associated with higher severity levels and some comorbidities. Utility values for AD, ANX and SUB were 0.64 (SD = 0.25), 0.71 (SD = 0.25) and 0.81 (SD = 0.19), respectively. No differences in utility values were observed between disorders within disorder groups. Utility values were significantly lower among people with recent symptoms (within past 30 days) than those without; when examined by diagnostic group, this pattern held for people with SUB, but not for people with ANX or AD. CONCLUSIONS: Health state utility values of people with high prevalence mental disorders differ significantly by severity level, number of mental health comorbidities and the recency of symptoms, which provide new insights on the burden associated with high prevalence mental disorders in Australia. The derived utility values can be used to populate future economic models.","['Mihalopoulos, Cathrine', 'Engel, Lidia', 'Le, Long Khanh-Dao', 'Magnus, Anne', 'Harris, Meredith', 'Chatterton, Mary Lou']","['Mihalopoulos C', 'Engel L', 'Le LK', 'Magnus A', 'Harris M', 'Chatterton ML']","['School of Health and Social Development, Deakin Health Economics, Deakin University, Locked Bag 20001, Geelong, VIC, 3220, Australia. cathy.mihalopoulos@deakin.edu.au.', 'School of Health and Social Development, Deakin Health Economics, Deakin University, Locked Bag 20001, Geelong, VIC, 3220, Australia.', 'School of Health and Social Development, Deakin Health Economics, Deakin University, Locked Bag 20001, Geelong, VIC, 3220, Australia.', 'School of Health and Social Development, Deakin Health Economics, Deakin University, Locked Bag 20001, Geelong, VIC, 3220, Australia.', 'School of Public Health, The University of Queensland, Herston, QLD, 4006, Australia.', 'Policy and Epidemiology Group, Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research, Wacol, QLD, 4076, Australia.', 'School of Health and Social Development, Deakin Health Economics, Deakin University, Locked Bag 20001, Geelong, VIC, 3220, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180409,Netherlands,Qual Life Res,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",9210257,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Australia', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of Life/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['AQoL-4D', 'Affective disorder', 'Anxiety', 'Mental health', 'Substance use disorder', 'Utilities']",2018/04/11 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2018/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11136-018-1843-2 [pii]', '10.1007/s11136-018-1843-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Qual Life Res. 2018 Jul;27(7):1815-1825. doi: 10.1007/s11136-018-1843-2.

This minority has received little empirical study, leaving the prevalence and predictors of enduring mental health unknown. We turn to the population-representative Dunedin cohort, followed from birth to midlife, to compare people never-diagnosed with mental disorder (N = 171; 17% prevalence) to those diagnosed at 1-2 study waves, the cohort mode (N = 409). Surprisingly, compared to this modal group, never-diagnosed Study members were not born into unusually well-to-do families, nor did their enduring mental health follow markedly sound physical health, or unusually high intelligence. Instead, they tended to have an advantageous temperament/personality style, and negligible family history of mental disorder. As adults, they report superior educational and occupational attainment, greater life satisfaction, and higher-quality relationships.

These resonate with earlier concepts from cybernetics and sociology. These approaches could be applied to understanding some of the dynamics leading to the patterning of mental health problems in populations.

Despite the prevalence and gravity of mental disorders, our knowledge concerning everyday challenges associated with them is relatively limited. One of the most studied deficits related to everyday challenges is language impairment, yet we do not know how mental disorders can impact common forms of written communication, for example, social media. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to investigate written communication challenges manifest in online mental health communities focusing on depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, as well as the impact of participating in these online mental health communities on written communication. As the control, we selected three online health communities focusing on positive emotion, exercising, and weight management. METHODS: We examined lexical diversity and readability, both important features for measuring the quality of writing. We used four well-established readability metrics that consider word frequencies and syntactic complexity to measure writers' written communication ability. We then measured the lexical diversity by calculating the percentage of unique words in posts. To compare lexical diversity and readability among communities, we first applied pairwise independent sample t tests, followed by P value adjustments using the prespecified Hommel procedure to adjust for multiple comparison. To measure the changes, we applied linear least squares regression to the readability and lexical diversity scores against the interaction sequence for each member, followed by pairwise independent sample t tests and P value adjustments. Given the large sample of members, we also report effect sizes and 95% CIs for the pairwise comparisons. RESULTS: On average, members of depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia communities showed indications of difficulty expressing their ideas compared with three other online health communities. Our results also suggest that participating in these platforms has the potential to improve members' written communication. For example, members of all three mental health communities showed statistically significant improvement in both lexical diversity and readability compared with members of the OHC focusing on positive emotion. CONCLUSIONS: We provide new insights into the written communication challenges faced by individuals suffering from depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. A comparison with three other online health communities suggests that written communication in mental health communities is significantly more difficult to read, while also consisting of a significantly less diverse lexicon. We contribute practical suggestions for utilizing our findings in Web-based communication settings to enhance members' communicative experience. We consider these findings to be an important step toward understanding and addressing everyday written communication challenges among individuals suffering from mental disorders.","['Park, Albert', 'Conway, Mike']","['Park A', 'Conway M']","['Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.']",['eng'],"['K99 LM011393/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 LM011393/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'T15 LM007124/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180410,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,IM,"['Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*trends', 'Social Media/*instrumentation', 'Text Messaging/*instrumentation']",PMC5915669,,['NOTNLM'],"['bipolar', 'bipolar and related disorders', 'bipolar disorder', 'communications media', 'community networks', 'consumer health information', 'depression', 'depressive disorder', 'depressive disorder, major', 'informatics', 'information science', 'mental health', 'psychosocial support system', 'schizophrenia', 'schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders', 'schizotypal personality disorder', 'self-help groups', 'social support']",2018/04/11 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/04/12 06:00'],"['2017/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['v20i4e121 [pii]', '10.2196/jmir.8219 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2018 Apr 10;20(4):e121. doi: 10.2196/jmir.8219.,4,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2419-0131', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3209-8108']",,['Conflicts of Interest: None declared.'],"['(c)Albert Park, Mike Conway.

However, athletes have a unique set of risk factors that can affect the likelihood of developing depression. Screening tools have been developed specifically for athletes such as the Sport Mental Health Assessment Tool (SMHAT). The management of the depressed athlete should involve an individualized approach, with methods such as counseling, interpersonal therapy, or cognitive behavioral therapy being used. Some may require antidepressant medication. Depressive disorders are also linked to sucidality in athletes, and the team physician and sporting organisation should have a crisis management plan in place for mental health emergencies.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of prior mental health disorders in parents by birth 2013 and by parent and child characteristics, including Aboriginality, maternal age, socioeconomic status and diagnostic groups. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2005, there was an increase in prevalence of prior mental health disorders in mothers, from 76 per 1000 births in 1990 to 131 per 1000 births in 2005 (3.7% increase per 2013 in the odds of children being born to mothers with a prior mental health disorder). There was also a 4.7% increase in odds per 2013 in the prevalence of mental health contacts that had taken place in the 12 months before the birth 2013 in mothers.

These psychosocial manifestations may lead to MH emergencies and hospitalization. However, the prevalence and predictors of MH hospitalization associated with hirsutism are not well-understood. The objective of this study was to determine the likelihood and associations of MH hospitalization among females in the US with hirsutism. Data were analyzed from female inpatients in the 2005-2014 National Inpatient Sample, a representative sample of US hospitalizations. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to examine the association of MH hospitalization and comorbidities with hirsutism diagnosis. Patients with hirsutism were more likely to also have a comorbid MH disorder, compared to those without hirsutism (49.5% vs 27.5%, odds ratio [95% CI]: 3.33 [3.14-3.54]), including higher odds of having 14 of the 15 MH disorders studied. Moreover, those with hirsutism had higher odds of hospitalization for a MH disorder in multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for sex, age, and insurance coverage (14.0% vs 3.6%, 3.84 [3.50-4.21]). The mean length of hospital stay (LOS) for a MH disorder was greater among inpatients with vs without hirsutism (12.8 vs 7.1 days, beta [95% CI]: 5.71 [4.24-7.18]). There were two-way interactions of hirsutism and MH hospitalization as predictors of longer LOS. Among female inpatients with hirsutism, MH hospitalization was associated with younger age, having health insurance, and longer LOS, and inversely associated with elective admission. In conclusion, female inpatients with hirsutism have higher odds of comorbid MH disorders and MH hospitalizations, with much longer LOS. Patients may benefit from increased access to outpatient follow-up, as poor disease control may contribute to worse MH outcomes and more frequent hospitalization.","['Kim, Anne B', 'Cheng, Brian T', 'Hassan, Shahzeb']","['Kim AB', 'Cheng BT', 'Hassan S']","['Rush University Medical College, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 303 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.

Foucault's account of the modern development links together 'madness', psychiatry and the asylum. We pick up the story at the point Foucault left it, the mid-twentieth century, to examine cultural and social processes that are reshaping concepts, discourse and practices - the 'social imaginary' - around mental health, with particular reference to the apparent rise in mental health problems among the young. We conclude that this apparent rise may reflect cultural and social changes in representations of mental health. In addition, over recent decades there have been increasingly evident fractures in social solidarity, interacting with and exacerbating specific socio-political-economic-environmental stressors on younger generations, including increasing intergenerational wealth inequalities and accelerating environmental concerns.","['Bolton, Derek', 'Bhugra, Dinesh']","['Bolton D', 'Bhugra D']","[""Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."", ""Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200429,England,Int Rev Psychiatry,"International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)",8918131,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Humans', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology', '*Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', '*Psychiatry']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anomie', 'Durkheim', 'Foucault', 'Mental health', 'intergenerational wealth inequalities', 'post-truth', 'social imaginary', 'young people']",2020/04/30 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2020/04/30 06:00'],"['2020/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09540261.2020.1753968 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Rev Psychiatry. 2021 Feb-Mar;33(1-2):154-161. doi: 10.1080/09540261.2020.1753968.

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of several databases (Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) and a manual search to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of early rehabilitation versus no early rehabilitation or standard care for the prevention of PICS. The primary outcomes were short-term physical-related, cognitive-related and mental health-related outcomes assessed during hospitalisation. The secondary outcomes were the standardised, long-term health-related quality of life scores (EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ5D) and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey Physical Function Scale (SF-36 PF)). We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to rate the quality of evidence (QoE). RESULTS: Six RCTs selected from 5105 screened abstracts were included. Early rehabilitation significantly improved short-term physical-related outcomes, as indicated by an increased Medical Research Council scale score (standardised mean difference (SMD): 0.38, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.66, p=0.009) (QoE: low) and a decreased incidence of intensive care unit-acquired weakness (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.82, p=0.01, QoE: low), compared with standard care or no early rehabilitation. However, the two groups did not differ in terms of cognitive-related delirium-free days (SMD: -0.02, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.20, QoE: low) and the mental health-related Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score (OR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.12, QoE: low). Early rehabilitation did not improve the long-term outcomes of PICS as characterised by EQ5D and SF-36 PF. CONCLUSIONS: Early rehabilitation improved only short-term physical-related outcomes in patients with critical illness. Additional large RCTs are needed.","['Fuke, Ryota', 'Hifumi, Toru', 'Kondo, Yutaka', 'Hatakeyama, Junji', 'Takei, Tetsuhiro', 'Yamakawa, Kazuma', 'Inoue, Shigeaki', 'Nishida, Osamu']","['Fuke R', 'Hifumi T', 'Kondo Y', 'Hatakeyama J', 'Takei T', 'Yamakawa K', 'Inoue S', 'Nishida O']","['Division of Infectious Diseases and Infection Control, Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Emergency Medical Center, Kagawa University Hospital, Kita-gun, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nakagami-gun, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Yokohama City Minato Red Cross Hospital, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Trauma and Surgical Critical Care, Osaka General Medical Center, Osaka City, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Tokai University Hachioji Hospital, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Anaesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20180505,England,BMJ Open,BMJ open,101552874,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cognition', '*Critical Care', 'Critical Illness/*rehabilitation', 'Delirium', '*Health Status', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', '*Intensive Care Units', 'Mental Health', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Quality of Life', 'Survivors', 'Syndrome']",PMC5942437,,['NOTNLM'],"['early rehabilitation', 'intensive care unit', 'post-intensive care syndrome', 'sepsis']",2018/05/08 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2018/05/07 06:00'],"['2018/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['bmjopen-2017-019998 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019998 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Open. 2018 May 5;8(5):e019998. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019998.,5,,,['Competing interests: None declared.'],"['(c) Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of', 'the article) 2018.

Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area (SPMA) provides a forewarning of the burden of mental disorders in urban settings in developing world. The aim of this study is to estimate prevalence, severity, and treatment of recently active DSM-IV mental disorders. We examined socio-demographic correlates, aspects of urban living such as internal migration, exposure to violence, and neighborhood-level social deprivation with 12-month mental disorders. METHODS AND RESULTS: A representative cross-sectional household sample of 5,037 adults was interviewed face-to-face using the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), to generate diagnoses of DSM-IV mental disorders within 12 months of interview, disorder severity, and treatment. Administrative data on neighborhood social deprivation were gathered. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate individual and contextual correlates of disorders, severity, and treatment. Around thirty percent of respondents reported a 12-month disorder, with an even distribution across severity levels. Anxiety disorders were the most common disorders (affecting 19.9%), followed by mood (11%), impulse-control (4.3%), and substance use (3.6%) disorders. Exposure to crime was associated with all four types of disorder. Migrants had low prevalence of all four types compared to stable residents. High urbanicity was associated with impulse-control disorders and high social deprivation with substance use disorders. Vulnerable subgroups were observed: women and migrant men living in most deprived areas. Only one-third of serious cases had received treatment in the previous year. DISCUSSION: Adults living in Sao Paulo megacity had prevalence of mental disorders at greater levels than similar surveys conducted in other areas of the world. Integration of mental health promotion and care into the rapidly expanding Brazilian primary health system should be strengthened. This strategy might become a model for poorly resourced and highly populated developing countries.","['Andrade, Laura Helena', 'Wang, Yuan-Pang', 'Andreoni, Solange', 'Silveira, Camila Magalhaes', 'Alexandrino-Silva, Clovis', 'Siu, Erica Rosanna', 'Nishimura, Raphael', 'Anthony, James C', 'Gattaz, Wagner Farid', 'Kessler, Ronald C', 'Viana, Maria Carmen']","['Andrade LH', 'Wang YP', 'Andreoni S', 'Silveira CM', 'Alexandrino-Silva C', 'Siu ER', 'Nishimura R', 'Anthony JC', 'Gattaz WF', 'Kessler RC', 'Viana MC']","['Section of Psychiatric Epidemiology-LIM 23, Department and Institute of Psychiatry, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil. lhsgandr@usp.br']",['eng'],"['R01 DA016558/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 TW006481/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-MH069864/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R13-MH066849/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH070884/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R13 MH066849/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH069864/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01MH070884/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'K05 DA015799/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R03-TW006481/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120214,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Brazil/epidemiology', '*Cities', 'Developing Countries', '*Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence']",PMC3279422,,,,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/08/01 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-11-19831 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0031879 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31879. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0031879.

DATA SOURCES: Weighted data collected between 2001 and 2004 from NCS-A participants (age: 13-18 years; N = 2939) meeting DSM-IV criteria for any lifetime mental disorder, assessed with WHO CIDI, and from their biological mothers. STUDY DESIGN: National representative cohort. DATA COLLECTION: Maternal psychopathology was assessed with self-report, adolescent mental health service use with the Service Assessment for Children and Adolescents. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Maternal psychopathology predicted offspring mental health service use across various service sectors, except for school services. In the mental health specialty sector, estimates were highest for maternal affective (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.17, 95 percent confidence interval (CI) = 1.66-2.82) and any mental disorder (HR = 2.13, 95 percent CI = 1.53-2.97). For offspring use of any mental health services, estimates were highest for maternal behavior (HR = 1.60, 95 percent CI = 1.15-2.21) and substance use disorders (HR = 1.57, 95 percent CI = 1.09-2.24). Treatment delay of offspring mental health service use was predicted by maternal behavior disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal psychopathology fostered mental health service use in offspring with mental disorders, while maternal behavior disorders might also retard treatment. Considering parental psychopathology may help improving the prevention of unmet offspring service needs.","['Stalujanis, Esther', 'Meinlschmidt, Gunther', 'Belardi, Angelo', 'Tegethoff, Marion']","['Stalujanis E', 'Meinlschmidt G', 'Belardi A', 'Tegethoff M']","['Division of Clinical Psychology and Psychiatry, Department of Psychology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Clinical Psychology and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, International Psychoanalytic University, Berlin, Germany.', 'Division of Clinical Psychology and Epidemiology, Department of Psychology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Clinical Psychology and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, International Psychoanalytic University, Berlin, Germany.', 'Division of Clinical Psychology and Epidemiology, Department of Psychology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Clinical Psychology and Psychiatry, Department of Psychology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Clinical Psychology and Psychiatry, Department of Psychology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['2013S1A2A2035364/Korea Research Foundation/International', 'PC_28/17/Stanley Thomas Johnson Stiftung &amp; Gottfried und Julia', 'Bangerter-Rhyner-Stiftung/International', 'PZ00P1_137023/SNSF_/Swiss National Science Foundation/Switzerland', 'Research fund of the International Psychoanalytic University/International', '100014_135328/SNSF_/Swiss National Science Foundation/Switzerland', 'KLS-4304-08-2017/Swiss Cancer League (Krebsliga Schweiz)/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181128,United States,Health Serv Res,Health services research,0053006,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Mother-Child Relations', 'Mothers/*psychology', 'Object Attachment', '*Psychology, Adolescent']",PMC6338299,,['NOTNLM'],"['adolescent', 'epidemiology', 'maternal psychopathology', 'mental health service use', 'treatment delay']",2018/11/30 06:00,2020/01/24 06:00,['2018/11/30 06:00'],"['2018/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['HESR13097 [pii]', '10.1111/1475-6773.13097 [doi]']",ppublish,Health Serv Res. 2019 Feb;54(1):149-157. doi: 10.1111/1475-6773.13097.

The model for Mental Health and Development (MHD) offers community-based care for people with mental disorders in 11 low- and middle-income countries. METHOD: In Kenya, using a pre-post design, 117 consecutively enrolled participants with schizophrenia-spectrum and bipolar disorders were followed-up at 10 and 20 months. Comparison outcomes were drawn from the literature. Costs were analysed from societal and health system perspectives. RESULTS: From the societal perspective, MHD cost Int$ 594 per person in the first year and Int$ 876 over 2 years. The cost per healthy day gained was Int$ 7.96 in the first year and Int$ 1.03 over 2 years - less than the agricultural minimum wage. The cost per disability-adjusted life year averted over 2 years was Int$ 13.1 and Int$ 727 from the societal and health system perspectives, respectively, on par with antiretrovirals for HIV. CONCLUSIONS: MHD achieved increasing returns over time. The model appears cost-effective and equitable, especially over 2 years. Its affordability relies on multi-sectoral participation nationally and internationally.","['de Menil, V', 'Knapp, M', 'McDaid, D', 'Raja, S', 'Kingori, J', 'Waruguru, M', 'Wood, S K', 'Mannarath, S', 'Lund, C']","['de Menil V', 'Knapp M', 'McDaid D', 'Raja S', 'Kingori J', 'Waruguru M', 'Wood SK', 'Mannarath S', 'Lund C']","['Department of Social Policy,London School of Economics and Political Science,UK.', 'Personal Social Services Research Unit,London School of Economics and Political Science,UK.', 'Personal Social Services Research Unit,London School of Economics and Political Science,UK.', 'Policy and Practice Directorate,BasicNeeds,India.', 'BasicNeeds Kenya.', 'BasicNeeds Kenya.', 'Policy and Practice Directorate,BasicNeeds,India.', 'Policy and Practice Directorate,BasicNeeds,India.', 'Alan J.

This article provides an outline of the various elements involved in a mental state assessment, so that clinicians such as non-mental health nurses can identify people experiencing deteriorating mental health.","['Rees, Helen']",['Rees H'],"['Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, England.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210412,England,Nurs Stand,Nursing standard (Royal College of Nursing (Great Britain) : 1987),9012906,,"['Anxiety', '*Anxiety Disorders', 'Humans', '*Mental Health']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['assessment', 'delusion', 'depression', 'mental health', 'obsessive compulsive disorder', 'post-traumatic stress disorder', 'postnatal depression']",2021/04/13 06:00,2022/01/01 06:00,['2021/04/12 06:42'],"['2020/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/12 06:42 [entrez]']","['e11612 [pii]', '10.7748/ns.2021.e11612 [doi]']",ppublish,Nurs Stand. 2021 Jun 2;36(6):62-69. doi: 10.7748/ns.2021.e11612.

Primary care is the first point of treatment for most mental health disorders. Since the urban environment and health are intrinsically linked, it is useful to examine the effectiveness of Nature-Based Solutions in addressing mental health. AIMS: The aim of this scoping review was to examine ""How urban green spaces can improve mental health and wellbeing among patients attending general practice and primary care?"" METHODS: The scoping review framework comprised a five-stage process developed by Arksey and O'Malley. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were included in the review, mostly cross-sectional studies. A wide range of mental health outcomes were identified. Out of the 25 included studies, 23 showed positive associations between mental health and green space characteristics. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that while green spaces are associated with positive mental health outcomes, most studies were cross-sectional in nature and provided limited evidence for association. Furthermore, the population samples used in most of the studies were taken from national survey data and were not specifically primary care patients. Further studies that assess primary care patients specifically are warranted.","['Callaghan, A', 'McCombe, G', 'Harrold, A', 'McMeel, C', 'Mills, G', 'Moore-Cherry, N', 'Cullen, W']","['Callaghan A', 'McCombe G', 'Harrold A', 'McMeel C', 'Mills G', 'Moore-Cherry N', 'Cullen W']","['School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', 'School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', 'School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', 'School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', 'School of Geography, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', 'School of Geography, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', 'School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200420,England,J Ment Health,"Journal of mental health (Abingdon, England)",9212352,IM,"['Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', '*Parks, Recreational', 'Primary Health Care', '*Urban Population']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Urban environment', 'green spaces', 'mental health']",2020/04/21 06:00,2021/10/30 06:00,['2020/04/21 06:00'],"['2020/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09638237.2020.1755027 [doi]'],ppublish,J Ment Health. 2021 Apr;30(2):179-193. doi: 10.1080/09638237.2020.1755027.

PARTICIPANTS: Undergraduate students (N = 196,872) who completed the American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment (Fall 2008-Fall 2012 administrations). METHODS: Written cross-sectional survey. RESULTS: Sexual minority student-athletes had a higher risk of experiencing mental health difficulties than their heterosexual athlete peers. There were no significant differences in mental health between sexual minority male athletes and nonathletes. Sexual minority female athletes appeared to fare better than nonathlete peers. Substance use was greater among sexual minority students (athlete and nonathlete) and was mediated by mental health.

To assess the breadth of mental and substance coverage in the Cochrane review system. Methods. All mental health and substance entries were identified from the 2005 to April 2012 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Results. A total of 1019 entries focused on mental health or substance misuse, with 698 (68.5%) being completed reviews. One out of every five entries focused on serious mental illness/psychosis. Systematic reviews addressing unipolar depression, dementia and certain substance disorders also appeared well-represented. In contrast, a number of impairing disorders frequently seen in practice received less attention, with bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and autism spectrum disorders each accounting for less than 2% of the entries. The majority of interventions reviewed involved medication (57.1%), although this was not the case for a number of childhood-onset disorders. Some diagnostic areas (sleep, anxiety, mood and substance) were addressed by multiple Cochrane review groups (CRGs). Conclusions. The Cochrane Collaboration is well poised to be a strong guiding influence to those seeking to employ evidence-based mental health care. Broadening its diagnostic coverage and diversifying types of intervention reviewed would probably further maximize its impact. A more centralized and directed approach of prioritizing topics could help ensure more comprehensive coverage.","['Green-Hennessy, S']",['Green-Hennessy S'],"['Department of Psychology, Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120829,England,Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences,101561091,IM,"['Anxiety Disorders', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders', '*Mental Health', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic']",PMC6998110,,,,2012/10/24 06:00,2016/04/24 06:00,['2012/10/24 06:00'],"['2012/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S2045796012000455 [pii]', '00045 [pii]', '10.1017/S2045796012000455 [doi]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci. 2013 Jun;22(2):155-62. doi: 10.1017/S2045796012000455.

35487232,NLM,MEDLINE,20220503,20220523,2468-2667 (Electronic),7,2022 May,Mental health of migrants with pre-migration exposure to armed conflict: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,e469-e481,S2468-2667(22)00061-5 [pii] 10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00061-5 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Exposure to armed conflict has been associated with negative mental health consequences. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder among migrants exposed to armed conflict. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched online databases (Cochrane Library, Embase, LILACS, PsycInfo [via Ovid], PubMed, and Web of Science Core Collection) for relevant observational studies published between Jan 1, 1994, and June 28, 2021. We included studies that used standardised psychiatric interviews to assess generalised anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder among migrants (refugees or internally displaced persons; aged >/=18 years) with pre-migration exposure to armed conflict. We excluded studies in which exposure to armed conflict could not be ascertained, studies that included a clinical population or people with chronic diseases that can trigger the onset of mental disease, and studies published before 1994. We used a random effects model to estimate each mental health disorder's pooled prevalence and random effects meta-regression to assess sources of heterogeneity. Two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias for each study using the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Prevalence Studies. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020209251. FINDINGS: Of the 13 935 studies identified, 34 met our inclusion criteria; these studies accounted for 15 549 migrants. We estimated a prevalence of current post-traumatic stress disorder of 31% (95% CI 23-40); prevalence of current major depressive disorder of 25% (17-34); and prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder of 14% (5-35). Younger age was associated with a higher prevalence of current post-traumatic stress disorder (odds ratio 0.95 [95% CI 0.90-0.99]), lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder (0.88 [0.83-0.92]), and current generalised anxiety disorder (0.87 [0.78-0.97]). A longer time since displacement was associated with a lower lifetime prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (0.88 [0.81-0.95]) and major depressive disorder (0.81 [0.77-0.86]). Migrating to a middle-income (8.09 [3.06-21.40]) or low-income (39.29 [11.96-129.70]) country was associated with increased prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder. INTERPRETATION: Migrants who are exposed to armed conflict are at high risk of mental health disorders. The mental health-care needs of migrants should be assessed soon after resettlement, and adequate care should be provided, with particular attention paid to young adults.

Some correctional facilities have developed mental health units (MHUs) to treat incarcerated individuals with SMI. OBJECTIVE: To identify existing MHUs in the United States and collate information on these units. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review using Criminal Justice Abstracts, ERIC, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SocINDEX, plus an exploratory review using the Google search engine were conducted. MHUs were included if they were located within an adult correctional facility in the United States, specifically catered to SMI populations, and were in active operation as of June 2019. RESULTS: Eleven articles were identified through the peer-reviewed literature, but there were still major gaps in the information on MHUs. The Google search identified 317 MHUs. The majority of units were located within prisons (79.5%) and served only men (76%). The Google search found information indicating that 169 (53.3%) offered groups or programming to inmates; 104 (32.8%) offered individual therapy; and 89 (23%) offered both. One hundred sixty-six units (52.4%) had dedicated mental health staff, and 75 (23.7%) provided mental health training to correctional officers. Information on funding and outcomes of the MHUs is presented. LIMITATIONS: Use of the Google search engine and sources that have not been peer reviewed limits the robustness of conclusions about the MHUs.

A multi-determined disorder such as major depressive disorder (MDD) does not fit a simple cause and effect model, but is similar to other complex occupational illnesses such as low back pain. Currently, a knowledge gap exists between mental health professionals and employers regarding symptom-based models of illness and function-based models of work performance. As a result, psychiatric disorders affecting workers are under-identified and under-treated and likely result in unmitigated impairment and disability. The authors examine several conceptual models for workplace mental illness across medical and psychological disciplines and propose a unifying construct. The utility of the existing screening methods for common workplace illnesses and their potential application are reviewed.

We focus on autism spectrum disorder, psychotic disorders, stress and anxiety disorders, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease and additionally discuss the comorbidity between inflammatory bowel disorder and mental health disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Human and animal studies show that sex may modify the relationship between the gut or immune system and brain and behavior. Sex also appears to modify the effect of microbial treatments such as probiotics and antibiotics on brain and behavior. There is emerging evidence that assessing the role of sex in the gut-brain axis may help elucidate the etiology of and identify effective treatments for neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders.","['Holingue, Calliope', 'Budavari, Alexa Curhan', 'Rodriguez, Katrina M', 'Zisman, Corina R', 'Windheim, Grace', 'Fallin, M Daniele']","['Holingue C', 'Budavari AC', 'Rodriguez KM', 'Zisman CR', 'Windheim G', 'Fallin MD']","['Department of Mental Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, 21205, USA. choling1@jhu.edu.', 'Department of Neuropsychology, Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore, MD, USA. choling1@jhu.edu.', ', Baltimore, USA. choling1@jhu.edu.', 'Department of Mental Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, 21205, USA.', 'Department of Mental Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, 21205, USA.', 'Section on the Neurobiology of Fear and Anxiety, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Public Health Studies, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, 21218, USA.', 'Department of Mental Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, 21205, USA.']",['eng'],['T32 MH014592/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20201120,United States,Curr Psychiatry Rep,Current psychiatry reports,100888960,IM,"['Animals', '*Autism Spectrum Disorder/epidemiology', 'Brain', 'Female', '*Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Sex Characteristics']",PMC7717677,['NIHMS1649610'],['NOTNLM'],"['Brain', 'Gut-brain axis', 'Mental health', 'Microbiome', 'Microbiota', 'Sex']",2020/11/21 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2020/11/20 12:15'],"['2020/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/20 12:15 [entrez]', '2020/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11920-020-01202-y [pii]', '10.1007/s11920-020-01202-y [doi]']",epublish,Curr Psychiatry Rep. 2020 Nov 20;22(12):83. doi: 10.1007/s11920-020-01202-y.,12,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8190-2385'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon retirement from the armed forces, many individuals go on to second careers as PSP. Individuals with prior military experience may be at even greater risk than nonveterans for developing mental health disorders. The present study was designed to examine the relationship between prior military service and symptoms of mental health disorders in PSP. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, observational study. Data for this study were collected from an anonymous, web-based, self-report survey of PSP in Canada. Invitations to participate were sent to PSP via their professional organizations. Indications of mental disorder(s) and symptom severity were assessed using well-validated self-report screening measures. RESULTS: Of the survey respondents who provided this information, 631 (6.8%) had prior armed forces experience; however, not all responses were complete. Ex-military PSP reported significantly more exposure to traumatic events and were approximately 1.5 times more likely to screen positive for indications of PTSD, mood, anxiety, or acute stress disorders and to have contemplated suicide than those without prior armed forces experience. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, individuals in PSP with prior service experience in the armed forces were more likely to screen positive for indicators of some mental health disorders. Accordingly, mental health practitioners should inquire about previous service in the armed forces when screening, assessing, and treating PSP.","['Groll, Dianne L', 'Ricciardelli, Rosemary', 'Carleton, R Nicholas', 'Anderson, Greg', 'Cramm, Heidi']","['Groll DL', 'Ricciardelli R', 'Carleton RN', 'Anderson G', 'Cramm H']","[""Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."", ""Memorial University of Newfoundland, Saint John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada."", 'University of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.', 'Justice Institute of British Columbia, New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada.', ""Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['FRN 285489/CIHR/Canada', 'FRN 162545/CIHR/Canada']","['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191213,United States,Can J Psychiatry,Canadian journal of psychiatry.

Even though most patients adapt successfully, a significant number of individuals show adaptation problems and develop additional mental health problems. OBJECTIVE: For this reason, this article focuses on the importance of psychosocial adaptation as a core process in the context of quality of life. RESULTS: Important findings pointing at the association between multimorbidity and mental health are summarized, and the stress-response perspective on psychosocial adjustment is introduced. Furthermore, cognitive-affective processing of the disease (in the context of illness perceptions) and interpersonal emotion regulation are presented as relevant examples for processes involved in psychological adaptation to multimorbidity. As an intervention possibility, expressive writing is given as a feasible example. CONCLUSION: Viewing adjustment problems to multimorbidity from a stress-response perspective offers a framework for a deeper understanding of core processes regarding multimorbidity and quality of life that is not only important for research but also for clinical practice. This article ends with a general summary and an outlook on clinical implications of the introduced stress-response concept of adjustment to multimorbidity.","['Schulze, Thekla', 'Maercker, Andreas', 'Horn, Andrea B']","['Schulze T', 'Maercker A', 'Horn AB']","['Department of Psychopathology and Clinical Intervention, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140228,Switzerland,Gerontology,Gerontology,7601655,IM,"['Adjustment Disorders/diagnosis/psychology', 'Aged', 'Aging/*psychology', '*Comorbidity', 'Humans', '*Mental Health', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', '*Social Adjustment', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Syndrome']",,,,,2014/03/08 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2014/03/08 06:00'],"['2013/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['000358559 [pii]', '10.1159/000358559 [doi]']",ppublish,Gerontology. 2014;60(3):249-54. doi: 10.1159/000358559.

Social inequalities are likely to widen during such periods and disproportionately affect people with mental disorders. The present study aims to compare self-reported changes in indicators of socioeconomic position during the economic recession in Portugal among people with and without mental disorders in the beginning of this period. Three dimensions were assessed, namely employment situation, experiences of financial hardship and subjective social status. METHODS: Data from the World Mental Health Survey Initiative Portugal (2008/2009) and from the National Mental Health Survey Follow-up (2015/2016) were used (n = 911). Multinomial and logistic recession models were performed to examine the association between the presence of any 12-month mood or anxiety mental disorder in 2008/2009 and indicators of socioeconomic position in 2015/2016. All analyses were adjusted for gender, age, presence of any physical disorder and education at the baseline. RESULTS: Participants that had any mental disorder in the beginning of the economic recession reported 2.20 (95% CI 1.31-3.71; P < 0.01) higher odds of financial hardship related to daily life in 2015/2016, when compared with those without any mental disorder, after adjusting for age, gender, education and presence of any physical disorder. The results may also suggest a pattern of increased socioeconomic disadvantage among people with prior mental disorder, despite not reaching statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the economic recession may have contributed to wider social inequalities between people with and without mental disorders. Policies to support these individuals, such as access to treatment and alleviation of financial hardship, should be a priority in times of economic downturn.","['Antunes, A', 'Frasquilho, D', 'Azeredo-Lopes, S', 'Silva, M', 'Cardoso, G', 'Caldas-de-Almeida, J M']","['Antunes A', 'Frasquilho D', 'Azeredo-Lopes S', 'Silva M', 'Cardoso G', 'Caldas-de-Almeida JM']","['Chronic Diseases Research Center (CEDOC), Nova Medical School, Nova University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Chronic Diseases Research Center (CEDOC), Nova Medical School, Nova University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Chronic Diseases Research Center (CEDOC), Nova Medical School, Nova University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Chronic Diseases Research Center (CEDOC), Nova Medical School, Nova University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Chronic Diseases Research Center (CEDOC), Nova Medical School, Nova University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Chronic Diseases Research Center (CEDOC), Nova Medical School, Nova University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20180806,England,Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences,101561091,IM,"['Adult', 'Economic Recession/*statistics & numerical data', 'Employment/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*economics/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Portugal/epidemiology', 'Quality of Life/psychology', '*Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC6998866,,['NOTNLM'],"['Common mental disorders', 'epidemiology', 'mental health', 'population survey', 'social factors']",2018/08/07 06:00,2019/11/15 06:00,['2018/08/07 06:00'],"['2018/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['S2045796018000392 [pii]', '00039 [pii]', '10.1017/S2045796018000392 [doi]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci. 2019 Dec;28(6):638-643. doi: 10.1017/S2045796018000392.

This has led to increased demand for healthcare services, but mental health outcomes may also be particularly sensitive to the availability of social services. This paper examines the variation in the absolute and relative amounts that high-income countries spend on healthcare and social services to determine whether increased expenditure on social services relative to healthcare expenditure might be associated with better mental health outcomes. METHODS: This paper estimates the association between patterns of government spending and population mental health, as measured by the death rate resulting from mental and behavioural disorders, across member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We use country-level repeated measures multivariable modelling for the period from 1995 to 2016 with region and time effects, adjusted for total spending and demographic and economic characteristics. Healthcare spending includes all curative services, long-term care, ancillary services, medical goods, preventative care and administration whilst social spending consists of all transfer payments made to individuals and families as part of the welfare state. RESULTS: We find that a higher ratio of social to healthcare expenditure is associated with significantly better mental health outcomes for OECD populations, as measured by the death rate resulting from mental and behavioural disorders. We also find that there is no statistically significant association between healthcare spending and population mental health when we do not control for social spending. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that OECD countries can have a significant impact on population mental health by investing a greater proportion of total expenditure in social services.","['Park, Daniel S', 'Han, Jing', 'Torabi, Mahmoud', 'Forget, Evelyn L']","['Park DS', 'Han J', 'Torabi M', 'Forget EL']","['Somerville College, University of Oxford, Woodstock Road, Oxford, OX26HD, UK.', 'Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, 727 McDermot Avenue, Winnipeg, MB, R3E 3P5, Canada.', 'Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, 727 McDermot Avenue, Winnipeg, MB, R3E 3P5, Canada.', 'Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, 727 McDermot Avenue, Winnipeg, MB, R3E 3P5, Canada.

We aimed to investigate whether suicidal ideation might be influenced by physical and mental ill-health multimorbidity. METHODS: Data from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey of England were analysed. Participants who responded to the suicidal thoughts question were grouped into four distinct categories based on their health conditions (Common mental disorders (CMD) only, physical health conditions only, CMD/physical health multimorbidity and a control group with neither physical nor mental health conditions). Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted and odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs are presented. RESULTS: In the fully adjusted model, both the multimorbidity and CMD-only groups were associated with higher levels of suicidal ideation relative to the control group. LIMITATIONS: Secondary analyses of cross-sectional data. CONCLUSIONS: Although multimorbidity was associated with suicidal thoughts, it does not appear to elevate risk beyond the independent effects of common mental disorders or physical health problems. Primary care and mental health clinicians should consider assessment of suicidal ideation among patients with multimorbid physical/mental health conditions.","['Kavalidou, Katerina', 'Smith, Daniel J', ""O'Connor, Rory C""]","['Kavalidou K', 'Smith DJ', ""O'Connor RC""]","['Suicidal Behaviour Research Laboratory, Institute of Health & Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary, and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom.

METHODS: A dataset containing registration data for all patients receiving public mental health service was constructed and subsequently matched, on age and sex, in a final patient to comparison patient ratio of 1:8, with health care users who did not receive treatment in the mental health system. Three groups emerged: a patient PD group-patients with psychiatric disorders treated in public mental health care (n = 76 677); a comparison patient PD group-comparison patients with PDs treated in physicians only (n = 277 627); and a patient- comparison patient non-PD group-patients (treated in specialized publicly funded care or by their physician) without PDs (n = 329 177). Examining over 42 million billing records for all of these patients, we compared the average number of visits and the average health only (nonpsychiatric) billing cost per each patient during the 9-year study period across the groups. RESULTS: Among all health care users in the data, the health costs (Total Costs - Mental Health Costs) were greater on average for the patients with PD group ($3437) and the comparison patient PD group ($3265), compared with patient-comparison patient non-PD group ($1345). Forty-six percent of the comparison sample had a PD. CONCLUSIONS: Having a mental health problem is related to greater health-related expenditures. This has important policy implications on how mental health resources are constructed and rationed within the health care system.","['Cawthorpe, David', 'Wilkes, Thomas C R', 'Guyn, Lindsay', 'Li, Bing', 'Lu, Mingshan']","['Cawthorpe D', 'Wilkes TC', 'Guyn L', 'Li B', 'Lu M']","['Child and Adolescent Mental Health and Addictions Program, Alberta Health Services, Calgary Zone, Calgary, Alberta. cawthord@ucalgary.ca']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Can J Psychiatry,Canadian journal of psychiatry.

Methods A systematic search of the literature was conducted in PubMed, EBSCO (including Academic Search Complete, ERIC, Academic Source, MasterFILE Premier, MedicLatina, MEDLINE, and the Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection), Science Direct, Psicodoc, Springer Link, Taylor & Francis, Wiley Online Library, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Redalyc, SciELO, Ovid, Embase, and ProQuest (including Health and Medical Complete, the Nursing and Allied Health Source, Psychology Journals, and Social Science Journals). The search criterion was the descriptor ""positive mental health."" Results Of 51 studies consulted, 84% used a quantitative approach; 84% were published in English; and the same percentage were conducted between 2000 and 2014. The concept of positive mental health has been applied in essentially five different ways: as the absence of disease; as the subject of the Jahoda model; as a combination of factors on the Lluch scale; as a synonym of well-being; and as part of more complex scales of measurement. Conclusions Positive mental health should not be viewed as the opposite of a mental disorder, the absence of disease, or the sum of a given set of personal conditions. It is important to move forward in the development of conceptual models that will serve as a basis for approaching mental health from the perspective of health promotion.","['Munoz, Cristobal Ovidio', 'Restrepo, Diego', 'Cardona, Doris']","['Munoz CO', 'Restrepo D', 'Cardona D']",,['spa'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Rev Panam Salud Publica,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,9705400,IM,"['Health Promotion', 'Humans', '*Mental Health/trends', '*Models, Psychological', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Self Concept', 'Self Efficacy']",,,,,2016/10/19 06:00,2018/01/09 06:00,['2016/10/19 06:00'],"['2015/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['S1020-49892016000300166 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Panam Salud Publica. 2016 Mar;39(3):166-173.,3,,,,,Construccion del concepto de salud mental positiva: revision sistematica.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A central theme emerges from these contributions: if we are to make genuine progress in explaining, predicting, and treating mental illness, we must study the systems from which psychopathology emerges. As the articles in this collection make clear, the systems that give rise to psychopathology encompass a host of components across biological, psychological, and social levels of analysis, intertwined in a web of complex interactions. The task of advancing our understanding of these systems will be a challenging one. Yet, this challenge presents a unique opportunity. From physics to ecology, there is a rapidly evolving body of interdisciplinary research dedicated to investigating complex systems. This work provides clear guidance for psychiatric research, opportunities for collaboration, and a set of tools and concepts from which we can draw in our efforts to understand mental health, helping us move toward our ultimate aim of improving the prevention and treatment of psychopathology.","['Fried, Eiko I', 'Robinaugh, Donald J']","['Fried EI', 'Robinaugh DJ']","['Department of Clinical Psychology, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands. eikofried@gmail.com.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School & Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['1K23MH113805 - 01A1/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],"['Editorial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200714,England,BMC Med,BMC medicine,101190723,IM,"['Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*therapy', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Psychopathology/*methods', 'Research Design']",PMC7359484,,,,2020/07/15 06:00,2021/02/04 06:00,['2020/07/15 06:00'],"['2020/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12916-020-01668-w [pii]', '1668 [pii]', '10.1186/s12916-020-01668-w [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med. 2020 Jul 14;18(1):205. doi: 10.1186/s12916-020-01668-w.,1,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: To summarise evidence about parental mental disorder and child physical health. METHOD: We searched seven databases for cohort or case-control studies quantifying associations between parental mental disorders (substance use, psychotic, mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, post-traumatic stress and eating) and offspring physical health. Studies were excluded if: they reported perinatal outcomes only (<28 days) or outcomes after age 18; they measured outcome prior to exposure; or the sample was drawn from diseased children. A meta-analysis was conducted. The protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42017072620). RESULTS: Searches revealed 15 945 non-duplicated studies. Forty-one studies met our inclusion criteria: ten investigated accidents/injuries; eight asthma; three other atopic diseases; ten overweight/obesity; ten studied other illnesses (eight from low-and middle-income countries (LMICs)). Half of the studies investigated maternal perinatal mental health, 17% investigated paternal mental disorder and 87% examined maternal depression. Meta-analysis revealed significantly higher rates of injuries (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.26), asthma (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.12-1.41) and outcomes recorded in LMICs (malnutrition: OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.74-3.73; diarrhoea: OR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.65-2.84). Evidence was inconclusive for obesity and other atopic disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Children of parents with mental disorder have health disadvantages; however, the evidence base is limited to risks for offspring following postnatal depression in mothers and there is little focus on fathers in the literature. Understanding the physical health risks of these vulnerable children is vital to improving lives. Future work should focus on discovering mechanisms linking physical and mental health across generations.

On average, national adherence varied widely by state, and performance did not substantially improve during the past 5 years. Mean national adherence rates for the two measures related to timeliness of care were below 50%. For each measure, scientific evidence to support the association between adherence and improved clinical outcomes was scarce.

Concerning the mental health care sector, little data exist about the Internet use of psychiatric patients. It is the scope of this current study to analyze the quantity and pattern of Internet usage among mental health patients. METHODS: Patients from all services of the Department of Psychiatry at a university hospital were surveyed by completing a 29-item questionnaire. The data analysis included evaluation of frequencies, as well as group comparisons. RESULTS: 337 patients participated in the survey, of whom 79.5% were Internet users. Social media was utilized by less than half of the users: social networks (47.8%), forums (19.4%), chats (18.7%), blogs (12.3%). 70.9% used the Internet for mental health related reasons. The contents accessed by the patients included: information on mental disorders (57.8%), information on medication (43.7%), search for mental health services (38.8%), platforms with other patients (19.8%) and platforms with mental health professionals (17.2%). Differences in the pattern of use between users with low, medium and high frequency of Internet use were statistically significant for all entities of social media (p < 0.01), search for mental health services (p = 0.017) and usage of platforms with mental health professionals (p = 0. 048). The analysis of differences in Internet use depending on the participants' type of mental disorder revealed no statistically significant differences, with one exception. Regarding the Internet's role in mental health care, the participants showed differing opinions: 36.2% believe that the Internet has or may have helped them in coping with their mental disorder, while 38.4% stated the contrary. CONCLUSIONS: Most psychiatric patients are Internet users. Mental health related Internet use is common among patients, mainly for information seeking. The use of social media is generally less frequent. It varies significantly between different user types and was shown to be associated with high frequency of Internet use. The results illustrate the importance of the Internet in mental health related contexts and may contribute to the further development of mental health related online offers.","['Kalckreuth, Sophie', 'Trefflich, Friederike', 'Rummel-Kluge, Christine']","['Kalckreuth S', 'Trefflich F', 'Rummel-Kluge C']","['Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Faculty of Medicine, Leipzig University, Semmelweissstrasse 10, Leipzig, 04103, Germany. christine.rummel-kluge@medizin.uni-leipzig.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141224,England,BMC Psychiatry,BMC psychiatry,100968559,IM,"['Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Internet/*statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*psychology', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Education as Topic/methods', '*Social Networking', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC4299476,,,,2015/01/21 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2015/01/21 06:00'],"['2014/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['s12888-014-0368-7 [pii]', '368 [pii]', '10.1186/s12888-014-0368-7 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Psychiatry. 2014 Dec 24;14:368. doi: 10.1186/s12888-014-0368-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: To carry out a comprehensive review of relevant published literature to inform diplomatic organizations that deploy staff in high-threat postings (HTPs). METHODS: We searched appropriate scientific databases for studies relevant to deployment length, mental health and well-being for diplomats. A systematic review related to military personnel was found and used as the foundation for the literature review. Other relevant papers identified by the search have also been included. RESULTS: The majority of identified papers had examined military personnel. Results suggested that longer deployments were associated with poorer mental health including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and alcohol problems and this was most likely to be a function of increased exposure to potentially traumatic events. Exceeding a threshold of 6-12 months within a 3 year period, for military personnel, appeared to elevate the risk of psychosocial problems. Furthermore, diplomats deploying on their first HTP, and those whose tour length is altered after deployment, could be especially vulnerable. CONCLUSIONS: While further research of this topic is required, this review provides an evidence-based insight into the increased risks of developing mental health problems when deployed to HTPs. This information is relevant to generating policies, which may reduce the impacts of adverse psychosocial effects on diplomatic staff and their families.","['Dunn, R', 'Williams, R', 'Kemp, V', 'Patel, D', 'Greenberg, N']","['Dunn R', 'Williams R', 'Kemp V', 'Patel D', 'Greenberg N']","[""King's Centre for Military Mental Health, King's College London, Weston Education Centre, London SE5 9RJ, UK, rebecca.r.dunn@kcl.ac.uk."", 'Welsh Institute of Health and Social Care, University of South Wales, Pontypridd CF37 1DL, UK.', 'Health Planning Ltd, Reading, Berkshire, RG6 1QB, UK.', 'Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London SW1A 2AH, UK.', ""King's College London, London, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20141018,England,Occup Med (Lond),"Occupational medicine (Oxford, England)",9205857,IM,"['Depressive Disorder/etiology/psychology', '*Diplomacy', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Occupational Health/trends', 'Risk Factors', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/etiology/psychology', 'Substance-Related Disorders/etiology/psychology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Deployment length', 'diplomats', 'mental health', 'military', 'occupational exposure.']",2014/10/20 06:00,2016/07/28 06:00,['2014/10/20 06:00'],"['2014/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['kqu142 [pii]', '10.1093/occmed/kqu142 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Med (Lond). 2015 Jan;65(1):32-8. doi: 10.1093/occmed/kqu142.

The aim of this study was to explore non-mental health professionals' conceptions related to the identification of mental illness and perceived treatments, first aid and prognosis. METHODS: In 2014-2015, we presented 1123 non-mental health professionals from six general hospitals in Hunan Province with one of three vignettes describing a person with schizophrenia, depression, or generalized anxiety disorder. Identification rates, beliefs about various interventions, best methods, and the prognosis with or without treatment were measured. RESULTS: Less than 60% of the non-mental health professionals could identify the mental disorders correctly. Psychiatrists and psychologists were considered to be the people who would be most helpful in all vignettes. Over 70% of participants identified the correct medication for each vignette. Participants gave higher ratings to lifestyle interventions than to psychological and medical interventions, especially in the depression and generalized anxiety disorder vignettes. For the question about how the person could best be helped, about half of the participants rated listening or talking with the person more highly than accompanying the person to professional help or encouraging the person to visit a psychiatrist or psychologist. Participants believed that, with professional help, the people in the vignettes would fully recover but that problems would probably reoccur and that, without professional help, the people described would get worse. CONCLUSIONS: The beliefs that non-mental health professionals hold about mental disorders are inadequate to provide appropriate help. There is an urgent need for mental health education campaigns to improve non-mental health professionals' mental health knowledge in mainland China in order to provide better support for mental health service users.","['Wu, Qiuxia', 'Luo, Xiaoyang', 'Chen, Shubao', 'Qi, Chang', 'Long, Jiang', 'Xiong, Yifan', 'Liao, Yanhui', 'Liu, Tieqiao']","['Wu Q', 'Luo X', 'Chen S', 'Qi C', 'Long J', 'Xiong Y', 'Liao Y', 'Liu T']","[""Mental Health Institute of the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, The China National Clinical Research Center for Mental Health Disorders, National Technology Institute of Psychiatry, Key Laboratory of Psychiatry and Mental Health of Hunan Province, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Female Psychiatric Ward, the First Psychiatric Hospital of Hengyang City, Hengyang, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Mental Health Institute of the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, The China National Clinical Research Center for Mental Health Disorders, National Technology Institute of Psychiatry, Key Laboratory of Psychiatry and Mental Health of Hunan Province, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Mental Health Institute of the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, The China National Clinical Research Center for Mental Health Disorders, National Technology Institute of Psychiatry, Key Laboratory of Psychiatry and Mental Health of Hunan Province, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Mental Health Institute of the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, The China National Clinical Research Center for Mental Health Disorders, National Technology Institute of Psychiatry, Key Laboratory of Psychiatry and Mental Health of Hunan Province, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", 'Laboratory for Experimental Psychopathology, Psychological Science Research Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.', ""Mental Health Institute of the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, The China National Clinical Research Center for Mental Health Disorders, National Technology Institute of Psychiatry, Key Laboratory of Psychiatry and Mental Health of Hunan Province, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Mental Health Institute of the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, The China National Clinical Research Center for Mental Health Disorders, National Technology Institute of Psychiatry, Key Laboratory of Psychiatry and Mental Health of Hunan Province, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Mental Health Institute of the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, The China National Clinical Research Center for Mental Health Disorders, National Technology Institute of Psychiatry, Key Laboratory of Psychiatry and Mental Health of Hunan Province, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20170705,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Anxiety Disorders/diagnosis/therapy', 'China', 'Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/therapy', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Literacy/*statistics & numerical data', 'Health Personnel/education/statistics & numerical data', 'Health Promotion/methods', 'Hospitals, General/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/education/*statistics & numerical data', 'Psychiatry/statistics & numerical data', 'Psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia/diagnosis/therapy', '*Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC5498045,,,,2017/07/06 06:00,2017/10/07 06:00,['2017/07/06 06:00'],"['2017/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-17-00008 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0180327 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Jul 5;12(7):e0180327. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0180327. eCollection 2017.,7,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7730-2248'],,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A sample of 3615 adolescents from four cohorts (school grades 5, 7, 9, 11; age range 10-18 years) was recruited from 261 schools, samples of unemployed adolescents (n = 39) and adolescents from mental health institutions (n = 137) were added. The Youth Self-Report and SCOFF were used to screen for mental health problems. In a second phase, the Childrens' Diagnostic Interview for Mental Disorders was used to make point and lifetime psychiatric diagnoses. Mental health service use was also assessed. Point prevalence and lifetime prevalence rates for at least one psychiatric disorder were 23.9% and 35.8%. The highest lifetime prevalence rates were found for anxiety disorders (15.6%), neurodevelopmental disorders (9.3%; ADHD 5.2%) and depressive disorders (6.2%). Forty-seven percent of adolescents with a lifetime psychiatric disorder had a second diagnosis. Internalising disorders were more prevalent in girls, while neurodevelopmental disorders and disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorders were more prevalent in boys. Of those with a lifetime psychiatric disorder, 47.5% had contacted mental health services. Of the residual 52.5% who had not contacted mental health services, 18.1% expressed an interest in treatment. DSM-5 mental health disorders are highly prevalent among Austrian adolescents. Over 50% had or were interested in accessing treatment. Early access to effective interventions for these problems is needed to reduce burden due to mental health disorders.","['Wagner, Gudrun', 'Zeiler, Michael', 'Waldherr, Karin', 'Philipp, Julia', 'Truttmann, Stefanie', 'Dur, Wolfgang', 'Treasure, Janet L', 'Karwautz, Andreas F K']","['Wagner G', 'Zeiler M', 'Waldherr K', 'Philipp J', 'Truttmann S', 'Dur W', 'Treasure JL', 'Karwautz AFK']","['Department for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria. gudrun.wagner@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Department for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute Health Promotion Research, Untere Donaustrasse 47/3, 1020, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute Health Promotion Research, Untere Donaustrasse 47/3, 1020, Vienna, Austria.', 'FernFH Distance - Learning University of Applied Sciences, Zulingergasse 4, 3200, Wiener Neustadt, Austria.', 'Department for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute Health Promotion Research, Untere Donaustrasse 47/3, 1020, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings College University, London, UK.', 'Department for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria. andreas.karwautz@meduniwien.ac.at.']",['eng'],['99901001300/Gemeinsame Gesundheitsziele - Pharma Master Agreement/'],['Journal Article'],20170524,Germany,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,European child & adolescent psychiatry,9212296,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Austria', 'Child', '*Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*trends']",PMC5701961,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adolescents', 'DSM-5', 'Epidemiology', 'Mental disorders']",2017/05/26 06:00,2018/04/04 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00787-017-0999-6 [pii]', '999 [pii]', '10.1007/s00787-017-0999-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2017 Dec;26(12):1483-1499. doi: 10.1007/s00787-017-0999-6.

There is growing recognition of the co-morbidity among mental and physical health problems impacting heavily on health care systems. These challenges open many opportunities for transformational change in the expanding field of global mental health. Given the growing evidence for the wide applicability and efficacy of specific components included in mental health treatment packages, research should focus more on improving the organization and efficiency with which we deliver these specific treatment components already proven to be efficacious. The Latin American Treatment and Innovation Network in Mental Health (LATIN-MH) is a research and training Hub based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Lima, Peru. It aims to address the co-morbidity between physical and mental chronic diseases, exploring the opportunity to use technology to support the treatment of these conditions.

METHOD: Between November 2007 and July 2009, a nationally representative face-to-face survey was conducted using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0 among 6,646 subjects aged 18-64. Trends in 12-month prevalence of mental disorders were examined with these data and NEMESIS-1 data from 1996 (n = 7,076). RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence estimates in NEMESIS-2 were 20.2% for mood, 19.6% for anxiety, 19.1% for substance use disorder and 9.2% for impulse-control disorder. For 12-month disorders, these figures were 6.1, 10.1, 5.6 and 2.1%, respectively. Between 1996 and 2007-2009, the 12-month prevalence of anxiety and substance use disorder did not change. The prevalence of mood disorder decreased slightly but lost significance after controlling for differences in sociodemographic variables between the two studies. CONCLUSION: This study shows that in the Netherlands mental disorders are prevalent.

The article discusses how the United States is trying to eliminate the financial discrimination suffered by patients with mental health disorders, and concludes with public policy recommendations for Chile.","['Errazuriz, Paula', 'Valdes, Camila', 'Vohringer, Paul A', 'Calvo, Esteban']","['Errazuriz P', 'Valdes C', 'Vohringer PA', 'Calvo E']",,['spa'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Chile,Rev Med Chil,Revista medica de Chile,0404312,IM,"['Chile', 'Financing, Government/economics/*organization & administration', 'Health Policy/*economics', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*economics/trends', 'Suicide/statistics & numerical data']",,,,,2015/11/05 06:00,2016/03/24 06:00,['2015/11/05 06:00'],"['2013/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0034-98872015000900011 [pii]', '10.4067/S0034-98872015000900011 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Chil. 2015 Sep;143(9):1179-86. doi: 10.4067/S0034-98872015000900011.,9,,,,,Financiamiento de la salud mental en Chile: una deuda pendiente.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to characterize the physical and mental health of a military trainer cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All US Air Force military training instructors (MTIs) who served between 1 October 2011 and 30 September 2016 were included in this retrospective descriptive study. All International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revision codes received by MTIs as inpatients or outpatients in the TRICARE system were obtained and mapped to Clinical Classifications Software levels. After excluding routine and administrative codes, the relative burden of disease by diagnostic category and subcategory was calculated, with further classification of musculoskeletal conditions by anatomic site. For all conditions accounting for at least 1.0% of the burden of care, incidence density rates and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to compare males and females. RESULTS: A total of 1,269 MTIs received 32,601 non-administrative, non-routine diagnoses while accumulating 50,376 person-months of exposure during the surveillance period. Musculoskeletal conditions were the greatest contributor to overall disease burden, accounting for 39.1% of all diagnoses, followed by mental health (10.4%), respiratory (10.1%), and neurologic and sensory (9.8%). The burden attributed to mental health conditions decreased by 54% over the 5-year period. Twenty-three conditions accounted for at least 1.0% of the healthcare burden. The highest incidence conditions were connective tissue disease (27.18 per 1,000 person-months), non-traumatic joint disorders (25.74), upper respiratory infections (25.14), and back pain (23.70). As compared to males, females had a higher incidence of several conditions, including adjustment disorders (IRR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.61, 4.11) and anxiety disorders (IRR: 2.24; 95% CI: 1.33, 3.77). CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal conditions are the leading contributor to burden of care among US Air Force MTIs, followed by mental health, respiratory, and neurologic and sensory conditions. The burden of healthcare among US Air Force MTIs more closely resembles active component service members than recruit trainees.","['Webber, Bryant J', 'Flower, Alan M', 'Pathak, Sonal R', 'Burganowski, Rachael P', 'Pawlak, Mary T', 'Gottfredson, Ryan C', 'White, Brian K', 'Young, James A']","['Webber BJ', 'Flower AM', 'Pathak SR', 'Burganowski RP', 'Pawlak MT', 'Gottfredson RC', 'White BK', 'Young JA']","['Public Health and Preventive Medicine Department, U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, 2510 5th Street, Building 840, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.', 'Public Health and Preventive Medicine Department, U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, 2510 5th Street, Building 840, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.', 'DataRev LLC, 115 Biscayne Drive NW, #D3, Atlanta, GA.', 'Solutions Through Innovative Technologies, Inc., 3152 Presidential Drive, Fairborn, OH.', 'Public Health and Preventive Medicine Department, U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, 2510 5th Street, Building 840, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.', 'Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, Department of Energy, 1299 Bethel Valley Road, Oak Ridge, TN.', 'Trainee Health Surveillance, 559th Medical Group, 1940 Carswell Avenue, Building 7002, JBSA-Lackland, TX.', 'Trainee Health Surveillance, 559th Medical Group, 1940 Carswell Avenue, Building 7002, JBSA-Lackland, TX.', '559th Medical Group, 1940 Carswell Avenue, Building, JBSA-Lackland, TX.', 'Military Training Consult Service, 737th Training Group, 1618 Truemper Street, JBSA-Lackland, TX.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Mil Med,Military medicine,2984771R,IM,"['Adult', 'Faculty/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology', 'Mental Health/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Military Personnel/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Teaching/psychology/standards', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Military training', 'epidemiology', 'occupational health', 'training instructor']",2019/01/29 06:00,2020/02/25 06:00,['2019/01/29 06:00'],"['2018/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['5299212 [pii]', '10.1093/milmed/usy418 [doi]']",ppublish,Mil Med. 2019 May 1;184(5-6):e248-e254. doi: 10.1093/milmed/usy418.,5-6,,,,"['Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military', 'Surgeons of the United States 2019.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this important problem, the Coalition on Psychiatric Emergencies convened a research consensus conference in December 2016 consisting of clinical researchers, clinicians from emergency medicine, psychiatry and psychology, and representatives from governmental agencies and patient advocacy groups. METHODS: Participants used a standardized methodology to select and rank research questions in the order of importance to both researchers and patients. RESULTS: Three working groups (geriatrics, substance use disorders, and psychosis) reached consensus on 26 questions within their respective domains. These questions are summarized in this document. CONCLUSION: The research consensus conference is the first of its kind to include non-clinicians in helping identify knowledge gaps in behavioral emergencies. It is hoped that these questions will prove useful to prioritize future research within the specialty.","['Wilson, Michael P', 'Shenvi, Christina', 'Rives, Loren', 'Nordstrom, Kimberly', 'Schneider, Sandra', 'Gerardi, Michael']","['Wilson MP', 'Shenvi C', 'Rives L', 'Nordstrom K', 'Schneider S', 'Gerardi M']","['University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Department of Emergency Medicine, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'University of North Carolina, Department of Emergency Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'American College of Emergency Physicians, Irving, Texas.', 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, Denver, Colorado.', 'American College of Emergency Physicians, Irving, Texas.', 'John Peter Smith Hospital, Department of Emergency Medicine, Fort Worth, Texas.', 'Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York.', 'Morristown Memorial Hospital, Morristown, New Jersey.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190219,United States,West J Emerg Med,The western journal of emergency medicine,101476450,IM,"['*Consensus', 'Emergency Medicine/*education/statistics & numerical data', '*Geriatrics', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*education/statistics & numerical data', '*Psychotic Disorders', '*Substance-Related Disorders', 'United States']",PMC6404701,,,,2019/03/19 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/03/19 06:00'],"['2018/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['wjem-20-380 [pii]', '10.5811/westjem.2019.1.39260 [doi]']",ppublish,West J Emerg Med. 2019 Mar;20(2):380-385. doi: 10.5811/westjem.2019.1.39260.

However, the heterogeneous nature of the construct makes it difficult to get a clear picture of the evidence concerning the association between SC indices and mental health. This review examines how SC is conceptualized and measured, and the relationships with other variables in quantitative empirical studies investigating the associations between SC and mental health in post-disaster and post-conflict contexts. It includes primary data studies focusing on this association in civilian populations. Studies were identified by searching electronic databases, bibliographic mining, cited reference searching, and personal contact with experts. In total, 15 studies were included: 12 in post-natural disaster contexts and 3 in conflict-affected settings. Findings suggested that individual cognitive SC had an inverse association with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression, and that ecological cognitive SC was positively associated with mental well-being. Individual structural SC (in the form of community networks) may be psychologically protective. However, most of the evidence was cross-sectional, limiting conclusions about causal relationships. More clarity and consistency is needed in the conceptualization and measurement of SC in order to inform post-crisis mental health interventions.

Fourteen research articles that focused on the mental health of military partners, which directly influence the psychological well-being of veteran partners, were reviewed. Findings indicate that a range of mental health concerns exist among veteran partners living with veterans with PTSD. The mental well-being of veteran partners is affected by the emotional strain of living and caring for veterans with PTSD. For years, the partner's presence has been overlooked in the PTSD treatment. However, to promote the comprehensive health of veterans with PTSD, it is paramount to understand the mental health state of veteran partners. Understanding the mental health state of veteran partners will provide a broader perspective to the plight of veteran partners.","['Yambo, Teresa', 'Johnson, Mary']","['Yambo T', 'Johnson M']","['Teresa Yambo, MSN Ed, Rush University, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140117,United States,J Am Psychiatr Nurses Assoc,Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association,9507418,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological/physiology', 'Adult', 'Attitude to Health', 'Caregivers/psychology', 'Combat Disorders/*psychology', 'Emotions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Internationality', 'Mental Disorders/psychology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Spouses/*psychology', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*psychology', 'Stress, Psychological/psychology', 'Veterans/*psychology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['integrative review', 'military partner', 'posttraumatic stress disorder', 'spouse']",2014/01/21 06:00,2014/10/15 06:00,['2014/01/21 06:00'],"['2014/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1078390313516998 [pii]', '10.1177/1078390313516998 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Psychiatr Nurses Assoc. 2014 Jan-Feb;20(1):31-41. doi: 10.1177/1078390313516998.

Seeking a philosophical viewpoint to surmount these problems, the present paper argues for a value-laden framework for psychiatry with the specific incorporation of value pluralism, particularly in relation to the Global South context, while also emphasizing personal values such as the choice of treatment. In sketching out this framework, the paper aims to overcome the clash between universalism and relativism about psychiatric categories by focusing on how overlaps between cultures can contribute to ontology-building. A case study analyzing ethnopsychiatric research in the context of South India will illustrate the proposed view, while also pointing out avenues for further research on the causal efficacy of local shared beliefs about mental disorder.

Based on this model, this study examined the prevalence and correlates of three mental health categories among older adults in China. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were derived from Wave 1 of the Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health. Participants were categorized into complete mental health (CMH), complete mental illness (CMI), and moderate mental health (MMH) groups. Multinomial logistic regressions were used. RESULTS: The prevalence of CMH, CMI, and MMH in China was 18%, 16%, and 66%, respectively. Being female, unmarried, younger, and feeling unhealthy were more likely to result in placement in the CMI category. Employment, education, and cognitive function were identified as important protective factors of CMH. Age, income, urban or rural residence, and physical function difficulty were associated with all three categories. DISCUSSION: We demonstrated the utility of the two continua model in identifying mental health needs in Chinese contexts. The findings suggest that future policy reforms and clinical interventions should establish a more comprehensive mental health category as a screening tool nationwide. The promotion of social engagement could play an important role in treating mental illness and improving positive mental health.","['Jiang, Nan', 'Lu, Nan']","['Jiang N', 'Lu N']","['a School of Social Work , Columbia University , New York , NY, USA.', 'b Department of Social Work , School of Sociology and Population Studies, Renmin University of China , Beijing , China.']",['eng'],"['R01 AG034479/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AG034263/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180510,United States,Clin Gerontol,Clinical gerontologist,8300869,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Empirical Research', 'Evidence-Based Practice/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/nursing/*psychology', 'Mental Health/*legislation & jurisprudence/trends', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of Life', 'Social Class', 'Social Support']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chinese older adults', 'mental illness', 'positive mental health', 'two continua model']",2018/05/11 06:00,2020/03/21 06:00,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2018/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07317115.2018.1470589 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Gerontol. 2019 Jan-Feb;42(1):80-89. doi: 10.1080/07317115.2018.1470589.

OBJECTIVES: This systematic review and meta-analysis summarises the prevalence, associated factors and interventions for perinatal mental disorders in migrant women from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). SEARCH STRATEGY: We systematically searched nine electronic databases and the grey literature using a predefined search strategy. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were included if they assessed pregnant or postpartum migrants from LMIC, used a structured tool and a case-control, cross-sectional, cohort or intervention study design. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data was double-extracted. We calculated pooled prevalence of depression and weighted mean anxiety and depression scores. We calculated crude odds ratios from risk factor studies and summarised intervention studies descriptively. MAIN RESULTS: Forty studies were identified from 10 123 references. Pooled prevalence was 31% [95% condidence interval (CI) 23%-40%] for any depressive disorder and 17% (95% CI 12-23%) for major depressive disorder. Previous depression and lower social support were associated with perinatal depression. There were insufficient data to assess the burden of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder or psychosis in this population. CONCLUSIONS: One in three migrant women from LMIC experiences symptoms of perinatal depression. Social support is an important protective factor. Evidence on LMIC women relocating to other LMIC is lacking. Given the adverse consequences of perinatal mental illness on women and their children, further research in low-resource settings is a priority.

Therefore, there is a pressing need for innovation in the prevention of MDEs in the workplace. Electronic mental (e-mental) health programs are a cost-effective approach toward the self-management of stress and emotional issues. E-mental health dropout rate, MDE prevalence, and symptoms greatly vary by sex and age. Thus, the development and implementation of e-mental health programs for the prevention of MDEs need to be examined through a sex and age lens to enhance program use and effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine design feature preferences based on sex and age for an e-mental health program targeted toward depression prevention. METHODS: Household residents across Canada were contacted using the random digit dialing method. 500 women and 511 men who were 18 years and older and who were at high risk of having MDEs were interviewed. Internet use was assessed using questions from the 2012 Canadian Internet Use Survey conducted by Statistics Canada, and preferred design features of e-mental health program questions were developed by the BroMatters team members. The proportions of likely use of specific features of e-mental health programs in women were estimated and compared with those in men using chi-square tests. The comparisons were made overall and by age groups. RESULTS: Men (181/511, 35.4%) and women (211/500, 42.2%) differed significantly in their likelihood of using an e-mental health program. Compared with men (307/489, 62.8%), women (408/479, 85.2%) were more likely to use the internet for medical or health-related information. Women were more likely to use the following design features: practices and exercises to help reduce symptoms of stress and depression (350/500, 70.7%), a self-help interactive program that provides information about stress and work problems (302/500, 61.8%), the ability to ask questions and receive answers from mental health professionals via email or text message (294/500, 59.9%), and to receive printed materials by mail (215/500, 43.4%). Men preferred to receive information in a video game format (156/511, 30.7%). Younger men (46/73, 63%) and younger women (49/60, 81%) were more likely to access a program through a mobile phone or an app, and younger men preferred having access to information in a video game format. CONCLUSIONS: Factors such as sex and age influenced design feature preferences for an e-mental health program. Working women who are at high risk for MDEs preferred interactive programs incorporating practice and exercise for reducing stress, quality information about work stress, and some guidance from professionals. This suggests that sex and age should be taken into account when designing e-mental health programs to meet the needs of individuals seeking help via Web-based mental health programs and to enhance their use.","['Smail-Crevier, Rachel', 'Powers, Gabrielle', 'Noel, Chelsea', 'Wang, JianLi']","['Smail-Crevier R', 'Powers G', 'Noel C', 'Wang J']","[""Work & Mental Health Research Unit, The Royal's Institute of Mental Health Research, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada."", ""Work & Mental Health Research Unit, The Royal's Institute of Mental Health Research, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada."", ""Work & Mental Health Research Unit, The Royal's Institute of Mental Health Research, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada."", ""Work & Mental Health Research Unit, The Royal's Institute of Mental Health Research, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada."", 'School of Epidemiology and Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190318,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,IM,"['Adult', 'Depressive Disorder, Major/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC6441854,,['NOTNLM'],"['depression', 'internet', 'mental health', 'occupational health', 'preventive health program', 'workplace']",2019/03/19 06:00,2020/02/08 06:00,['2019/03/19 06:00'],"['2018/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['v21i3e11224 [pii]', '10.2196/11224 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2019 Mar 18;21(3):e11224. doi: 10.2196/11224.,3,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0783-5310', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1766-7162', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7330-4078', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1329-914X']",,['Conflicts of Interest: None declared.'],"['(c)Rachel Smail-Crevier, Gabrielle Powers, Chelsea Noel, JianLi Wang.

AIMS: Our aim was to test for associations between childhood adversity or substance misuse and psychiatric disorders among young offenders. METHODS: Sentenced adolescent offenders were recruited from young offenders' institutions or community centres provided by the Chilean National Service for Minors. Psychiatric disorders were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, conducted by trained psychologists. A trained sociologist used an ad hoc interview to collect information about childhood experiences, including parenting, trauma, education and substance misuse. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to analyse data. RESULTS: The most prevalent psychiatric disorders among the 935 participants were marijuana dependence disorder, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders. Substance use disorders were less frequent among young offenders who were serving their sentence in young offenders' institutions than among those serving in community centres and more frequent among those who started to use marijuana at an earlier age. Among other variables, childhood maltreatment was related to major depressive disorder, and maternal death to anxiety disorders. Higher educational status was related to a lower frequency of depressive and anxiety disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that greater efforts must be made to identify vulnerable young people much earlier. Few of these young offenders with mental health problems had been well adjusted in health, education or socially before this period of detention. (c) 2017 The Authors.

RESULTS: Twenty-one studies fulfilled the selection criteria. Of these, nine studies examined mental health diagnoses including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and substance abuse disorders. With one exception, the remaining twelve studies all related to sexually transmitted infections. CONCLUSION: Homeless adolescents are diagnosed with widely varying rates of mental health disorders and high rates of sexually transmitted infection.

Two need definitions are used: ""assessed need,"" as the presence of a mental disorder, and ""perceived need,"" as the subjective perception of a mental health problem. METHODS: Children's mental health need and service contact estimates (from the 2014 Ontario Child Health Study), expenditure data (from government administrative data), and population counts (from the 2011 Canadian Census) were combined to generate formula-based expenditure allocations based on 1) population size and 2) need (population size adjusted for levels of need). Allocations were compared at the service area and region level and for the 2 need definitions (assessed and perceived). RESULTS: Comparisons were made for 13 of 33 MCYS service areas and all 5 regions. The percentage of MCYS expenditure reallocation needed to achieve an allocation based on assessed need was 25.5% at the service area level and 25.6% at the region level. Based on perceived need, these amounts were 19.4% and 27.2%, respectively. The value of needs-adjustment ranged from 8.0% to 22.7% of total expenditures, depending on the definition of need. CONCLUSION: Making needs adjustments to population counts using population estimates of children's mental health need (assessed or perceived) provides additional value for informing and evaluating allocation decisions. This study provides much-needed and current information about the match between expenditures and children's mental health need.","['Duncan, Laura', 'Georgiades, Katholiki', 'Birch, Stephen', 'Comeau, Jinette', 'Wang, Li', 'Boyle, Michael H']","['Duncan L', 'Georgiades K', 'Birch S', 'Comeau J', 'Wang L', 'Boyle MH']","['1 Offord Centre for Child Studies & Department of Psychiatry & Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario.', '2 Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence & Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', '1 Offord Centre for Child Studies & Department of Psychiatry & Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario.', '3 Department of Economics, McMaster University, Hamilton Ontario, Canada.', ""4 Department of Sociology, King's University College at Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."", ""5 Children's Health and Therapeutics, Children's Health Research Institute, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."", '1 Offord Centre for Child Studies & Department of Psychiatry & Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario.', '2 Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence & Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', '1 Offord Centre for Child Studies & Department of Psychiatry & Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario.', ""6 (in alphabetical order) Tracie O.

AIMS: The aim of this paper is to outline a framework for examining discrimination affecting mentally disordered offenders. It is argued that there should be systematic comparisons between offenders with mental disorder and nonoffenders with mental disorder in order to identify and characterise specific failures to ensure equivalence of mental health care; and systematic comparisons between offenders with mental disorder and offenders without mental disorder in order to identify how mental disorder may constitute a barrier to forms of support and constructive intervention available to other offenders. METHODS: A critical review was conducted of official documents presenting criminal justice and mental health policy for England and Wales, principally since 2012, together with reports of inspectorate and oversight bodies and relevant research studies. FINDINGS: There is evidence that offenders with mental disorder may not be able to access mental health care equivalent to that for nonoffenders with mental disorder. There is also evidence that they may not be able to access interventions available to other offenders. Further disadvantage may arise in the criminal courts since, in England and Wales, if inpatient care is required, the powers of criminal courts to effect hospital admission under Part III of mental health legislation are weakened by the statutory requirement of information that places are available. This is discriminatory against offenders with mental disorder insofar as forms of court disposal for other offenders are not prevented by the capacity of criminal justice agencies. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The review supports the need for systematic comparisons to identify forms of disadvantage and discrimination experienced by mentally disordered offenders in relation to both mental health and criminal justice policies services.","['Grounds, Adrian']",['Grounds A'],"['Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190902,England,Crim Behav Ment Health,Criminal behaviour and mental health : CBMH,9309668,IM,"['*Criminal Law/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Criminals/*psychology', '*Discrimination, Psychological', 'England', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*psychology', 'Mental Health/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Mental Health Services/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Wales']",,,,,2019/09/04 06:00,2019/10/11 06:00,['2019/09/04 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbm.2126 [doi]'],ppublish,Crim Behav Ment Health. 2019 Aug;29(4):247-255. doi: 10.1002/cbm.2126.

In Australia, responsibility for reviewing this legislation falls under the jurisdiction of State and Territory Governments, resulting in interstate variations of legislative definitions and care requirements. In this paper, we outline some of the main differences between MHAs, and argue that it is time for Australia to enact nationally consistent Mental Health Legislation. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial divergence exists between definitions of mental illness and mental disorder, differing criteria for involuntary treatment and discrepancies between treatment requirements for Indigenous Australians. While variations between MHAs are understandable considering the historical context, in an increasingly integrated society, it is time for Australia to enact nationally consistent mental health legislation.","['Tosson, Daniel', 'Lam, Danny', 'Raeburn, Toby']","['Tosson D', 'Lam D', 'Raeburn T']","['34378Liverpool Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', '71507Royal Darwin Hospital, Darwin, NT, Australia.', '97581University of Notre Dame Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20220804,England,Australas Psychiatry,Australasian psychiatry : bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists,9613603,IM,"['Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Australia', '*Mental Disorders/therapy', '*Psychotic Disorders']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['indigenous', 'legislation', 'mental health act']",2022/08/05 06:00,2022/12/02 06:00,['2022/08/04 05:04'],"['2022/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/12/02 06:00 [medline]', '2022/08/04 05:04 [entrez]']",['10.1177/10398562221116290 [doi]'],ppublish,Australas Psychiatry. 2022 Dec;30(6):743-745. doi: 10.1177/10398562221116290.

This paper aims to provide a practical guide to costing approaches across a wide range of care inputs and illness consequences relevant to the treatment of mental health. The resources needed to deliver mental health interventions are highly variable and depend on treatment settings (institutional, community), treatment providers (medical, non-medical) and formats (individual, group, electronic). Establishing the most appropriate perspective is crucial when assessing the costs associated with a particular mental health problem or when evaluating interventions to treat them. We identify five key cost categories (social care, informal care, production losses, crime and education) impacted by mental health and discuss contemporary issues in resource use measurement and valuation, including data sources and resource use instruments.","['Shearer, James', 'McCrone, Paul', 'Romeo, Renee']","['Shearer J', 'McCrone P', 'Romeo R']","[""King's Health Economics, King's College London, London, UK."", 'Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, UK.', ""King's Health Economics, King's College London, London, UK. paul.mccrone@kcl.ac.uk."", 'Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, UK. paul.mccrone@kcl.ac.uk.', ""King's Health Economics, King's College London, London, UK."", 'Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,,"['Costs and Cost Analysis', '*Health Care Costs', 'Health Resources/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/economics/*therapy', 'Mental Health/*economics']",,,,,2016/02/29 06:00,2017/10/14 06:00,['2016/02/29 06:00'],"['2016/02/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s40273-016-0390-3 [pii]', '10.1007/s40273-016-0390-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2016 Jul;34(7):651-64. doi: 10.1007/s40273-016-0390-3.,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Second, it argues that the development of university health services made students increasingly visible, endorsing the view that higher education posed distinctive yet shared mental challenges to young people. The article charts the expansion of services and maps the implications of the visibility of student mental distress for post-war British universities.

We examined whether veterans residing in rural areas have lower mental health service use and poorer mental health status. METHODS: Veterans with at least 1 warzone deployment in central and northeastern Pennsylvania were randomly selected for an interview. Mental health status, including PTSD, major depression, alcohol abuse and mental health global severity, were assessed using structured interviews. Psychiatric service use was based on self-reported utilization in the past 12 months. Results were compared between veterans residing in rural and non-rural areas. Data were also analyzed using multivariate logistic regression to minimize the influence by confounding factors. RESULTS: A total of 1730 subjects (55% of the eligible veterans) responded to the survey and 1692 of them had complete geocode information. Those that did not have this information (n = 38), were excluded from some analyses. Veterans residing in rural areas were older, more often of the white race, married, and experienced fewer stressful events. In comparison to those residing in non-rural areas, veterans residing in rural areas had lower global mental health severity scores; they also had fewer mental health visits. In multivariate logistic regression, rural residence was associated with lower service use, but not with PTSD, major depression, alcohol abuse, and global mental health severity score after adjusting confounding factors (e.g., age, gender, marital status and education). CONCLUSIONS: Rural residence is associated with lower mental health service use, but not with poor mental health in veterans with former warzone deployment, suggesting rural residence is possibly protective.","['Boscarino, Joseph J', 'Figley, Charles R', 'Adams, Richard E', 'Urosevich, Thomas G', 'Kirchner, H Lester', 'Boscarino, Joseph A']","['Boscarino JJ', 'Figley CR', 'Adams RE', 'Urosevich TG', 'Kirchner HL', 'Boscarino JA']","['Clinical Psychology Department, William James College, Newton, MA, 02459, USA.', 'School of Social Work, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, 70112, USA.', 'Department of Sociology, Kent State University, Kent, OH, 44242, USA.', 'Ophthalmology Service, Geisinger Clinic, Mount Pocono, PA, 18344, USA.', 'Department of Population Health Sciences, Geisinger Clinic, 100 N.

However, recent epidemiological and clinical research suggests that not all threshold-level psychoses are likely to occur homotypically; early-stage non-psychotic syndromes might exhibit heterotypic shifts to a first episode of psychosis, without an identifiable at-risk mental state. These findings, along with the relevance of outcomes beyond traditional diagnoses or syndromes, have substantive implications for developing next-generation early intervention infrastructures. Along with the idea of general at-risk clinics for early-stage pluripotential syndromes, we examine how this reality might affect service design, such as the need for close linkage with centres of expertise for threshold-level disorders when transitions to later stages occur, the balance between generic and specific interventions amid the need for person-centred care, and the challenges this reorientation might pose for broader mental health systems.","['Shah, Jai L', 'Jones, Nev', 'van Os, Jim', 'McGorry, Patrick D', 'Guloksuz, Sinan']","['Shah JL', 'Jones N', 'van Os J', 'McGorry PD', 'Guloksuz S']","['Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychosis (PEPP)-Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; ACCESS Open Minds, Douglas Hospital Research Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.

The development of coordinated research policies and integrated research networks in mental health is lagging behind other disciplines in Europe, resulting in lower degree of cooperation and scientific impact. To reduce more efficiently the burden of mental disorders in Europe, a concerted new research agenda is necessary. The ROAMER (Roadmap for Mental Health Research in Europe) project, funded under the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme, aims to develop a comprehensive and integrated mental health research agenda within the perspective of the European Union (EU) Horizon 2020 programme, with a translational goal, covering basic, clinical and public health research. ROAMER covers six major domains: infrastructures and capacity building, biomedicine, psychological research and treatments, social and economic issues, public health and well-being. Within each of them, state-of-the-art and strength, weakness and gap analyses were conducted before building consensus on future research priorities.

Between December 2006 and March 2007, we conducted a questionnaire survey among fourth-year medical students at 20 randomly selected medical schools in Japan. The data from 1,619 students (response rate: 90.6%; male: 1,074; female: 545) were analyzed. We used the Japanese version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to measure mental health status. Poor mental health status (GHQ-12 score of 4 points or higher) was observed in 36.6% and 48.8% of the male and female medical students, respectively. The ratio of the age-adjusted prevalence of poor mental health status in female versus male medical students was 1.33 (95% confidence interval: 1.10-1.62). The universities were categorized into two groups based on the university type (national/public: 15 vs. private: 5) or location (in a large city: 7 vs. in a local city: 13 cities). The prevalence of poor mental health status in both men and women differed between these groups, although not significantly. The GHQ-12 scores in men significantly differed between the categorized groups of universities. These results suggest that adequate attention must be paid to the mental health of medical students, especially females, and that a system for providing mental health care for medical students must be established in the context of actual conditions at each university.","['Ohtsu, Tadahiro', 'Kaneita, Yoshitaka', 'Osaki, Yoneatsu', 'Kokaze, Akatsuki', 'Ochiai, Hirotaka', 'Shirasawa, Takako', 'Nanri, Hinako', 'Ohida, Takashi']","['Ohtsu T', 'Kaneita Y', 'Osaki Y', 'Kokaze A', 'Ochiai H', 'Shirasawa T', 'Nanri H', 'Ohida T']","['Department of Public Health, Showa University School of Medicine, Tokyo 142-8555, Japan.tohtsu@med.showa-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Acta Med Okayama,Acta medica Okayama,0417611,IM,"['Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Prevalence', 'Sex Factors', 'Students, Medical/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,,,2014/12/19 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2014/12/19 06:00'],"['2014/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.18926/AMO/53022 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Med Okayama. 2014 Dec;68(6):331-7. doi: 10.18926/AMO/53022.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are witnessing a daily increase in the number of migrants when people are fleeing from their homes because of human rights violations, persecution, poverty, and conflict. When found in ""host"" countries, they often encounter bad conditions, with uncertainty and instability. Many come to Europe in search of economic and personal opportunities for progress, where they face different types of process of acculturation. 'Place loss', acute and chronic trauma, family disorders, and family reunification issues became more and more important issues. Refugees, asylum seekers and irregular migrants have a higher risk for certain mental health disorders, including posttraumatic stress, depression and psychosis. In addition to being exposed to various risk factors for mental disorders, migrants often face barriers to access to adequate health care to address these issues. Some of the biggest challenges for migrant populations within ""host"" countries include: lack of knowledge of health care rights and health systems; poor knowledge of the language; different belief systems and cultural expectations of health care; and the general lack of trust in experts and in government. The rates of depressive and anxiety disorders usually increase over time, and poor mental health is associated with poor socioeconomic conditions - particularly with social isolation and unemployment. Acculturative stress often implies a high discrepancy in the acculturation between parents and their children. This dislocation of families in new conditions has been caused by the different degrees of acceptance of ""new culture"" by children and parents, which causes serious difficulties, especially in bilingual terms.","['Hasanovic, Mevludin', 'Smigalovic, Dina', 'Fazlovic, Magbula']","['Hasanovic M', 'Smigalovic D', 'Fazlovic M']","['Department of Psychiatry, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Ul.

This study aimed to: 1. Describe service arrangements for older people's mental health; 2. Describe mental health service use from age 65, where data is available. METHODS: DHBs were surveyed to determine mental health service delivery and funding models for adults aged 65 and older. PRIMHD was used to explore demographic and clinical characteristics of older people using mental health services in Northern and Midland DHBs between 2009 and 2015. RESULTS: DHBs vary in funding, access and reporting arrangements for older people's mental health services. Most services provide information into PRIMHD, but this is often partially complete. In the Northern and Midland regions, 2.2 % of older adults access specialist mental health services. People aged 65-74 were more likely to have previously used mental health services, live in deprived areas, have functional mental health conditions and have high treatment intensity than older age groups. CONCLUSIONS: National consistency in data collection and service delivery for older people is needed. Further investigation is needed to understand the needs of people with prior mental health service contact.","['Cunningham, Ruth', 'Peterson, Debbie', 'Sims, Adam']","['Cunningham R', 'Peterson D', 'Sims A']","['Senior Research Fellow and Public Health Physician, Department of Public Health, University of Otago, Wellington.', 'Senior Research Fellow, Department of Public Health, University of Otago, Wellington.', 'Psychiatrist for Older People, Capital and Coast DHB, Wellington.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190201,New Zealand,N Z Med J,The New Zealand medical journal,0401067,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Health Services Accessibility/*standards', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology/therapy', 'Mental Health/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Mental Health Services/*organization & administration', 'Models, Organizational', 'Needs Assessment', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', 'Quality of Health Care']",,,,,2019/02/01 06:00,2019/10/24 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,N Z Med J. 2019 Feb 1;132(1489):30-38.,1489,,,['Nil.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about how often patients with personality disorder are detained or how this compares with the treatment of other mental disorders. OBJECTIVES: Our aim is to test the hypothesis that people with personality disorder are infrequently detained under the Mental Health Act (MHA) and that risk factors associated with detention are the same as those for people with other mental disorders. METHOD: We used a retrospective, quantitative study of MHA assessments. RESULTS: Of the 2 087 assessments undertaken, 204 (9.8%) patients had a diagnosis of personality disorder; 40.7% of assessments in the personality disorder group resulted in detention, as did 69.7% of patients with other mental disorders. A higher proportion of people with personality disorder received no intervention following assessment compared with those with other mental disorders (20.6% vs. 4.7%, p < 0.001). Study centre and a history of admission were risk factors for detention in both groups. Risk was a predictor of detention in those with other mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Detention rates in patients with personality disorder are lower than those for other disorders but are still substantial. Risk factors for detention in patients with personality disorder differ from those with other mental disorders.

This study sought to explore the relationship between retirement and mental health across older adulthood, whilst considering age and known risk factors for mental disorders. Data were from the 1997 National Survey of Mental Health and Well-being, a cross-sectional survey of 10,641 Australian adults. The prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders was analysed in the sub-sample of men (n = 1928) and women (n = 2261) aged 45-74 years. Mental health was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Instrument. Additional measures were used to assess respondents' physical health, demographic and personal characteristics. The prevalence of common mental disorders diminished across increasing age groups of men and women. Women aged 55-59, 65-69, and 70-74 had significantly lower rates of mental disorders than those aged 45-49. In contrast, only men aged 65-69 and 70-74 demonstrated significantly lower prevalence compared with men aged 45-49. Amongst younger men, retirees were significantly more likely to have a common mental disorder relative to men still in the labour force; however, this was not the case for retired men of, or nearing, the traditional retirement age of 65. Men and women with poor physical health were also more likely to have a diagnosable mental disorder. The findings of this study indicate that, for men, the relationship between retirement and mental health varies with age.

Its originality is seen in the fact that practically all speaking and writing about it noted the importance of this principle for the protection of rights and legal interests of citizens, failing into the field of psychiatry. However, expressing this opinion, doctors and lawyers offer very few arguments in support of this view. Traditional arguments in favor of the presumption of mental health, scattered and unsystematic, prove to be absolutely insolvent. It was also found out that the similarity of the presumption of mental health with the presumption of innocence is capable to entail negative consequences. The noted similarity strengthens stigmatizing effect of psychiatric diagnosis, making it extremely undesirable for the patient, and the basis of the relationship between the patient and the doctor laid counterproductive antagonistic model as the model of mutual relations of the accused with the prosecutor. The main conclusion of authors is that the supporters of the presumption of mental health have yet to prove its right to exist, to work out its content and try to neutralize some of the negative consequences of its possible implementation in practice. Without compliance with the listed conditions to bring the presumption of mental health to the level of one of the fundamental principles of Russian psychiatry would be premature.","['Shishkov, S N', 'Skibina, N V']","['Shishkov SN', 'Skibina NV']","['Serbsky Federal Medical Research Centre for Psychiatry and Narcology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, Moscow, Russia.']",['rus'],,['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova,Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

Data from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health were examined. A total of 63,997 children had data for both parental reported mental health and bullying status. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression was performed to assess the association between mental health status and being identified as a bully with an age-stratified analysis and sub-analysis by type of mental health disorder. In 2007, 15.2% of U.S. children ages 6 to 17 years were identified as bullies by their parent or guardian. Children with a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, or depression had a threefold increased odds of being a bully. The diagnosis of depression is associated with a 3.31 increased odds (95% CI = [2.7, 4.07]) of being identified as a bully. Children with anxiety and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) had similar odds. The diagnosis of a mental health disorder is strongly associated with being identified as a bully. In particular, depression, anxiety, and ADHD are strongly associated with being identified as a bully. These findings emphasize the importance of providing psychological support to not only victims of bullying but bullies as well. Understanding the risk profile of childhood bullies is essential in gaining a better grasp of this public health problem and in creating useful and appropriate resources and interventions to decrease bullying.","['Benedict, Frances Turcotte', 'Vivier, Patrick M', 'Gjelsvik, Annie']","['Benedict FT', 'Vivier PM', 'Gjelsvik A']","['Department of Emergency Medicine, Section of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI, USA frances_turcotte_benedict@brown.edu.', 'Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Brown University, School of Public Health, Providence, RI, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140611,United States,J Interpers Violence,Journal of interpersonal violence,8700910,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anxiety/epidemiology/psychology', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/epidemiology/psychology', '*Bullying', 'Child', 'Depression/epidemiology/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/*psychology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['bullying', 'mental health and violence', 'youth violence']",2014/06/13 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2014/06/13 06:00'],"['2014/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['0886260514536279 [pii]', '10.1177/0886260514536279 [doi]']",ppublish,J Interpers Violence. 2015 Mar;30(5):782-95. doi: 10.1177/0886260514536279.

The psycho-immune-neuroendocrine (PINE) network details metabolomic pathways which are responsive to varied stressors and link chronic medical conditions with mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder via a network of pathophysiological pathways. The primary objective of this review is to explore evidence of relationships between airborne particulate matter (PM, as a concrete example of a physical environmental stressor), the PINE network and chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including mental health sequelae, with a view to supporting the assertion that physical environmental stressors (not only psychosocial stressors) disrupt the PINE network, leading to NCDs. Biological links have been established between PM exposure, key sub-networks of the PINE model and mental health sequelae, suggesting that in theory, long-term mental health impacts of PM exposure may exist, driven by the disruption of these biological networks. This disruption could trans-generationally influence health; however, long-term studies and information on chronic outcomes following acute exposure event are still lacking, limiting what is currently known beyond the acute exposure and all-cause mortality. More empirical evidence is needed, especially to link long-term mental health sequelae to PM exposure, arising from PINE pathophysiology. Relationships between physical and psychosocial stressors, and especially the concept of such stressors acting together to impact on PINE network function, leading to linked NCDs, evokes the concept of syndemics, and these are discussed in the context of the PINE network.","['Stapelberg, Nicolas J C', 'Branjerdporn, Grace', 'Adhikary, Sam', 'Johnson, Susannah', 'Ashton, Kevin', 'Headrick, John']","['Stapelberg NJC', 'Branjerdporn G', 'Adhikary S', 'Johnson S', 'Ashton K', 'Headrick J']","['Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service, Gold Coast, QLD 4215, Australia.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine, Bond University, Gold Coast, QLD 4226, Australia.', 'Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service, Gold Coast, QLD 4215, Australia.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine, Bond University, Gold Coast, QLD 4226, Australia.', 'Mater Young Adult Health Centre, Mater Hospital, Brisbane, QID 4101, Australia.', 'Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service, Gold Coast, QLD 4215, Australia.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine, Bond University, Gold Coast, QLD 4226, Australia.', 'School of Medical Science, Griffith University, Gold Coast, QID 4215, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20221014,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,IM,"['Humans', '*Mental Health', '*Depressive Disorder, Major/psychology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Syndemic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Particulate Matter']",PMC9603079,,['NOTNLM'],"['biological networks', 'biopsychosocial model', 'chronic illness risk network', 'mental health', 'metabolomic pathways', 'non-communicable disease', 'particulate matter', 'psycho-immune-neuroendocrine network', 'syndemic']",2022/10/28 06:00,2022/10/29 06:00,['2022/10/27 01:26'],"['2022/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2022/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2022/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/10/27 01:26 [entrez]', '2022/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph192013226 [pii]', 'ijerph-19-13226 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph192013226 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2022 Oct 14;19(20):13226. doi: 10.3390/ijerph192013226.,20,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6578-2718', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7657-9165']",,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,['0 (Particulate Matter)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper summarises and critically reviews the development of the WHO Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps. The value of social role theory is described followed by a classification of the relevant assessment scales in this field. Mental disorders are in general strongly associated with social dysfunctioning, particularly in schizophrenia and the major affective disorders. For a long time social dysfunctioning was considered an epiphenomenon and just a part of the disease process. Criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder were and still are often derived from the domains of work and social relationships. There are at least two related reasons why social functioning deserves a closer look: 1. There is an increasing trend to treat patients in the community instead of in the hospital: the changing orientation on community care needs careful evaluation with respect to its consequences. To what extent is survival in the community possible and what is the quality of life like there? Are community programs better than hospital treatment, and for whom? Therefore, separate measurement is justified for evaluation of outcome and costs and benefits. 2. There is growing evidence that the courses of symptomatology and social dysfunctioning may vary relatively independently: social disablement of a patient may be characterized much more by social disabilities than by persistent psychiatric symptoms; the former may call for another kind of action than usually available. For example, psychosocial rehabilitation focuses on cognitive and social abilities of the patient which are crucial for a more or less independent life. Therefore, separate measurement is justified for the sake of the right choice of treatment. The usual diagnostic systems such as the ICD and the DSM offer no adequate solution to the problem of classification and assessment of social dysfunctioning as a consequence of mental disorder. We have to look for other classification systems such as the International Classification Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (ICIDH) of the WHO (1980, 1993) which offers a conceptual model to study the long-term consequences in terms of functional disabilities and experienced social handicaps, and the effectiveness of health care to handle these kind of problems.","['Wiersma, D']",['Wiersma D'],"['Department of Social Psychiatry, University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,8804358,IM,"['Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*diagnosis/psychology', '*Mental Health']",,,,,1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00785755 [doi]'],ppublish,Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol. 1996 Jun;31(3-4):101-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00785755.,3-4,,,,,,,,,,,,46,,,,,,,,,,

Defining autism as a disability was more than a change of legal status to guarantee social benefits. It was also a political maneuver, orchestrated by parent associations, aimed to take the responsibility for treatment away from the public mental health network of services. This article examines the controversies that have set parent associations in direct antagonism with mental health professionals in the public health system. We draw from ethnographic data and theoretical discussions in the field of disability studies to situate these controversies within the context of a larger debate on the relationship between health, rights, and citizenship. We found similarities between the ethical and political goals of parent activists and mental health professionals in Brazil, but we argue that the main cause of dissent is the role that each of these social actors assigns to identity politics in their clinical and political projects.","['Rios, Clarice', 'Costa Andrada, Barbara']","['Rios C', 'Costa Andrada B']","['Institute for Social Medicine, State University of Rio de Janeiro, Rua Sao Francisco Xavier 524, Rio De Janeiro, CEP 20550-900, Brazil, clarice.r@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Cult Med Psychiatry,"Culture, medicine and psychiatry",7707467,IM,"['Autistic Disorder/*ethnology', 'Brazil/ethnology', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*ethnology/legislation & jurisprudence', '*Patient Advocacy/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Persons with Mental Disabilities/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Public Policy/*legislation & jurisprudence']",,,,,2015/04/07 06:00,2016/02/16 06:00,['2015/04/06 06:00'],"['2015/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11013-015-9448-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cult Med Psychiatry. 2015 Jun;39(2):213-34. doi: 10.1007/s11013-015-9448-5.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The principal relations among variables were analysed by an chi(2) test, followed by a Z test with Bonferroni's correction. For a global perspective a Multiple Correspondence Analysis was performed. 2 The most frequent disorders were adjustment, anxiety and mood disorders, and in addition there were a large number of patients without diagnosis. The percentage of unemployed or inactive patients was high, as it was for those with a low academic level. The younger patients were more prone to have adjustment disorders, especially among the unemployed ones, while anxiety disorders were more frequent in the patients with jobs. A close association seems to exist between unemployment, low academic level and mental health problems. The high demand for mental health attention reveals a clear need to optimize the utilization of specialized care in mental health.","['Norberto, M J', 'Rodriguez-Santos, L', 'Caceres, M C', 'Montanero, J']","['Norberto MJ', 'Rodriguez-Santos L', 'Caceres MC', 'Montanero J']","['Equipo de Salud Mental Almendralejo.

Results, however support a ""discontinuous perspective: ""no underlying continuum among any of the three concepts. These results suggest that researchers need to avoid the common practice of ""lumping together"" distress, disorder, and mental health and study each in their own right. Subsequent tests attempt to further specify the relationships among these concepts. Results indicate a strong positive directional association from distress to disorder a strong negative directional association from distress to mental health, and no significant relationship between mental health and disorder.

This age group is the peak time of onset for many mental disorders including mood, substance abuse and psychotic disorders. Effective interventions in primary or specialist care are likely to be most cost-effective at this age. Yet in most countries there are few opportunities for young people and their families to gain access to treatment and care for mental ill-health and preventive interventions. This is especially important for young people exposed to trauma and adversity. Few countries give sufficient attention to safeguarding and improving the mental health of young people and few have developed policies and programs to support this. Policy and practice changes suitable for each country have two essential starting points: improved understanding of youth mental health within communities; and involving young people and their families in decisions that affect them. Using information technology to assist care is another desirable feature of modern service development suitable for any environment. New directions and models of care to respond to better awareness and help-seeking and new approaches to health promotion are being developed in several countries, and psychiatrists have a central role in supporting these developments.","['Herrman, Helen', 'Purcell, Rosemary', 'Goldstone, Sherilyn', 'McGorry, Patrick']","['Herrman H', 'Purcell R', 'Goldstone S', 'McGorry P']","['Orygen Youth Health Research Centre, Centre for Youth Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Locked Bag 10 (35 Poplar Road), Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia. h.herrman@unimelb.edu.au']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Croatia,Psychiatr Danub,Psychiatria Danubina,9424753,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*standards/trends', 'Mental Health Services/*standards/trends', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2012/11/02 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/11/02 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Psychiatr Danub. 2012 Oct;24 Suppl 3:S285-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A self-report questionnaire was completed by 255 women recruited from three university campuses. A vignette of a fictional (female) person exhibiting the characteristic features of bulimia nervosa was presented, followed by a series of questions concerning the treatment and outcome of the problem described. A measure of eating disorder symptoms was included in the questionnaire. RESULTS: Consulting a primary care practitioner, counsellor or psychologist; seeking the advice of a (female) family member or friend; getting advice about diet and nutrition; and taking vitamins and minerals were the interventions most often considered helpful. Participants were less positive about the benefits of psychiatristsand were ambivalent about the use of psychotropic medication. Participants' mothers were most often considered helpful as they are an initial source of help. Among participants with a high level of eating disorder symptoms, recognition of an eating problem was poor. A minority of participants believed that treatment would result in full recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Aspects of the eating disorders mental health literacy of young Singaporean women may be conducive to low or inappropriate treatment seeking.

A burgeoning cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental evidence base implicates nutrition in mental health. Healthier diets (e.g., those rich in certain micro-nutrients) may benefit cognitive, social, and emotional functioning through attenuated inflammation and other bio-psychological pathways. The present study examined associations between nutrition and three markers of mental health among immigrants to Canada. METHODS: Employing cross-sectional data from immigrant respondents (n = 37,071) to a nationally representative population-based survey (the Canadian Community Health Survey: CCHS 2011-2014), we modelled associations of daily fruit and vegetable consumption with three mental health outcomes: anxiety and/or mood disorder diagnosis, being distressed (assessed via the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale), and having good self-rated overall mental health. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed, adjusting for various socio-demographic and lifestyle-related variables. RESULTS: Higher consumption of fruit and vegetables demonstrated significant, protective associations with odds of having a mood and/or anxiety disorder, being distressed, and self-rated good mental health. Such patterns of association were similar regardless of ethno-cultural minority status and recency of immigration. Moreover, the protective associations of nutrition and mental health were independent of socio-demographic, health, and lifestyle factors. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggested evidence of protective associations between healthy nutritional intake and mental illness among a large-scale sample of immigrants in Canada. Importantly, the protective associations of healthier diets with immigrants' mental health were independent of various markers of healthy lifestyles (e.g., general health status, physical activity, alcohol use). Healthy dietary intake may, therefore, be worth consideration in efforts to prevent mental illness among immigrants.","['Emerson, Scott D', 'Carbert, Nicole S']","['Emerson SD', 'Carbert NS']","['School of Population and Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. semerson@alumni.ubc.ca.', 'School of Population and Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', ""BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, Canada.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181023,Germany,Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,8804358,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anxiety/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Diet Surveys', 'Diet, Healthy/methods/*psychology', 'Emigrants and Immigrants/*psychology', 'Female', 'Fruit', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Mental Health/ethnology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Mood Disorders/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Protective Factors', 'Vegetables']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Canada', 'Diet', 'Immigration', 'Mental health', 'Nutrition']",2018/10/26 06:00,2019/08/06 06:00,['2018/10/25 06:00'],"['2018/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00127-018-1616-9 [pii]', '10.1007/s00127-018-1616-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol. 2019 May;54(5):567-578. doi: 10.1007/s00127-018-1616-9.

This article is drawn from work done by the ZERO TO THREE Task Force developing the DC:0-5 Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood, specifically dealing with eating disorders in the first 5 years of life. The proposed changes come from both reviewing major studies and reviews published in the last 10 years and reports from clinicians collected through surveys commissioned by the Task Force. The main changes that are proposed include changes in terminology, such as Eating Disorders instead of Feeding Behavior Disorders, as well as focusing on the child's observed eating symptoms rather than on classifying the eating problems by inferred etiologies. Another major change relates to the differentiation between eating disorders that are observed beyond any specific caregiver-child relationship context and those that are confined to one specific relationship. A new category, Overeating Disorder, has been added, as it has been increasingly recognized as a significant and not rare clinical condition. Two illustrative cases are described. The proposed changes in the classification of eating disorders in the first 5 years of life are intended to encourage both clinicians and researchers to study these important disorders in young children.","['Keren, Miri']",['Keren M'],"['Geha Mental Health Center, Tel Aviv University Medical School. ofkeren@zahav.net.il.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160824,United States,Infant Ment Health J,Infant mental health journal,8007859,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Feeding and Eating Disorders/*classification/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mental Health/classification', 'Vocabulary, Controlled']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Futterung', 'Unterernahrung', 'alimentacion', 'alimentation', 'alimentation atypique', 'atypical eating', 'atypisches Essen', 'comer de menos', 'comer de mas', 'feeding', 'habitos atipicos de comida', 'overeating', 'sousalimenation', 'suralimentation', 'undereating', 'ubermassiges Essen/Uberernahrung', '摂食 (哺育) feeding', '過少食 undereating', '過食', '非典型飲食', '非定型摂食', '飲食過多', '飲食過少', '餵養']",2016/08/25 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/08/25 06:00'],"['2016/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/imhj.21588 [doi]'],ppublish,Infant Ment Health J. 2016 Sep;37(5):498-508. doi: 10.1002/imhj.21588.

A stratified cluster sampling method was used to recruit medical students from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China. The questionnaire survey on general information and Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) were used for investigation and analysis. The results showed among the 1137 valid questionnaires, 278 (24.45%) participants had SCL-90 score >/= 160. The top three mental problems of medical students were obsessive-compulsive disorder, interpersonal sensitivity and depression in terms of the factor score >/= 2.5 and the number of participants who reflected on the diseases. The third-year medical students had the worst mental health status, and fifth-year medical students had the best mental health status. Students from rural area had more psychological problems than those from urban area; furthermore, students with high professional satisfaction, those who were the single child of the family, non-poor students, and those whose parents had high education level had better mental health status. It was concluded that the mental health of medical students is not optimistic in China. Medical students have some mental health problems of different degrees. Factors that influence the mental health of medical students include academic pressure, professional satisfaction level and family environment.","['Yang, Fan', 'Meng, Heng', 'Chen, Hui', 'Xu, Xin-Hao', 'Liu, Zhuo', 'Luo, Ai', 'Feng, Zhan-Chun']","['Yang F', 'Meng H', 'Chen H', 'Xu XH', 'Liu Z', 'Luo A', 'Feng ZC']","['School of Medicine and Health Management, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Office of the Student Administration of the Second Clinical College, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Maternal and Child Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Maternal and Child Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Stomatological Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Tongji Medical College, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'School of Medicine and Health Management, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Health and Family Planning Commission of Qinghai Province, Xining, 810000, China.', 'School of Medicine and Health Management, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China. zcfeng@mails.tjmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140618,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

We investigated the relationship between ENS, and anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and somatic symptom disorder (SSD) compared to individuals with chronic rhinitis (CR) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). METHODS: This cross-sectional survey study compared ENS and CR and CRS patients. A total of 116 patients participated: 58 ENS patients from digital support groups, and 58 CRS and CR patients from tertiary rhinology clinics. Study participants completed four validated surveys: (1) Empty Nose Syndrome 6-Item Questionnaire, (2) Rhinosinusitis Disability Index (RSDI), (3) Obsessive Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R), and (4) PRIME MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). RESULTS: ENS patients exhibited a mean RSDI of 78.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 72.8-84.5, compared to 25.2, 95% CI 18.6-31.8 for CRS/CR patients (p < 0.0001). This difference was seen across all subdomains. Using the PHQ, 53% of ENS patients met diagnostic thresholds for SSD compared to 14% of CRS patients (p < 0.0001). In relation to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), 18.37% of ENS patients compared to 8.62% of CRS/CR patients scored above the diagnostic threshold (>21) on the OCI-R questionnaire (p = 0.159). CONCLUSION: ENS patients had diminished sinonasal quality of life and a higher prevalence of comorbid anxiety and depression, compared to CR and CRS. ENS patients were more likely to exceed thresholds for OCD and SSD compared to controls. Future studies are needed to assess the role of SSD in ENS to help optimize treatment for these complex patients.","['Lamb, Meredith', 'Bacon, Daniel R', 'Zeatoun, Abdullah', 'Onourah, Princess', 'Thorp, Brian D', 'Abramowitz, Jonathon', 'Ebert, Charles S Jr', 'Kimple, Adam J', 'Senior, Brent A']","['Lamb M', 'Bacon DR', 'Zeatoun A', 'Onourah P', 'Thorp BD', 'Abramowitz J', 'Ebert CS Jr', 'Kimple AJ', 'Senior BA']","['Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine, Lillington, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Psychology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20220407,United States,Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,International forum of allergy & rhinology,101550261,IM,"['Humans', '*Rhinitis/diagnosis', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Quality of Life', 'Mental Health', '*Sinusitis/epidemiology', 'Syndrome', 'Chronic Disease']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['ENS6Q', 'OCI-R', 'PRIME-MD PHQ', 'RSDI', 'chronic rhinosinusitis', 'empty nose syndrome', 'somatoform disorders']",2022/03/26 06:00,2022/11/16 06:00,['2022/03/25 08:38'],"['2022/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2022/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2022/03/25 08:38 [entrez]']",['10.1002/alr.22997 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Forum Allergy Rhinol. 2022 Nov;12(11):1340-1349. doi: 10.1002/alr.22997.

They regularly witness death and suffering and are at risk of personal injury. Psychiatric sequelae include an increased risk for trauma-related symptoms, depression, alcohol-use disorders, and stress-related medical conditions. Law enforcement officers have been applying for early disability retirement pensions at an increased rate for stress-related psychiatric and medical conditions. As a result, law enforcement agencies are prematurely losing valuable resources, officers with training and experience. Departments have become proactive in trying to address mental health issues to prevent psychiatric disability by implementing employee wellness plans and stress reduction interventions. Programs have been developed to mitigate the effects of stress on law enforcement personnel. Many law enforcement agencies have developed strategies to encourage early confidential referral for psychiatric treatment. They utilize peer support groups and employee assistance programs and develop alliances with mental health professionals. When these approaches fail, a fitness for duty process can be used to identify impairment in work functioning due to psychiatric factors with the prospect of later returning the officer to full duty.

Despite apartheid ending more than 20 years ago, material inequalities remain interwoven with ethnic/racial inequalities. There is limited research on the prevalence/predictors of common mental disorders (CMD) among young people. Adolescence is a unique time-point during which intervention may lead to improved mental health and reduced social problems later. The study objective was to assess mental health disparities in a representative sample of adolescents growing up in South Africa. METHODS: Cross-sectional associations of race/ethnicity and material disadvantage with CMD and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) were assessed in a stratified random sample representative of school-attendees, aged 14-15 years, in a large metropolitan area of Cape Town. Validated instruments assessed mental disorders; these included: Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (PTSD); Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (depression); Zung self-rated anxiety scale (anxiety). Self-ascribed ethnicity was determined using procedures similar to the South African census and previous national surveys. RESULTS: Response rate was 88% (1034 of 1169 individuals). Adolescents experienced a high prevalence of depression (41%), anxiety (16%) and PTSD (21%). A gradient between material disadvantage and CMD/ PTSD was evident across all ethnic/racial groups. Respondents self-identifying as 'black' or 'coloured' were disadvantaged across most indicators. After adjusting for confounders, relative to white children, relative risk (RR) of CMD in black children was 2.27 (95% CI:1.24, 4.15) and for PTSD was RR: 2.21 (95% CI:1.73, 2.83). Relative risk of CMD was elevated in children self-identifying as 'coloured' (RR: 1.73, 95% CI:1.11, 2.70). Putative mediators (violence, racially motivated bullying, social support, self-esteem) partially accounted for differences in CMD and fully for PTSD.

Secondary analysis of 109589 recorded encounters from a national cross-sectional study in Australian general practice (2006-16) demonstrated that encounters involving creation of a care plan for depression or anxiety were significantly higher than those for diabetes, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Rates of review were commensurate with creation of plans for diabetes, but not for mental disorders. Eighteen people with a GP care plan completed an online survey about their experiences, reporting that care plans facilitated access to allied health professionals, but did not improve the quality of care they received. Findings suggest that care plans are underutilised for people with low prevalence mental disorders, and while they offer financial benefits to consumers, they may not result in ongoing, collaborative care.","['Banfield, Michelle', 'Farrer, Louise M', 'Harrison, Christopher']","['Banfield M', 'Farrer LM', 'Harrison C']","['Centre for Mental Health Research, 63 Eggleston Road, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia; and Corresponding author.

The aims of this study are to evaluate impact of a new training course and supervision for community mental health staff to enhance their levels of mental health knowledge and to reduce their stigmatization toward people with mental illness. METHODS: A total of 77 community mental health staff from eight regions in Guangzhou in China were recruited for the study.4 regions were randomly allocated to the new training model group, and 4 to the old training model group. Levels of mental health knowledge were measured by purpose-made assessment schedule and by the Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS). Stigma was evaluated by the Mental Illness: Clinicians' Attitudes Scale (MICA) and the Reported and Intended Behavior Scale (RIBS). Evaluation questionnaires were given at the beginning of course, at the end, and at 6 month and at 12 month follow-up. RESULTS: After the training period, the 6-month, and the 12-month, knowledge scores of the intervention group were higher than the control group. At 6-month and 12-month follow-up, means scores of MAKS of the intervention group increased more than the control group (both p < 0.05) when age, sex, marriage status, title and time were controlled for. At 6-month follow-up, means scores of MICA of the intervention group decreased more than that of the control group (p < 0.01). At after-training, at 6-months, and at 12-months, mean scores of RIBS of the intervention group increased more than the control (p < 0.01, p < 0.001, p < 0.001) when age, sex, marriage status, title and time were controlled for. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the traditional training course and supervision, the new course improved community mental health staff knowledge of mental disorders, improving their attitudes toward people with mental disorder, and increasing their willingness to have contact with people with mental disorder.","['Li, Jie', 'Li, Juan', 'Thornicroft, Graham', 'Yang, Hui', 'Chen, Wen', 'Huang, Yuanguang']","['Li J', 'Li J', 'Thornicroft G', 'Yang H', 'Chen W', 'Huang Y']","['Guangzhou Brain Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, 36# Mingxin Road, Liwan, Guangzhou, 510370, China. biglijie@163.com.', 'Henan Provincial Mental Hospital, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, 388# Jianshe Road, Muye, Xinxiang, 453003, China. ljpsy87@163.com.', ""Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, SE5 8AF, UK. graham.thornicroft@kcl.ac.uk."", 'Guangzhou Brain Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, 36# Mingxin Road, Liwan, Guangzhou, 510370, China. yanghui6009@163.com.', 'Faculty of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University,Sun Yat-sen Center for Migrant Health Policy, 74#Zhongshan Road II, Yuexiu, Guangzhou, 510080, China. chenw43@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'Guangzhou Brain Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, 36# Mingxin Road, Liwan, Guangzhou, 510370, China. yuan2011gz@163.com.']",['eng'],['RP-PG-0606-1053/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151026,England,BMC Psychiatry,BMC psychiatry,100968559,IM,"['Adult', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'China', 'Clinical Competence/standards', 'Community Mental Health Services/standards', 'Curriculum', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Personnel/*education/psychology/standards', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/psychology/therapy', 'Mental Health/*education/standards', 'Primary Health Care/standards', 'Professional-Patient Relations', 'Social Stigma', 'Stereotyping', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC4620640,,,,2015/10/28 06:00,2016/05/10 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12888-015-0660-1 [pii]', '660 [pii]', '10.1186/s12888-015-0660-1 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Psychiatry. 2015 Oct 26;15:263. doi: 10.1186/s12888-015-0660-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific social and financial factors mediate the effects of financial crisis on mental health, such as poverty, financial difficulties and unemployment. During the recent international financial crisis, studies in many countries have shown that the worsening of various mental health indicators was related to financial difficulties and unemployment. In Greece, which is one of the countries that experienced intense and prolonged economic and social burden due to the recent crisis, the epidemiological findings were similar and the increase of the prevalence of major depression and suicide was excessive. However, the information about the mental health of the population deriving from health services is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the crisis on community mental health -more specifically the rates of mental disorders and suicide, as well as the role of unemployment- among the new cases of a community mental health unit. The sample consisted of 1,865 adult users, men and women, who came seeking for help to the Byron-Kessariani Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC) during the years 2008-2013, i.e. the early years of the current crisis. Regarding the rates of the diagnostic categories in the new cases of CMHC per year, no significant differentiation was observed. There was an increase in the proportion of the unemployed individuals in the total sample of new cases during the study, from 9.65% in 2008 to 26.17% in 2013 and a significant association between unemployment and the occurrence of anxiety and depressive disorders, as indicated by the increase in the proportion of unemployed individuals among new cases with disorders of these categories. There was an upward trend in the rate of new patients referred to CMHC after a suicide attempt, which was doubled during the first years of the crisis. There was also an increase in the rate of unemployed individuals among these cases, from 10% in 2008 to 41.7% in 2009, reaching the highest level in 2011 (53.3%). The findings of this study suggest that during economic crisis unemployment plays an important role in the development of anxiety and depressive disorders and is closely related to suicide attempts. Our results were derived from a specific catchment area and therefore they have high ecological validity.","['Konstantakopoulos, G', 'Pikouli, K', 'Ploumpidis, D', 'Bougonikolou, E', 'Kouyanou, K', 'Nystazaki, M', 'Economou, M']","['Konstantakopoulos G', 'Pikouli K', 'Ploumpidis D', 'Bougonikolou E', 'Kouyanou K', 'Nystazaki M', 'Economou M']","['Byron-Kessariani Community Mental Health Centre, First Department of Psychiatry, Athens University Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens, Greece.', ""Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, UK."", 'Byron-Kessariani Community Mental Health Centre, First Department of Psychiatry, Athens University Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Byron-Kessariani Community Mental Health Centre, First Department of Psychiatry, Athens University Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Byron-Kessariani Community Mental Health Centre, First Department of Psychiatry, Athens University Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Byron-Kessariani Community Mental Health Centre, First Department of Psychiatry, Athens University Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Athens University Medical School, General Oncology Hospital of Kifissia, Athens, Greece.', 'Byron-Kessariani Community Mental Health Centre, First Department of Psychiatry, Athens University Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Psychiatriki,Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,101534363,IM,"['Adult', 'Community Mental Health Centers/statistics & numerical data', '*Economic Recession', 'Female', 'Greece/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology/psychology', '*Mental Health/statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', '*Suicide/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Unemployment/*psychology']",,,,,2020/04/14 06:00,2020/09/20 06:00,['2020/04/14 06:00'],"['2020/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.22365/jpsych.2019.304.281 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychiatriki. 2019 Oct-Dec;30(4):281-290. doi: 10.22365/jpsych.2019.304.281.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perspectives from India.,435-441,10.1080/09540261.2020.1839392 [doi],"The mental health gap has been a persistent concern globally, especially in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). In an attempt to mitigate resource limitations, the psychiatric practice has been undergoing a paradigm shift into digitalized mental health interventions. One such innovation involves digital gaming utilizing the principles of 'gamification' to incorporate both the playfulness component of online gaming as well as the domain-targeted design of gaming elements. Digital gaming-based interventions have been to deliver psychotherapy, biofeedback, cognitive training and rehabilitation, as well as behavioural modification and social skills training. Research shows their utility in autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit disorders, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress, eating disorders, neurocognitive disorders and also to promote healthy aging. Though promising in scope, these interventions face pragmatic challenges for implementation in developing countries. Even though increased use of technology, internet penetration and growing digital literacy have enhanced their accessibility and feasibility, various factors like socio-cultural diversity, lack of standardization, poor infrastructural support, bandwidth issues and lack of practice can impair their use and acceptability. Keeping this in the background, this commentary critically discusses the scope, applications and challenges of digital gaming in mental healthcare delivery in one of the rapidly globalizing LMIC nations, India.","['Banerjee, Debanjan', 'Vajawat, Bhavika', 'Varshney, Prateek']","['Banerjee D', 'Vajawat B', 'Varshney P']","['Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India.', 'Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India.', 'Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20201119,England,Int Rev Psychiatry,"International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)",8918131,IM,"['Behavior, Addictive/*psychology/rehabilitation/*therapy', 'Humans', 'India', 'Mental Health/economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Psychotherapy', 'Video Games/*psychology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Digital gaming', 'India', 'gamification', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mental health', 'psychiatry']",2020/11/20 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2020/11/19 08:43'],"['2020/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/19 08:43 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09540261.2020.1839392 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Rev Psychiatry. 2021 Jun;33(4):435-441. doi: 10.1080/09540261.2020.1839392.

Evaluating the lay concept of Mental Ill Health in the United States.,224,10.1186/s12888-023-04680-5 [doi] 224,"PURPOSE: How ""mental disorder"" should be defined has been the focus of extensive theoretical and philosophical debate, but how the concept is understood by laypeople has received much less attention. The study aimed to examine the content (distinctive features and inclusiveness) of these concepts, their degree of correspondence to the DSM-5 definition, and whether alternative concept labels (""mental disorder"", ""mental illness"", ""mental health problem"", ""psychological issue"") have similar or different meanings. METHODS: We investigated concepts of mental disorder in a nationally representative sample of 600 U.S. residents. Subsets of participants made judgments about vignettes describing people with 37 DSM-5 disorders and 24 non-DSM phenomena including neurological conditions, character flaws, bad habits, and culture-specific syndromes. RESULTS: Findings indicated that concepts of mental disorder were primarily based on judgments that a condition is associated with emotional distress and impairment, and that it is rare and aberrant. Disorder judgments were only weakly associated with the DSM-5: many DSM-5 conditions were not judged to be disorders and many non-DSM conditions were so judged.

The prevalence of common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety in the general population of Nigeria is comparatively low. Prevalence data of mental disorders in slum settings in Nigeria is sparse. There is a need to better understand the relationship between protective factors and the occurrence of common mental disorders in the Nigerian slum context. This study aimed to describe the relationship between protective factors and the occurrence of common mental disorders among female urban slum dwellers in Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cross sectional household survey of 550 women was conducted in slum settlements in Ibadan, Nigeria. Interviewer administered questionnaires were completed to elicit information on protective factors (social connectedness, self-esteem, social support, resilience) and common mental disorders (depression, anxiety and stress). The DASS-21 was used to measure common mental disorders and protective factors were measured using the Social Connectedness Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Resilience scale and the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale. A multivariable logistic regression model was employed to examine associations while adjusting for relevant confounders. Common mental disorders were reported by 14.0% of the respondents. Resilience and social support were found to be protective against reporting symptoms of common mental disorders. Women who reported higher levels of social support and resilience were less likely to report common mental disorders (OR:0.96, 95% CI 0.93, 0.98) and (OR:0.95, 95% CI 0.91, 0.99) respectively. Women who were 65 years and older were also less likely to report the occurrence of common mental disorders (OR:0.38, 95% CI 0.15, 0.98) compared to those aged 18-34 years. CONCLUSION: Social support and resilience appear to be protective against common mental disorders among these respondents. Further research should be conducted to explore the pathways through which protective factors reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of common mental disorders. This would be important in the development of mental health interventions.","['Sekoni, Olutoyin', 'Mall, Sumaya', 'Christofides, Nicola']","['Sekoni O', 'Mall S', 'Christofides N']","['Department of Community Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria.', 'School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Guateng, South Africa.', 'School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Guateng, South Africa.', 'School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Guateng, South Africa.']",['eng'],['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20220208,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Anxiety/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depression/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/economics/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria/epidemiology', 'Poverty Areas', 'Prevalence', '*Protective Factors', 'Resilience, Psychological/*physiology', 'Social Support/psychology', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",PMC8824382,,,,2022/02/09 06:00,2022/02/25 06:00,['2022/02/08 17:14'],"['2020/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2022/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/02/08 17:14 [entrez]', '2022/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-20-34838 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0263703 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2022 Feb 8;17(2):e0263703. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0263703. eCollection 2022.,2,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6993-1100'],,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many universities, suicide prevention is an important issue regarding mental health measures, and each university is actively examining this. The current situation concerning measures for suicide prevention in the Japanese National Universities was investigated in 2009. In 2010, the ""college student's suicide prevention measures guideline, 2010"" was established based on the results of this investigation. This guideline refers to the basic philosophy of suicide prevention in Chapter 1, risk factors for suicide in Chapter 2, and systems and activities for suicide prevention in Chapter 3. The Health Service Center, Okayama University plays central roles in mental health and suicide prevention measures on the Medical Campus. The primary prevention includes a mini-lecture on mental health, classes on mental health, and periodic workshops and lectures for freshmen. The secondary prevention includes interviews with students with mental health disorders by a psychiatrist during periodic health check-ups and introducing them to a hospital outside the university. The tertiary prevention includes support for students taking a leave of absence to return to school, periodic consultation with such students with mental disorders, and postvention following a suicide. We believe that for mental health measures on the university campus, it is important to efficiently make use of limited resources, and that these efforts will eventually lead to suicide prevention.","['Ohnishi, Masaru', 'Koyama, Shihomi', 'Senoo, Akiko', 'Kawahara, Hiroko', 'Shimizu, Yukito']","['Ohnishi M', 'Koyama S', 'Senoo A', 'Kawahara H', 'Shimizu Y']",,['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Seishin Shinkeigaku Zasshi,Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica,9801787,IM,"['Humans', '*Mental Health/education', 'Universities', '*Suicide Prevention']",,,,,2016/05/20 06:00,2016/09/02 06:00,['2016/05/20 06:00'],"['2016/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Seishin Shinkeigaku Zasshi. 2016;118(1):22-7.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The growing interest in social risk factors for mental health coincides with the development of social capital research which may further inform the social model of mental health. The objective of the study reported here was to discover if there is an independent association between social capital and mental health when taking into account an array of demographic and violence variables. A total of 1168 youth (15-25 years) in a low income community in Cali, Colombia were surveyed. Mental health was measured by a 20 item self-report questionnaire. The instrument used to measure social capital covered structural and cognitive social capital. Twenty-four per cent of the sample were probable cases of mental ill health. Females had a prevalence rate three times higher than males. Using a model which considered demographic and social capital measures as potential risk factors for mental ill health, the significant risk factors emerged as being female, having limited schooling, working in the informal sector, being a migrant, and having low trust in people. The 'classic' poverty type variables (poor education and employment) were more important than social capital, as was the commonly dominant risk factor for mental ill health-being a woman. When violence factors were added to the model, the 'trust' factor fell out and the most important risk factors became (in descending order of importance): being female; no schooling/incomplete primary; and being a victim of violence. The dominance of poverty related factors, as opposed to social capital, prompts renewed attention to the explanatory mechanisms that link income inequality and poor mental health.","['Harpham, Trudy', 'Grant, Emma', 'Rodriguez, Carlos']","['Harpham T', 'Grant E', 'Rodriguez C']","['Urban Policy and Development, South Bank University, London SW8 2JZ, UK. t.harpham@sbu.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Colombia/epidemiology', 'Community Participation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/classification/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/classification/*statistics & numerical data', 'Poverty Areas', 'Psychosocial Deprivation', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Social Control, Informal', '*Social Support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Trust', 'Violence/statistics & numerical data']",,,,,2004/03/30 05:00,2004/06/30 05:00,['2004/03/30 05:00'],"['2004/03/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0277953603004301 [pii]', '10.1016/j.socscimed.2003.08.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 2004 Jun;58(11):2267-77. doi: 10.1016/j.socscimed.2003.08.013.,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main message delivered to laypeople, however, is that mental disorders are brain diseases cured by scientifically designed medications. Here we describe how this misleading message is generated. We summarize the academic studies describing how biomedical observations are often misrepresented in the scientific literature through various forms of data embellishment, publication biases favoring initial and positive studies, improper interpretations, and exaggerated conclusions. These misrepresentations also affect biological psychiatry and are spread through mass media documents. Exacerbated competition, hyperspecialization, and the need to obtain funding for research projects might drive scientists to misrepresent their findings. Moreover, journalists are unaware that initial studies, even when positive and promising, are inherently uncertain. Journalists preferentially cover them and almost never inform the public when those studies are disconfirmed by subsequent research. This explains why reductionist theories about mental health often persist in mass media even though the scientific claims that have been put forward to support them have long been contradicted. These misrepresentations affect the care of patients. Indeed, studies show that a neuro-essentialist conceptualization of mental disorders negatively affects several aspects of stigmatization, reduces the chances of patients' healing, and overshadows psychotherapeutic and social approaches that have been found effective in alleviating mental suffering. Public information about mental health should avoid these reporting biases and give equal consideration to the biological, psychological, and social aspects of mental health.","['Dumas-Mallet, Estelle', 'Gonon, Francois']","['Dumas-Mallet E', 'Gonon F']","['From the Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases and CNRS UMR, University of Bordeaux.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Harv Rev Psychiatry,Harvard review of psychiatry,9312789,IM,"['Biological Psychiatry/*standards/trends', '*Communications Media', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*standards/trends', 'Publications/*standards', 'Social Stigma', 'Stereotyping']",PMC7647424,,,,2020/11/07 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2020/11/06 12:12'],"['2020/11/06 12:12 [entrez]', '2020/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['00023727-202011000-00004 [pii]', 'HVP50200 [pii]', '10.1097/HRP.0000000000000276 [doi]']",ppublish,Harv Rev Psychiatry. 2020 Nov/Dec;28(6):395-403. doi: 10.1097/HRP.0000000000000276.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While informative for sentencing decisions, information about mental disorders or risk is irrelevant for the question whether the defendant committed the alleged crime. Yet based on cognitive psychological theory of evidence evaluation and integration, we hypothesized that information in an FMHR would affect the evaluation of evidence as well as the ultimate decision about guilt. Using an experimental vignette study among 200 law and criminology students with manipulation of the presence and content of an FMHR, we found a main effect of the presence of an FMHR report on decisions about guilt. The proportion of guilty verdicts increased with almost 20% when an FMHR was present compared to when this report was absent, irrespective of the type of disorder (schizophrenia or personality disorder) or level of recidivism risk (low or high) present in the report. We did not find support for our hypothesis that this effect could be explained by assimilation of other available evidence.

We wished to examine how age transfers its effect to SRH through comorbid disease and mental illness and whether these processes remained stable from 1994 until 2008. The hypothesis is that ageing and/or the increased age-related burden of pathology explains the declining SRH. SETTING: The Tromso Study (TS) is a cohort study using a survey approach with repeated physical examinations. It was conducted in the municipality of Tromso, Norway, from 1974 to 2008. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 21 199 women and 19 229 men participated. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: SRH is the outcome of interest. We calculated and compared the effect sizes of age, comorbidity and mental health symptoms using multimediator analysis based on OLS regression. RESULTS: Ageing had a negative impact on SRH, but the total effect of age decreased from 1994 to 2007. We assessed the direct effect of age and then the proportion of indirect age-related effects through physical illness and mental health symptoms on the total effect. The direct effect of age represented 79.3% of the total effect in 1994 and decreased to 58.8% in 2007. Physical illness emerged as an increasingly important factor and increased its influence from 15.7% to 41.2% of the total effect. Age alone had a protective effect on mental health symptoms and this increased (2.5% to 17.3%), but we found a stronger association between mental health symptoms and physical disease in the later waves of the study (increasing from 3.7% to 14.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the effect on SRH of mental health symptoms caused by physical illness is an increasing public health problem. Treatment and care for specific medical conditions must therefore focus more strongly on how these conditions affect the patient's mental health and address these concerns accordingly.","['Lorem, Geir Fagerjord', 'Schirmer, Henrik', 'Wang, Catharina E A', 'Emaus, Nina']","['Lorem GF', 'Schirmer H', 'Wang CE', 'Emaus N']","['Department of Health and Care Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, The Arctic University of Norway, Tromso, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, The Arctic University of Norway, Tromso, Norway.', 'Division of Cardiothoracic and Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital of Northern Norway, Tromso, Norway.', 'Department of Psychology, Faculty of Health Sciences, The Arctic University of Norway, Tromso, Norway.', 'Division of Child and Adolescent Health, University Hospital of Northern Norway, Tromso, Norway.', 'Department of Health and Care Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, The Arctic University of Norway, Tromso, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170118,England,BMJ Open,BMJ open,101552874,IM,"['Adult', 'Aging/*physiology/psychology', 'Comorbidity', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Middle Aged', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Quality of Life', 'Self Report', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",PMC5253588,,['NOTNLM'],"['EPIDEMIOLOGY', 'MENTAL HEALTH', 'ageing', 'comorbid disease', 'self-reported health']",2017/01/20 06:00,2018/01/02 06:00,['2017/01/20 06:00'],"['2017/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/02 06:00 [medline]']","['bmjopen-2016-013629 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013629 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Open. 2017 Jan 18;7(1):e013629. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013629.,1,,,['Conflicts of Interest: None declared.'],"['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

DESIGN: Preliminary RCT. The primary outcome measure was the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. SETTING: Neurology clinics in a national tertiary paediatric hospital. PATIENTS: Young people attending neurology clinics who met criteria for mental health difficulties according to the Development and Wellbeing Assessment. INTERVENTIONS: 12 weeks of telephone-guided self-help based on a modular approach to psychological therapy for children delivered to children and/or their parents (n=17; eight males; mean age 12.04 years, SD=3.34) or a waiting list for telephone-guided self-help with no additional intervention over 12 weeks (n=17; nine males; mean age 10.53 years, SD=3.14). RESULTS: 124 participants completed the DAWBA, and 34 children and young people were entered into the trial. 65% of those randomised to the intervention arm completed the full intervention, and the intervention was acceptable to those completing it. However, there were significant problems related to lack of data completion (38% data loss for primary outcome measure), choice of control comparator and outcome measures. Due to significant loss of data at follow-up, the effect size findings are considered unreliable. CONCLUSIONS: Further feasibility work should be conducted to improve data completeness before progression to a definitive trial of guided self-help for mental health problems in children with neurological conditions can be recommended.

Gaining a comprehensive understanding of autistic adults' experiences of accessing and receiving mental health support is a critical step to fully inform service provision. We conducted a systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies exploring autistic adults' mental health service experiences, triangulating the perspectives of autistic adults, clinicians and parents. Electronic database searches in MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase were conducted up to October 2021. This identified 10,068 studies, of which 38 met study inclusion criteria. Using a thematic synthesis approach, we generated three superordinate analytical themes ""Lonely, difficult service experience"", ""Complexity needs flexibility"" and ""Collaboration and empowerment"", each with several subthemes. Our findings show that currently, mental health services do not adequately support autistic adults, and can even cause additional harm. There is a need for a more flexible, comprehensive and holistic approach, considering how being autistic affects the individual's mental health presentation and tailoring support to their needs. Building trusting relationships, listening to autistic adults, and empowering them to take agency, appear to be fundamental steps towards more successful mental health care provision.","['Brede, Janina', 'Cage, Eilidh', 'Trott, Joseph', 'Palmer, Lisa', 'Smith, Anika', 'Serpell, Lucy', 'Mandy, Will', 'Russell, Ailsa']","['Brede J', 'Cage E', 'Trott J', 'Palmer L', 'Smith A', 'Serpell L', 'Mandy W', 'Russell A']","['Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, 1-19 Torrington Place, London WC1E 6BT, UK.

The climate is a complex system and scientists are striving to predict, prevent, and address the aforementioned issues in order to avoid reaching tipping points. The threat to humankind is not only physical (ie, heat waves, floods, droughts) but also psychological, especially for some groups. Insecurity, danger, chaos, and an unstable system due to climate change have both short- and long-term psychological effects. In this scenario, the need for new psychological categories is emerging, namely, eco-emotions and psychoterratic syndromes which include eco-anxiety, ecological grief, climate worry, and climate trauma. This paper focuses on these new categories, presenting a summary of each one, including definitions, hypotheses, questions, and testological evaluations, as a useful tool to be consulted by researchers and clinicians and to help them in the therapeutic work. Also, this paper endeavors to distinguish between a psychological stress resulting in a positive outcome, such as pro-environmental behavior, compared to a stress that leads to a psychopathology. Prevention and intervention strategies including social and community support are fundamental to help cope with and mitigate the effect of climate change on mental health. In conclusion, the climate crisis has led to an enormous increase in research on climate change and its consequences on mental health. Researchers and clinicians must be prepared to assess this complex phenomenon and provide help to those who cannot cope with anxiety and climatic mourning.","['Cianconi, Paolo', 'Hanife, Batul', 'Grillo, Francesco', ""Betro', Sophia"", 'Lesmana, Cokorda Bagus Jaya', 'Janiri, Luigi']","['Cianconi P', 'Hanife B', 'Grillo F', ""Betro' S"", 'Lesmana CBJ', 'Janiri L']","['Department of Neurosciences, Section of Psychiatry, Catholic University, Rome, Italy.', 'Provincial Agency for Health Services, Institute of the Autonomous Province of Trento, Mezzolombardo, Italy.', 'Department of History, Anthropology, Religions, Art History, Media and Performing Arts, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Psychopathology, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Udayana University, Bali, Indonesia.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Section of Psychiatry, Catholic University, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20230630,United States,Yale J Biol Med,The Yale journal of biology and medicine,0417414,IM,"['Humans', '*Climate Change', '*Mental Health', 'Syndrome', 'Emotions']",PMC10303262,,['NOTNLM'],"['biodiversity loss', 'climate change', 'climate trauma', 'eco-anxiety', 'eco-emotion', 'ecological grief', 'mental health', 'pro-environmental behavior', 'psychoterratic syndrome', 'tipping point']",2023/07/03 13:06,2023/07/05 06:42,['2023/07/03 11:28'],"['2023/07/05 06:42 [medline]', '2023/07/03 13:06 [pubmed]', '2023/07/03 11:28 [entrez]']","['yjbm962211 [pii]', '10.59249/EARX2427 [doi]']",epublish,Yale J Biol Med. 2023 Jun 30;96(2):211-226. doi: 10.59249/EARX2427. eCollection 2023 Jun.,2,,,,"['Copyright (c)2023, Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chatbots are systems that are able to converse and interact with human users using spoken, written, and visual language. While numerous studies have assessed the effectiveness and safety of using chatbots in mental health, no reviews have pooled the results of those studies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of using chatbots to improve mental health through summarizing and pooling the results of previous studies. METHODS: A systematic review was carried out to achieve this objective. The search sources were 7 bibliographic databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO), the search engine ""Google Scholar,"" and backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted data from the included studies, and assessed the risk of bias. Data extracted from studies were synthesized using narrative and statistical methods, as appropriate. RESULTS: Of 1048 citations retrieved, we identified 12 studies examining the effect of using chatbots on 8 outcomes. Weak evidence demonstrated that chatbots were effective in improving depression, distress, stress, and acrophobia. In contrast, according to similar evidence, there was no statistically significant effect of using chatbots on subjective psychological wellbeing. Results were conflicting regarding the effect of chatbots on the severity of anxiety and positive and negative affect. Only two studies assessed the safety of chatbots and concluded that they are safe in mental health, as no adverse events or harms were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Chatbots have the potential to improve mental health. However, the evidence in this review was not sufficient to definitely conclude this due to lack of evidence that their effect is clinically important, a lack of studies assessing each outcome, high risk of bias in those studies, and conflicting results for some outcomes. Further studies are required to draw solid conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of chatbots.

However, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials investigating this area. Due to the massive costs in health care systems, there is a need for new strategies to address these issues and an urgent need for attention to this field. Nature-based interventions are low cost, easy to implement, and should get attention within the health care field. Therefore, the objective was to find the impact of nature interventions on mental well-being in humans with a physical disease. METHODS: In four major databases (PubMed, Cinahl, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library), a systematic review of quantitative studies of nature's impact on self-reported mental health in patients with physical disease was performed. A total of 1909 articles were retrieved but only five met the inclusion criteria and were summarized. RESULTS: All five studies were quantitative, with a control group and a nature-based intervention. A source of heterogeneity was identified: the patients in one of the five studies were psychosomatic. In the four studies with somatic patients, significant benefit of nature on self-reported mental health outcomes was found; the only study that failed to show a significant benefit was the one with psychosomatic patients. CONCLUSION: A significant effect of nature on mental well-being of patients with somatic disease was found. The result in patients with psychosomatic disease is inconclusive, and more studies in this category are needed. Further research on the effect of nature on mental health is merited, with special attention to standardizing intervention type and dose as well as outcome measures within each medical discipline.","['Trostrup, C H', 'Christiansen, A B', 'Stolen, K S', 'Nielsen, P K', 'Stelter, R']","['Trostrup CH', 'Christiansen AB', 'Stolen KS', 'Nielsen PK', 'Stelter R']","['Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Norre Alle 51, Kbh N, Copenhagen, Denmark. ct3@kp.dk.', 'Department of Management, Organisation and Administration.

Mounting evidence has confirmed the plausibility of high incidences of mental disorders in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. However, the association between the neighborhood built environment and individual mental health is understudied and far from conclusive, especially in developing countries such as China. The underlying mechanism requires in-depth analysis combining potential intermediates such as perceived environmental disorder and supportive social relationships. Using a health survey conducted in Beijing in 2017, this study investigates for the first time a socio-environmental pathway through which perceived disorder and social interaction account for the relationship between the built environment and mental health under the very notion of the neighborhood effect. The results from multilevel structural equation models indicate that individual mental health is influenced by the neighborhood-scale built environment through three pathways, independent of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantages: (1) proximity to parks is the sole indicator directly linked to mental health; (2) population density, road connectivity and proximity to parks are indirectly associated with mental health through interactions with neighbors; and (3) population density, road connectivity and facility diversity are partially associated with perceived neighborhood disorder, which is indirectly correlated with mental health through interactions with neighbors. This study is a preliminary attempt to disentangle the complex relationships among the neighborhood environment, social interaction and mental health in the context of developing megacities. The relevant findings provide an important reference for urban planners and administrators regarding how to build health-supportive neighborhoods and healthy cities.","['Tao, Yinhua', 'Yang, Jie', 'Chai, Yanwei']","['Tao Y', 'Yang J', 'Chai Y']","['College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China.', 'College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China.', 'College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191218,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,IM,"['Adult', 'Beijing', 'Built Environment/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*psychology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Multilevel Analysis', 'Residence Characteristics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",PMC6981470,,['NOTNLM'],"['Beijing', 'built environment', 'mental health', 'neighborhood disorder', 'social interaction']",2019/12/22 06:00,2020/04/17 06:00,['2019/12/22 06:00'],"['2019/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph17010013 [pii]', 'ijerph-17-00013 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph17010013 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2019 Dec 18;17(1):13. doi: 10.3390/ijerph17010013.,1,,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to assess socioeconomic inequality in poor mental health among Iranian adults. METHODS: The study used the baseline data of PERSIAN cohort study including 131,813 participants from 17 geographically distinct areas of Iran. The Erreygers Concentration index (E) was used to quantify the socioeconomic inequalities in poor mental health. Moreover, we decomposed the E to identify factors contributing to the observed socioeconomic inequality in poor mental health in Iran. RESULTS: The estimated E for poor mental health was - 0.012 (95% CI: - 0.0144, - 0.0089), indicating slightly higher concentration of mental health problem among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults in Iran. Socioeconomic inequality in poor mental health was mainly explained by gender (19.93%) and age (12.70%). Region, SES itself, and physical activity were other important factors that contributed to the concentration of poor mental health among adults with low socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: There exists nearly equitable distribution in poor mental health among Iranian adults, but with important variations by gender, SES, and geography. These results suggested that interventional programs in Iran should focus on should focus more on socioeconomically disadvantaged people as a whole, with particular attention to the needs of women and those living in more socially disadvantaged regions.","['Najafi, Farid', 'Pasdar, Yahya', 'Karami Matin, Behzad', 'Rezaei, Satar', 'Kazemi Karyani, Ali', 'Soltani, Shahin', 'Soofi, Moslem', 'Rezaeian,

Asylum seekers are vulnerable in terms of mental health but they receive very little specific psychiatric care. The purpose of this literature review is to examine current situation regarding asylum seekers' psychiatric healthcare. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This research was conducted using a keyword search on Medline, PubMed and Google Scholar. RESULTS: The literature on the management of the mental health of asylum seekers focuses on the issue of post-traumatic stress disorder. There is little data on other forms of mental illness in this population. The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder among asylum seekers is higher than in the general population and its clinical expression is varied and often complex because it involves various vulnerability factors. Guidelines for post-traumatic stress disorder recommend cognitive behavioral therapy with, in some cases, the use of pharmacotherapy. Given the specificities of the asylum seekers' population, in many cases it is not possible to set up such therapy immediately. Asylum seekers face a number of challenges in accessing mental healthcare. CONCLUSION: Management of the mental health of asylum seekers requires special attention and guidelines for the general population are not directly applicable to this specific population. The literature focuses on the issue of post-traumatic stress disorder. This review was not able to analyse the state of existing care offer in Belgium for managing the mental health of asylum seekers and the care pathways they take.","['Derlet, Ophelie', 'Deschietere, Gerald']","['Derlet O', 'Deschietere G']","['Universite Catholique de Louvain, Department of Adult Psychiatry, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc Avenue Hippocrate 10, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium, ophelie.derlet@student.uclouvain.be.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Croatia,Psychiatr Danub,Psychiatria Danubina,9424753,IM,"['Belgium', 'Humans', '*Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', '*Psychiatry/organization & administration/statistics & numerical data', 'Refugees/*psychology', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*psychology/*therapy']",,,,,2019/09/07 06:00,2019/10/24 06:00,['2019/09/07 06:00'],"['2019/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Psychiatr Danub. 2019 Sep;31(Suppl 3):395-399.,Suppl 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also invites consideration of the ways and means of integrating preventive measures that emphasize the conservation of mental health with prophylactic efforts that stress the avoidance of mental illnesses.A REVIEW OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH LOCAL AND STATEWIDE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA REVEALS THAT THREE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACHES HAVE BEEN USED: (1) The traditional approach which confines itself to the protection of society from the ""insane"" by the state, and to the treatment of those who are not legally insane through ""private enterprise""; (2) the public health approach which seeks to minimize the causes and/or spread of selected types of psychiatric disorder regarded as mass phenomena; and (3) the sociological approach which stresses the importance of social factors both in the causation and in the rehabilitation of those mental conditions that are considered to be symptomatic of a ""sick"" society. An approach that combines the theoretical and practical implications of all three viewpoints offers some new solutions to the problems of (1) fitting mental health programs to populations; (2) financing; and (3) balancing preventive and clinical services. Mental illness is not a single disease-entity but a long list of distinctly different conditions. The causes and manifestations are multiple. Biological, psychological and social components in either mental health or mental illness cannot be dissociated in any attempt to understand and deal with so wide a range of illnesses and states of comparative health.

It places a strong emphasis on the salience of indicated prevention, early intervention, and secondary prevention of major mental disorders. By contrast to established models for major mood and psychotic syndromes that emerge after puberty, developments in clinical staging for childhood-onset disorders lags significantly behind. In this article, criteria for a transdiagnostic staging model for those internalizing and externalizing disorders that emerge in childhood is presented. This sits alongside three putative pathophysiological profiles (developmental, circadian, and anxious-arousal) that may underpin these common illness trajectories. Given available evidence, we argue that it is now timely to develop a transdiagnostic staging model for childhood-onset syndromes. It is further argued that a transdiagnostic staging model has the potential to capture more precisely the dimensional, fluctuating developmental patterns of illness progression of childhood psychopathology. Given potential improvements in modelling etiological processes, and delivering more personalized interventions, transdiagnostic clinical staging for childhood holds much promise for assisting to improve outcomes. We finish by presenting an agenda for research in developments of transdiagnostic clinical staging for childhood mental health.","['Sawrikar, Vilas', 'Macbeth, Angus', 'Gillespie-Smith, Karri', 'Brown, Megan', 'Lopez-Williams, Andy', 'Boulton, Kelsie', 'Guestella, Adam', 'Hickie, Ian']","['Sawrikar V', 'Macbeth A', 'Gillespie-Smith K', 'Brown M', 'Lopez-Williams A', 'Boulton K', 'Guestella A', 'Hickie I']","['Centre of Applied Developmental Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK. vilas.sawrikar@ed.ac.uk.', 'Department of Clinical & Health Psychology, School of Health in Social Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Medical School (Doorway 6), Room 1M.8, Teviot Place, Edinburgh, EH8 9AG, UK. vilas.sawrikar@ed.ac.uk.', 'Centre of Applied Developmental Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.', 'Department of Clinical & Health Psychology, School of Health in Social Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Medical School (Doorway 6), Room 1M.8, Teviot Place, Edinburgh, EH8 9AG, UK.', 'Centre of Applied Developmental Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.', 'Department of Clinical & Health Psychology, School of Health in Social Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Medical School (Doorway 6), Room 1M.8, Teviot Place, Edinburgh, EH8 9AG, UK.', 'ADHD & Autism Psychological Services and Advocacy, Utica, NY, USA.', 'ADHD & Autism Psychological Services and Advocacy, Utica, NY, USA.', 'Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20220522,United States,Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev,Clinical child and family psychology review,9807947,IM,"['Anxiety', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Mental Disorders/psychology', '*Mental Health', 'Psychopathology', 'Syndrome']",PMC9427921,,['NOTNLM'],"['Developmental psychopathology', 'Dimensional classification', 'Externalising problems', 'Internalising problems', 'Transdiagnostic mental health']",2022/05/23 06:00,2022/09/03 06:00,['2022/05/22 13:58'],"['2022/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/09/03 06:00 [medline]', '2022/05/22 13:58 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10567-022-00399-z [pii]', '399 [pii]', '10.1007/s10567-022-00399-z [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev. 2022 Sep;25(3):613-626. doi: 10.1007/s10567-022-00399-z.

We evaluated whether psychiatric disorders would emerge during asymptomatic periods in a naturalistic, uncontrolled clinical cohort. Patients with primary KLS underwent psychiatric interviews at diagnosis and every year for 1-10 years, leading to diagnosis of former and present comorbid psychiatric disorders. Among the 115 patients (65.2% male and aged 16.1 +/- 4.8 years at KLS onset), 19 (16.5%) had a history of psychiatric disorder prior to KLS onset, which persisted afterwards in 10. Twenty-five (21%) patients developed a new, comorbid psychiatric disorder 1-6 years after KLS onset, during 'asymptomatic' periods, including mood disorders (n = 14; including major depressive episodes, n = 8; recurrent depressive episodes, n = 2; bipolar I disorder, n = 1; dysthymic disorder, n = 1; adjustment disorder with depressive mood, n = 1; and mood disorder not otherwise specified, n = 1), anxiety disorders (n = 7), eating disorders (n = 2), psychotic disorders not otherwise specified (n = 2), schizoaffective disorder (n = 1) and cannabis dependence (n = 1). Six patients attempted suicide: two before and two after KLS onset, and two during episodes. Female sex, longer disease course, longer time incapacitated (356 +/- 223 versus 155 +/- 186 days) and more frequent psychiatric symptoms during episodes (but no family or personal history of psychiatric disorders) were associated with emerging psychiatric disorders. Contrary to the alleged benignity of KLS and normality between episodes, one KLS patient in five suffers from emerging psychiatric disorders. These disorders may depend on personal vulnerability and, most probably, on psychiatric symptoms during episodes.","['Groos, Elisabeth', 'Chaumereuil, Charlotte', 'Flamand, Mathilde', 'Brion, Agnes', 'Bourdin, Hubert', 'Slimani, Vanessa', 'Lecendreux, Michel', 'Arnulf, Isabelle']","['Groos E', 'Chaumereuil C', 'Flamand M', 'Brion A', 'Bourdin H', 'Slimani V', 'Lecendreux M', 'Arnulf I']","['National Reference Centre for Narcolepsy, Hypersomnia and Kleine-Levin Syndrome, Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Sleep Disorder Unit, Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'National Reference Centre for Narcolepsy, Hypersomnia and Kleine-Levin Syndrome, Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Sleep Disorder Unit, Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Sleep Disorder Unit, Salengro University Hospital, Lille, France.', 'National Reference Centre for Narcolepsy, Hypersomnia and Kleine-Levin Syndrome, Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Sleep Disorder Unit, Psychiatry Department, Besancon University Hospital, Besancon, France.', 'National Reference Centre for Narcolepsy, Hypersomnia and Kleine-Levin Syndrome, Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Sleep Disorder Unit, Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'National Reference Centre for Narcolepsy, Hypersomnia and Kleine-Levin Syndrome, Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Robert Debre Child University Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'National Reference Centre for Narcolepsy, Hypersomnia and Kleine-Levin Syndrome, Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Sleep Disorder Unit, Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne University, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180414,England,J Sleep Res,Journal of sleep research,9214441,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kleine-Levin Syndrome/*psychology', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*trends']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Kleine-Levin syndrome', 'Neuropsychiatry', 'anxiety', 'depression']",2018/04/15 06:00,2019/10/16 06:00,['2018/04/15 06:00'],"['2018/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jsr.12690 [doi]'],ppublish,J Sleep Res. 2018 Oct;27(5):e12690. doi: 10.1111/jsr.12690.

The approach has implications for support functions in a number of areas including policy building, manpower and material development and research. Priority action areas for mental health as part of NAP-NCD include the integration of surveillance of mental illnesses in a comprehensive population-based NCD surveillance system; creating awareness about mental health as part of an integrated NCD behavioural change communication strategy; integration of mental health with primary healthcare; the development of sustainable public health infrastructure to support community mental health initiatives; building capacity of the health system in support of prevention and control activities; effective implementation of existing legislation and harmonizing working relationships with law enforcing agencies. NAP-NCD also stresses on the need to integrate mental health into health services as part of a sustainable and integrated medical education programme for all categories of healthcare providers and the availability of essential psychotropic drugs at all healthcare levels. It lays emphasis on protecting the interests of special groups such as prisoners, refugees and displaced persons, women, children and individuals with disabilities.

The present study aims to describe the mental health and quality of life of these individuals. METHODS: Data, based on 510 individuals, were obtained by means of a questionnaire at open screenings conducted at or nearby refugee housing facilities. Of the participating refugees, 367 were asylum seekers and 143 had received a residence permit but were still awaiting a more permanent housing solution. The questionnaire included measures of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), symptoms of anxiety (GAD-7), risk of having post-traumatic stress disorder (PC-PTSD), and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF). RESULTS: Of the total sample, 56-58.4% reported clinically significant levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety and risk of having PTSD. Prevalence estimates were higher among asylum seekers than among those who had received their residence permit. Quality of life was generally rated below population norms and correlated negatively with mental health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals residing in refugee housing facilities show high levels of psychological distress and rate their quality of life as low. Asylum seekers score higher than those having received a residence permit. These results are troublesome since the wait time for asylum decisions has lengthened considerably after 2015. The results of the present study calls for the urgency of societal actions to shorten the asylum process and improve conditions at the housing facilities.","['Leiler, Anna', 'Bjarta, Anna', 'Ekdahl, Johanna', 'Wasteson, Elisabet']","['Leiler A', 'Bjarta A', 'Ekdahl J', 'Wasteson E']","['Department of Psychology, Mid Sweden University, 831 25, Ostersund, Sweden. anna.leiler@miun.se.', 'Department of Psychology, Mid Sweden University, 831 25, Ostersund, Sweden.', 'Department of Psychology, Mid Sweden University, 831 25, Ostersund, Sweden.', 'Department of Psychology, Mid Sweden University, 831 25, Ostersund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['I2119/The Asylum-, Migration-, and Integration Fund - European Commission/']",['Journal Article'],20181222,Germany,Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,8804358,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Depression/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Female', 'Housing/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Mental Health/ethnology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Refugees/*psychology', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Asylum seekers', 'Mental health', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of life', 'Refugee']",2018/12/24 06:00,2019/08/06 06:00,['2018/12/24 06:00'],"['2018/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00127-018-1651-6 [pii]', '10.1007/s00127-018-1651-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol. 2019 May;54(5):543-551. doi: 10.1007/s00127-018-1651-6.

AIM: To present the prevalences of lifetime and 12-month DSM-IV mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders and impulse-control disorders reported in NEMESIS-2 (Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study), and to compare the 12-month prevalence of mood disorders, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders with estimates from the first study (NEMESIS-1). METHOD: Between November 2007 and July 2009, face-to-face interviews were conducted among 6646 subjects aged 18-64 by means of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. Trends in mental disorders were examined with these data and NEMESIS-1 data from 1996 (n = 7076). RESULTS: The lifetime prevalence in NEMESIS-2 was 20.2% for mood disorder, 19.6% for anxiety disorder, 19.1% for substance use disorder and 9.2% for impulse-control or behaviour disorder. For the 12-month disorders, the prevalences were 6.1%, 10.1%, 5.6% and 2.1%, respectively. Between 1996 and 2007-2009, there was no change in the 12-month prevalence of anxiety disorder and substance use disorder. The 12-month prevalence of mood disorder decreased slightly but was no longer significant after differences in the sociodemographic variables between the two studies had been taken into account. CONCLUSION: This study shows that in the Netherlands mental disorders occur fairly frequently. Over about a decade, no clear change was found in the mental health status of the population.","['de Graaf, R', 'Ten Have, M', 'van Gool, C', 'van Dorsselaer, S']","['de Graaf R', 'Ten Have M', 'van Gool C', 'van Dorsselaer S']","['Trimbos-instituut, Utrecht. rgraaf@trimbos.nl']",['dut'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Netherlands,Tijdschr Psychiatr,Tijdschrift voor psychiatrie,0423731,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Interview, Psychological/*methods', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*trends', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2012/01/13 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['TVPart_9311 [pii]'],ppublish,Tijdschr Psychiatr. 2012;54(1):27-38.,1,,,,,Prevalentie van psychische aandoeningen en trends van 1996 tot 2009; resultaten van NEMESIS-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the high prevalence and cost of mental health disorders, an estimated 75 % of those with need in lower resource settings do not receive intervention. Most studies to date have examined the effectiveness of single-disorder mental health treatments - an approach that may be a significant challenge to scale-up and sustainability in lower resource settings. MAIN BODY: This paper presents a brief overview of the scientific progress in global mental health, and suggests consideration of an internal stepped care delivery approach. An internal stepped care model is one idea of a delivery system, utilizing a common elements approach, where the same provider could navigate between different elements based on severity and type of problems of the client. It is distinct from traditional stepped care models in that clients remain with the same provider, rather than relying on referral systems. CONCLUSION: An internal stepped care delivery system based on a simplified common elements approach could be more efficient, scalable, sustainable, and reduce the loss of clients to referrals in lower resource settings.","['Murray, L K', 'Jordans, M J D']","['Murray LK', 'Jordans MJ']","['Department of Mental Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 624 N.

In the current article we used the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 to examine burden due to mental and substance use disorders in Romania. METHODS: For each mental and substance use disorder included in the GBD 2016 we reported the yearly estimates for YLL (as a measure for non-fatal burden), YLD (fatal burden) and DALY (summing years lived with disability and years of life lost to give a measure of total burden). RESULTS: Mental and substance use disorders were the third leading cause of non-fatal burden in Romania in 2016, explaining 13.53% of total years lived with disability, the ninth leading cause for fatal burden explaining 0.84% of total years of life lost, and were the fifth leading cause of total burden, accounting for 5.52% of total disability-adjusted life years. Among MSDs, depression, anxiety and alcohol use disorders have the highest rate. Starting 1997 there has been a slow decrease of age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rates, with no significant change in the last 5 years. CONCLUSION: Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 found that mental and substance use disorders were the fifth leading contributors to disease burden in Romania, with anxiety and depressive being the most prevalent. Despite national programs and strategies in the area of mental health initiated especially after 1990, the mental health system does not fully meet the needs of the patients. Effective population-level strategic measures are still required in order to reduce the burden of disease.","['Iovu, Mihai-Bogdan', 'Breaz, Maria Alina']","['Iovu MB', 'Breaz MA']","['Social Work Department, Babes-Bolyai University, 128, 21 decembrie 1989 Blvd., 400604 Cluj-Napoca, Romania, iovu.mihai@ubbcluj.ro.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Croatia,Psychiatr Danub,Psychiatria Danubina,9424753,IM,"['Disabled Persons', 'Global Burden of Disease/*statistics & numerical data', 'Global Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', 'Romania/epidemiology', 'Substance-Related Disorders/*epidemiology']",,,,,2019/11/08 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.24869/psyd.2019.457 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychiatr Danub. 2019 Dec;31(4):457-464. doi: 10.24869/psyd.2019.457.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of this paper are to determine whether a sample of university students recognise different symptoms of depression and schizophrenia and to reveal factors influencing correct recognition. METHODS: Bivariate and correspondence analyses of the results from an online survey among university students (n = 225). RESULTS: Most participants recognised the specific symptoms of depression. The symptoms of schizophrenia were acknowledged to a lower extent. Delusions of control and hallucinations of taste were not identified as symptoms of schizophrenia. Repeated revival of a trauma for depression and split personality for schizophrenia were frequently mistaken as symptoms of the respective disorders. Bivariate analyses demonstrated that previous interest in and a side job related to mental disorders, as well as previous personal treatment experience had a positive influence on symptom recognition. The correspondence analysis showed that male students of natural science, economics and philosophy are illiterate in recognising the symptoms depression and schizophrenia. CONCLUSION: Among the educational elite, a wide variability in mental health literacy was found. Therefore, it's important for public mental health interventions to focus on the different recognition rates in depression and schizophrenia. Possibilities for contact must be arranged according to interest and activity (e.g., at work). In order to improve mental health literacy, finally, education and/or internship should be integrated in high school or apprenticeship curricula. Special emphasis must be given towards the effects of gender and stereotypes held about mental illnesses.","['Lauber, Christoph', 'Ajdacic-Gross, Vladeta', 'Fritschi, Nadja', 'Stulz, Niklaus', 'Rossler, Wulf']","['Lauber C', 'Ajdacic-Gross V', 'Fritschi N', 'Stulz N', 'Rossler W']","['Psychiatric University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland. christoph.lauber@puk.zh.ch']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20050509,England,BMC Public Health,BMC public health,100968562,IM,"['Adult', 'Depressive Disorder/*diagnosis/physiopathology', '*Educational Status', 'Female', 'Health Education', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Knowledge', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*classification', 'Schizophrenia/*diagnosis/physiopathology', '*Social Perception', '*Students', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Switzerland', '*Universities']",PMC1156910,,,,2005/05/11 09:00,2006/01/25 09:00,['2005/05/11 09:00'],"['2004/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2458-5-44 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2458-5-44 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Public Health. 2005 May 9;5:44. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-5-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of those descriptions across ages allows for the conclusion that character and type of stressors has changed, however, people's reactions to highly intensive stressors are basically similar. First descriptions are found in notes of Egyptian physicians and then in papers of Homer, Herodotus and Plutarch. In consecutive parts of this paper, the authors present history of posttraumatic stress disorder describing contribution of Polish authors - Kepinski and Szymusik.

However, to date, there has been little evidence-informed guidance as to what workplaces should be doing to enhance their employees' mental health and wellbeing. In this article, we present a framework outlining the key strategies employers can implement to create more mentally healthy workplaces. The five key strategies outlined are as follows: (1) designing work to minimise harm, (2) building organisational resilience through good management, (3) enhancing personal resilience, (4) promoting early help-seeking and (5) supporting recovery and return to work. A narrative review is utilised to outline the theoretical evidence for this framework and to describe the available research evidence for a number of key example interventions for each of the five strategies. While each workplace needs to develop tailored solutions, the five strategy framework proposed in this review will hopefully provide a simple framework for employers and those advising them to use when judging the adequacy of existing services and considering opportunities for further enhancements.","['Petrie, Katherine', 'Joyce, Sadhbh', 'Tan, Leona', 'Henderson, Max', 'Johnson, Anya', 'Nguyen, Helena', 'Modini, Matthew', 'Groth, Markus', 'Glozier, Nicholas', 'Harvey, Samuel B']","['Petrie K', 'Joyce S', 'Tan L', 'Henderson M', 'Johnson A', 'Nguyen H', 'Modini M', 'Groth M', 'Glozier N', 'Harvey SB']","['1 School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', '1 School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', '1 School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', '2 School of Psychology, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', '3 Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Leeds, UK.', '4 The University of Sydney Business School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', '4 The University of Sydney Business School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', '1 School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', '2 School of Psychology, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', '5 UNSW Business School, UNSW Sydney, NSW, Australia.', '6 Brain and Mind Centre, Central Clinical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', '1 School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', '7 Black Dog Institute, Randwick, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170823,England,Aust N Z J Psychiatry,The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,0111052,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Occupational Health/*standards', 'Psychotherapy/*standards', 'Workplace/*standards']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mental health', 'intervention', 'mental disorder', 'mental illness', 'workplace']",2017/08/25 06:00,2019/06/07 06:00,['2017/08/25 06:00'],"['2017/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0004867417726174 [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Psychiatry. 2018 Jan;52(1):15-23. doi: 10.1177/0004867417726174.

Participants had highly stigmatized attitudes towards patients from a forensic hospital and those with active substance use disorders. Attitudes were less stigmatized to people with substance use disorders who were recovering in remission. This suggested that health professionals have stigmatized attitudes towards an illness such as schizophrenia and this is worse towards patients from a secure hospital.

Patients are asked to hyperventilate and questioned as to whether they experience the symptoms of which they have complained. Successful treatment involves reassurance, education, and giving the patient a strategy for controlling the hyperventilation. If treatment is not successful in a short period, patients should be referred to a qualified mental health professional.

The questionnaire included sociodemographics, self-reported physical symptoms, underground adverse environmental factors, and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Five environmental parameters of 1 deep mine were also measured.Data from 266 valid questionnaires were analyzed. The 3 most frequent complaints about underground adverse conditions were moisture [62.03% (165/266)], dim light [45.86% (122/266)], and high temperature [42.11% (112/266)]. Fatigue [40.22% (107/266)], hearing loss [34.96% (93/266)], and tinnitus [31.58% (84/266)] were reported to be the three most common physical symptoms. Insomnia was reported in 204 participants (76.69%) mainly due to the difficulty of falling asleep [42.35% (84/204)] and dreams [39.70% (81/204)]. Mean scores of SCL-90-R subscales including somatization, anxiety, phobic anxiety, psychoticism, and paranoid ideation were elevated compared to Chinese norms, while there was diminished interpersonal sensitivity. Univariate analyses indicated that the 3 most common physical symptoms were associated with poorer SCL-90-R scores. With increasing depth below ground, air pressure, relative humidity, CO2 concentration and temperature rose, while total gamma radiation dose-rate decreased.The physical and mental health status of deep underground miners was poorer than the general Chinese male population. Some adverse environmental factors were identified that may have influenced health status.

Social networks allow individuals with mental disorders to communicate with others sufferers via online communities, providing an invaluable resource for studies on textual signs of psychological health problems. Mental disorders often occur in combinations, e.g., a patient with an anxiety disorder may also develop depression. This co-occurring mental health condition provides the focus for our work on classifying online communities with an interest in depression. For this, we have crawled a large body of 620 000 posts made by 80 000 users in 247 online communities. We have extracted the topics and psycholinguistic features expressed in the posts, using these as inputs to our model. Following a machine learning technique, we have formulated a joint modeling framework in order to classify mental health-related co-occurring online communities from these features. Finally, we performed empirical validation of the model on the crawled dataset where our model outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines.","['Saha, Budhaditya', 'Nguyen, Thin', 'Phung, Dinh', 'Venkatesh, Svetha']","['Saha B', 'Nguyen T', 'Phung D', 'Venkatesh S']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160318,United States,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,101604520,IM,"['Blogging', '*Depression', 'Health Information Management/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*classification', '*Models, Statistical', 'Social Media/*classification']",,,,,2016/03/24 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/03/24 06:00'],"['2016/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1109/JBHI.2016.2543741 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform. 2016 Jul;20(4):1008-15. doi: 10.1109/JBHI.2016.2543741.

METHOD: A content analysis was carried out on a year's worth of published articles and a year's worth of competitive research grants. Abstracts of articles and grants were coded for a number of attributes, including the type of mental disorder covered. The percentage of articles and grant funding for various mental disorders was compared against published data on the disease burden and health system costs attributable to these disorders. RESULTS: Mental disorders contribute 19.1% of disease burden and 9.8% of health system costs, but receive only 8.9% of National Health and Medical Research Council funding. An examination of the distribution of research within the mental health area showed that substance use disorders are by far the most researched in terms of both publications and grant funding, followed by affective disorders. By contrast, affective disorders account for the most burden, followed by dementia, substance use and anxiety disorders. The biggest consumers of health system costs are dementia, affective disorders, and schizophrenia and other psychoses. CONCLUSIONS: While all mental disorders merit more research attention than they are currently receiving, affective disorders and dementia appear to be particularly under-researched given their contribution to disease burden and health system costs.","['Jorm, Anthony F', 'Griffiths, Kathleen M', 'Christensen, Helen', 'Medway, Jo']","['Jorm AF', 'Griffiths KM', 'Christensen H', 'Medway J']","['Centre for Mental Health Research, Australian National University, Australia.

In Study 1, core scenes from 89 late-mid-life adults' life stories were assessed for several narrative themes. Participants' mental health and physical health were assessed concurrently with the narratives and annually for the subsequent 4 years. Concurrent analyses indicated that the themes of agency, redemption, and contamination were significantly associated with mental health. Longitudinal analyses indicated that these same 3 themes were significantly associated with participants' trajectories of mental health over the course of 4 years. Exploratory analyses indicated that narratives of challenging experiences may be central to this pattern of results. In Study 2, similar longitudinal analyses were conducted on a sample of 27 late-mid-life adults who received a major physical illness diagnosis between the baseline assessment and 6 months later and a matched sample of 27 control participants who remained healthy throughout the study. Participants' mental health and physical health were assessed every 6 months for 2 years. In this study, the themes of agency, communion, redemption, and contamination in participants' life narratives collected at baseline (before any participant became sick) were significantly associated with mental health in the group of participants who went on to receive a medical diagnosis, but not in the control group. Taken together, the results of these 2 studies indicate that the way an individual constructs personal narratives may impact his or her trajectory of mental health over time.","['Adler, Jonathan M', 'Turner, Ariana F', 'Brookshier, Kathryn M', 'Monahan, Casey', 'Walder-Biesanz, Ilana', 'Harmeling, Luke H', 'Albaugh, Michelle', 'McAdams, Dan P', 'Oltmanns, Thomas F']","['Adler JM', 'Turner AF', 'Brookshier KM', 'Monahan C', 'Walder-Biesanz I', 'Harmeling LH', 'Albaugh M', 'McAdams DP', 'Oltmanns TF']","['Franklin W.

The answer could be complex: evidence from the 2008 crisis in Spain.,78,10.1186/s12874-018-0538-2 [doi] 78,"BACKGROUND: We explored the impact of 2008 recession on the prevalence of mental health problems in Spain. METHODS: Repeated cross-sectional survey design. Datasets from 2006 and 2011 were used, and temporal change was examined. The study was conducted on the economically active population (16-64 years old). The two surveys included 29,478 and 21,007 people, obtaining a 96 and 89.6% response rate, respectively. Multiple logistic regression models were adjusted to identify poor mental health risk factors. A standardisation analysis was performed to estimate the prevalence of people at risk of poor mental health (GHQ+). RESULTS: The prevalence of GHQ+ following the crisis increased in men and decreased in women. Two logistic regression analyses identified GHQ+ risk factors. From 2006 to 2011, unemployment rose and income fell for both men and women, and there was a decline in the prevalence of somatic illness and limitations, factors associated with a higher prevalence of GHQ+. After controlling for age, the change in employment and income among men prompted an increase in the prevalence of GHQ+, while the change in somatic illness and limitations tended to mitigate this effect. After the recession, unemployed men showed a better level of somatic health. The same effects were not detected in women. CONCLUSIONS: The economic recession exerted a complex effect on mental health problems in men. The reduction of prevalence in women was not associated with changes in socioeconomic factors related to the economic crisis nor with changes in somatic health.","['Moncho, Joaquin', 'Pereyra-Zamora, Pamela', 'Tamayo-Fonseca, Nayara', 'Giron, Manuel', 'Gomez-Beneyto, Manuel', 'Nolasco, Andreu']","['Moncho J', 'Pereyra-Zamora P', 'Tamayo-Fonseca N', 'Giron M', 'Gomez-Beneyto M', 'Nolasco A']","['Research Unit for the Analysis of Mortality and Health Statistics, University of Alicante, Campus de San Vicente del Raspeig s/n, Ap. 99, 03080, Alicante, Spain.', 'Research Unit for the Analysis of Mortality and Health Statistics, University of Alicante, Campus de San Vicente del Raspeig s/n, Ap. 99, 03080, Alicante, Spain. pamela.pereyra@ua.es.', 'Research Unit for the Analysis of Mortality and Health Statistics, University of Alicante, Campus de San Vicente del Raspeig s/n, Ap. 99, 03080, Alicante, Spain.', 'Research Unit for the Analysis of Mortality and Health Statistics, University of Alicante, Campus de San Vicente del Raspeig s/n, Ap. 99, 03080, Alicante, Spain.', 'CIBERSAM, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'CIBERSAM, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Teaching Unit of Psychiatry and Psychological Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Research Unit for the Analysis of Mortality and Health Statistics, University of Alicante, Campus de San Vicente del Raspeig s/n, Ap. 99, 03080, Alicante, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180713,England,BMC Med Res Methodol,BMC medical research methodology,100968545,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Economic Recession/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Mental Health/standards/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Spain/epidemiology', '*Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",PMC6044068,,['NOTNLM'],"['Economic recession', 'Mental health', 'Population study', 'Prevalence', 'Unemployment']",2018/07/14 06:00,2019/06/04 06:00,['2018/07/14 06:00'],"['2017/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12874-018-0538-2 [pii]', '538 [pii]', '10.1186/s12874-018-0538-2 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Res Methodol. 2018 Jul 13;18(1):78. doi: 10.1186/s12874-018-0538-2.,1,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8993-3349'],,"['ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: This research is a transversal', 'observational study based on administrative data.

The mental health priorities of the Nordic Council of Ministers in 2010 signalled a mutual Nordic exchange of knowledge in the following thematic areas: child and adolescent mental health; working life and mental health; mental health in older people; strengthening the role of primary care in mental health service provision; stronger involvement of users and carers; and reduction of use of coercion in psychiatric care. Efforts to realize these priorities included commissioning the Nordic Research Academy for Mental Health, an NHV-based network of research institutions with a common interest in mental health research across the Nordic countries, to develop, organize and follow-up projects on public mental health. The research initiatives included mental health policy analysis, register-based research and research focused on the users' perspective in a Nordic context, as well as EU-level research policy analysis. The public mental health research conducted at the NHV highlighted the complexity of mental health and emphasized that the broad determinants of mental health need to be increasingly addressed in both public health research and practice. For example, health promotion actions, improved access to health care, a healthy alcohol policy and prevention of suicides and violence are all needed to reduce the life expectancy gap - a red flag indicator of public health inequalities.

Study I and II had cross-sectional designs and used logistic regression analysis to study differences in poor mental health (measured with prescribed psychotropic drugs purchased) between refugee and non-refugee immigrants. In Study I, there was a significant difference in poor mental health between female refugees and non-refugees (OR=1.27; CI=1.15-1.40) when adjusted for socio-economic factors. In Study II, refugees of most origins had a higher likelihood of poor mental health than non-refugees of the same origin. Study III and IV had cohort designs and used Cox regression analysis. Study III analysed mortality rates among non-labour immigrants. Male refugees had higher relative risks of mortality from cardiovascular disease (HR=1.53; CI=1.04-2.24) and external causes (HR=1.59; CI=1.01-2.50) than male non-refugees did, adjusted for socio-economic factors. Study IV included the population with a strong connection to the labour market in 1999 to analyse the relative risk of hospitalisation due to depressive disorder following unemployment. The lowest relative risk was found among employed Swedish-born men and the highest among foreign-born females who lost employment during follow-up (HR=3.47; CI=3.02-3.98). Immigrants, and particularly refugees, have poorer mental health than native Swedes. Refugee men have a higher relative mortality risk for cardiovascular disease and external causes of death than do non-refugees. The relative risk of hospitalisation due to depressive disorder following unemployment was highest among immigrant women. To promote mental health and reduce mortality among immigrants, it is important to consider pre- and post-migration factors and the general social determinants of health.","['Hollander, Anna-Clara']",['Hollander AC'],"['Division of Social Medicine, Department of Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. anna-clara.hollander@ki.se']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130627,United States,Glob Health Action,Global health action,101496665,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Emigrants and Immigrants/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', '*Health Status Disparities', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology', '*Mental Health/ethnology/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', '*Mortality/ethnology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Refugees/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Registries', 'Social Determinants of Health', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3696128,,['NOTNLM'],"['immigrants', 'mental health', 'mortality', 'refugees', 'register data', 'social inequalities']",2013/07/03 06:00,2014/02/01 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['21059 [pii]', '10.3402/gha.v6i0.21059 [doi]']",epublish,Glob Health Action. 2013 Jun 27;6:21059. doi: 10.3402/gha.v6i0.21059.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using data from a contemporary, nationally representative sample of 3151 U.S. military veterans maintained by GfK Knowledge Networks, Inc., we evaluated the relation between R/S and a broad range of mental health, and psychosocial variables. Veterans were grouped into three groups based on scores on the Duke University Religion Index: High R/S (weighted 11.6%), Moderate R/S (79.7%) and Low R/S (8.7%). RESULTS: A ""dose-response"" protective association between R/S groups and several mental health outcomes was revealed, even after adjustment for sociodemographic and military variables. High R/S was associated with decreased risk for lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder (odds ratio [OR]=0.46), major depressive disorder (MDD; OR=0.50), and alcohol use disorder (OR=0.66), while Moderate R/S was associated with decreased risk for lifetime MDD (OR=0.66), current suicidal ideation (OR=0.63), and alcohol use disorder (OR=0.76). Higher levels of R/S were also strongly linked with increased dispositional gratitude, purpose in life, and posttraumatic growth. LIMITATIONS: In this cross-sectional study, no conclusions regarding causality can be made. The study provides a current snapshot of the link between R/S and mental health. The study also cannot determine whether religious coping styles (negative vs positive coping) contributed to observed differences. CONCLUSIONS: Although the present study does not have treatment implications, our results suggest that higher levels of R/S may help buffer risk for certain mental disorders and promote protective psychosocial characteristics in U.S. military veterans.","['Sharma, Vanshdeep', 'Marin, Deborah B', 'Koenig, Harold K', 'Feder, Adriana', 'Iacoviello, Brian M', 'Southwick, Steven M', 'Pietrzak, Robert H']","['Sharma V', 'Marin DB', 'Koenig HK', 'Feder A', 'Iacoviello BM', 'Southwick SM', 'Pietrzak RH']","['Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Center for Spirituality and Health, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.

METHODS: This study included 2,674 individuals who died by suicide between 2000 and 2013 along with 267,400 controls matched on year and location in a case-control study conducted in 2016 across eight Mental Health Research Network healthcare systems. A total of 19 physical health conditions were identified using diagnostic codes within the healthcare systems' Virtual Data Warehouse, including electronic health record and insurance claims data, during the year before index date. RESULTS: Seventeen physical health conditions were associated with increased suicide risk after adjustment for age and sex (p<0.001); nine associations persisted after additional adjustment for mental health and substance use diagnoses. Three conditions had a more than twofold increased suicide risk: traumatic brain injury (AOR=8.80, p<0.001); sleep disorders; and HIV/AIDS. Multimorbidity was present in 38% of cases versus 15.5% of controls, and represented nearly a twofold increased risk for suicide. CONCLUSIONS: Although several individual conditions, for example, traumatic brain injury, were associated with high risk of suicide, nearly all physical health conditions increased suicide risk, even after adjustment for potential confounders. In addition, having multiple physical health conditions increased suicide risk substantially. These data support suicide prevention based on the overall burden of physical health.","['Ahmedani, Brian K', 'Peterson, Edward L', 'Hu, Yong', 'Rossom, Rebecca C', 'Lynch, Frances', 'Lu, Christine Y', 'Waitzfelder, Beth E', 'Owen-Smith, Ashli A', 'Hubley, Samuel', 'Prabhakar, Deepak', 'Williams, L Keoki', 'Zeld, Nicole', 'Mutter, Elizabeth', 'Beck, Arne', 'Tolsma, Dennis', 'Simon, Gregory E']","['Ahmedani BK', 'Peterson EL', 'Hu Y', 'Rossom RC', 'Lynch F', 'Lu CY', 'Waitzfelder BE', 'Owen-Smith AA', 'Hubley S', 'Prabhakar D', 'Williams LK', 'Zeld N', 'Mutter E', 'Beck A', 'Tolsma D', 'Simon GE']","['Center for Health Policy and Health Services Research, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Michigan; Behavioral Health Services, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Michigan.

Recent work has identified symptoms of guilt and shame related to moral injury as contributing significantly to combat-related mental health issues. This systematic scoping review explores the association between morality and symptoms of guilt and shame within military forces. METHOD: A search of the literature pertaining to guilt, shame and morality within military samples was conducted. RESULTS: Nineteen articles were selected for review. There is strong evidence linking exposure to and the perceived perpetration of moral transgressions with experiences of guilt and shame. Critically, symptoms of guilt and shame were related to adverse mental health outcomes, particularly the onset of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). No studies have explored moral judgment in conjunction with assessments of guilt or moral injury. CONCLUSION: These findings have important implications for the prevention and treatment of PTSD-related symptoms in military samples. By measuring moral judgment prior to deployment, it may be possible to predict the likelihood of incurring moral injuries and the development of associated symptoms. Early intervention programmes aimed at ameliorating guilt and shame are required to prevent the long-term development of deployment-related psychological distress.","['Nazarov, A', 'Jetly, R', 'McNeely, H', 'Kiang, M', 'Lanius, R', 'McKinnon, M C']","['Nazarov A', 'Jetly R', 'McNeely H', 'Kiang M', 'Lanius R', 'McKinnon MC']","['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', ""Mood Disorders Program, St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, Hamilton, ON, Canada."", 'Department of National Defence, Government of Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', ""Clinical Neuropsychology Service, St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, Hamilton, ON, Canada."", 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', ""Mood Disorders Program, St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, Hamilton, ON, Canada."", 'Homewood Research Institute, Guelph, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20150303,United States,Acta Psychiatr Scand,Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,0370364,IM,"['Female', '*Guilt', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Military Personnel/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Morals', 'Severity of Illness Index', '*Shame']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['guilt', 'military personnel', 'moral injury', 'morality', 'post-traumatic stress disorder', 'shame']",2015/03/05 06:00,2016/02/16 06:00,['2015/03/05 06:00'],"['2015/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/acps.12406 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Psychiatr Scand. 2015 Jul;132(1):4-19. doi: 10.1111/acps.12406.

Using this perspective does not resolve all of the quandaries which philosophers of medicine face when trying to provide a general definition of disease. However, it does take an important step toward clarifying why current methods of psychiatric diagnosis are criticizable and how clinicians can improve the identification of true mental disorders. According to Darwinian psychiatry, the validity of the conventional criteria of psychiatric morbidity is dependent on their association with functional impairment. Suffering, statistical deviance, and physical lesion are frequent correlates of mental disorders but, in absence of dysfunctional consequences, none of these criteria is sufficient for considering a psychological or behavioral condition as a psychiatric disorder. The Darwinian concept of mental disorder builds from two basic ideas: (1) the capacity to achieve biological goals is the best single attribute that characterizes mental health; and (2), the assessment of functional capacities cannot be properly made without consideration of the environment in which the individual lives. These two ideas reflect a concept of mental disorder that is both functional and ecological. A correct application of evolutionary knowledge should not necessarily lead to the conclusion that therapeutic intervention should be limited to conditions that jeopardize biological adaptation. Because one of the basic aims of medicine is to alleviate human suffering, an understanding of the evolutionary foundations of the concept of mental disorder should translate into more effective ways for promoting individual and social well-being, not into the search for natural laws determining what is therapeutically right or wrong.","['Troisi, Alfonso', 'McGuire, Michael']","['Troisi A', 'McGuire M']","['Department of Neurosciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy. alfonso.troisi@uniroma2.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Sweden,Neuro Endocrinol Lett,Neuro endocrinology letters,8008373,IM,"['*Biological Evolution', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Mental Health', '*Psychiatry', 'Stress, Psychological']",,,,,2002/12/24 04:00,2007/05/18 09:00,['2002/12/24 04:00'],"['2002/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2002/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/12/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2002/12/24 04:00 [entrez]']",['NEL231002R03 [pii]'],ppublish,Neuro Endocrinol Lett. 2002 Dec;23 Suppl 4:31-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,48,,,,,,,,,,

Although urban living offers increased access to critical resources and can help to mitigate climate change, densely populated neighborhood environments are often higher in many of the physical and psychological stressors that are detrimental to health, and lower in the social capital that is beneficial to health. One component of urban form that can reduce these stressors and improve social capital is nature: greenspace, such as parks and street trees, and bluespace, such as rivers and oceans. In this project, we applied measures from a Natural Space Index previously developed for the Vancouver, Canada census metropolitan area to explore the relationship between distinct measures of natural space and prevalence of (1) major depressive disorder, (2) negative mental health, and (3) psychological distress. In addition, we examined direct associations between natural space exposure and neighborhood social capital, as measured via self-reported sense of community belonging (SoC), as well as the potential mental health benefits of natural space mediated via SoC. Using data from the population-based, cross-sectional 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (weighted n = 1,930,048), we found no direct associations between any measure of natural space and mental health in models adjusted for 11 demographic, socioeconomic, household arrangement, health, and urban design variables. However, publicly accessible neighborhood nature was associated with increased odds of higher SoC. A 1% increase in the percentage of natural space (combined greenspace and bluespace) within 500 m had an odds ratio [95% confidence interval] of 1.05 [1.00, 1.10] for very strong vs. very weak SoC and 1.04 [1.01, 1.08] for somewhat strong vs. very weak SoC. In addition, higher levels of SoC were associated with improvements in all three mental health outcomes. Mediation tests indicated significant indirect effects of both publicly accessible neighborhood nature variables on reductions in psychological distress and reduced odds of negative mental health via increased sense of SoC. This suggests that natural space has the potential to address the pressing issue of social isolation and, in turn, poor mental health faced by residents of dense urban environments.","['Rugel, Emily J', 'Carpiano, Richard M', 'Henderson, Sarah B', 'Brauer, Michael']","['Rugel EJ', 'Carpiano RM', 'Henderson SB', 'Brauer M']","['School of Population & Public Health, 2206 E Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z9, Canada.

Another factor is job insecurity: fear of job loss increases the incidence of disease, and this applies not only to people who are emotionally unstable. Illness may lead to unemployment: in many cases, unemployment is caused by previous health impairments, which, to a considerable extent, also explain the duration of unemployment. Unemployment may lead to illness: there is evidence that unemployment not only reinforces existing physical disease but also acts as a risk factor for new ones. This seems particularly true for problem groups such as the unemployed elderly as well as for infants and children of unemployed people. The relations between unemployment and mental health are strong, mainly in terms of depression and alcoholism. Unemployment may lead to health: short-time work and short-term unemployment may improve health by reducing previous stress, caused by employment or by an overload with social roles. Even in the case of long-term unemployment there are some positive health effects as long as a minimum of social security and alternative social roles are available and useful activities--minor agricultural jobs, illicit work--can be carried out. The links between unemployment, work and society can considerably be loosened by a number of social factors and personal characteristics of the people affected. Existing health services are not in a position to deal with disease stemming from employment or unemployment except through symptomatical and curative therapies. In addition to general medical care, which is guaranteed by the German health insurance system for the unemployed, too, therapeutical measures are especially important in cases of depression and alcoholism. As a rule, the medical profession has no knowledge of the links between health, work and unemployment; such knowledge, however, would facilitate prevention. Individual prevention and rehabilitation measures are of great importance to problem groups suffering from cumulative or indirect unemployment, i.e. to unemployed elderly as well as to children of unemployed parents. Since the unemployed tend to isolate themselves, extramural services are useful. Specific services for the unemployed only are certainly not as helpful as multi-functional social services, such as those being already rendered by some self-help organizations, churches and trade-unions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Schwefel, D']",['Schwefel D'],,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Austria', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Female', 'Germany, West', '*Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Life Change Events', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Risk', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress, Psychological/etiology', 'Switzerland', '*Unemployment', 'Work']",,,,,1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0277-9536(86)90047-x [doi]'],ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 1986;22(4):409-30. doi: 10.1016/0277-9536(86)90047-x.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,269,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Using a one-phase design, 10,438 children were assessed using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA), a structured interview with verbatim reports reviewed by clinicians so that information from parents, teachers, and children was combined in a manner that emulated the clinical process. The authors' analysis examined comorbidity and the influence of teacher reports. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of DSM-IV disorders was 9.5% (95% confidence interval 8.8-10.1%), but 2.1% of children were assigned ""not otherwise specified"" rather than operationalized diagnoses. After adjusting for the presence of a third disorder, there was no longer significant comorbidity between anxiety and conduct disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or between depression and oppositional defiant disorder. A comparison of the disorders in children with and without teacher reports suggested that the prevalence of conduct disorders and ADHD would be underestimated in the absence of teacher information. CONCLUSIONS: Roughly 1 in 10 children have at least one DSM-IV disorder, involving a level of distress or social impairment likely to warrant treatment. Comorbidity reported between some childhood diagnoses may be due to the association of both disorders with a third. Diagnoses of conduct disorder and ADHD may be missed if information is not sought from teachers about children's functioning in school.","['Ford, Tamsin', 'Goodman, Robert', 'Meltzer, Howard']","['Ford T', 'Goodman R', 'Meltzer H']","['Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Denmark Hill, London SE58AF, England. t.ford@iop.kcl.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry,Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,8704565,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', 'Social Behavior', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,,,,2003/10/16 05:00,2003/11/05 05:00,['2003/10/16 05:00'],"['2003/10/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0890-8567(09)61983-3 [pii]', '10.1097/00004583-200310000-00011 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2003 Oct;42(10):1203-11. doi: 10.1097/00004583-200310000-00011.,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sample was randomly selected and consists of men and women between 65 and 84 years of age (N = 555) from the Community of Madrid. Mental disorders were evaluated with the CIDI65+ interview and QoL with the WHOQoL-BREF scale. Means, ANOVA and multiple linear regression analyses were performed. Women have worse QoL than men and QoL worsens with age. The regression model for the dependent variable ""WHOQoL BREF Scale"" explains 41.43% of the variance (R(2) = 0.413). The variables that have the greatest impact on QoL are as follows: a greater number of physical and psychological symptoms, experiencing financial difficulties and the presence of a psychological disorder, while continuing to work has a positive effect on QoL. Physical and mental disorders have a similar impact on QoL. The presence of a greater number of psychological symptoms (without necessarily fulfilling the criteria of a mental disorder) is a predictive variable of worse QoL.

It assessed the prevalence of major mental disorders in the general population with 15,747 people aged 18 years and above in 18 sites worldwide: 6 European sites, 4 sites in the Maghreb, 4 sites in the Indian Ocean, 2 sites in the Caribbean and two sites in the Pacific Ocean. OBJECTIVES: To assess the risk of the presence of at least one mental disorder in terms of sociodemographic factors (gender, age, marital status, family income, education level, professional activity, religious practice and social isolation) and location (zone [Europe, North Africa, Indian Ocean, Caribbean Islands and the Indian Ocean Islands] and ""investigation site""). METHODOLOGY: Statistical analysis was performed using data collected in 18 international sites of the MHGP survey. Logistic regression was used to model the relationship between sociodemographic and geographic factors and the presence of at least one disorder (mood disorder, anxiety disorder, psychotic disorder, abuse or dependence on alcohol or drugs), evaluated with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) diagnostic questionnaire. RESULTS: The prevalence of mental disorders rates vary among 18 sites, ranging from 15.5 % (Andorra) to 60 % (Algiers). The adjusted global epidemiological model (18 cluster sites) confirms a decreased level of risk of at least a psychiatric pathology due to a favorable sociodemographic ""profile"": marital status (married), family income (higher), age group (60 years and above), educational level (university), gender (male), practice of religion (among believers), employment (exercised). Analysis at geographical situation's level confirms existence of sub socio-geo-demographic models differentiated by ranking and levels of variables' modalities. Classification of variables and their modalities is clearly differentiated not only between 5 zones, but also within each of them depending on the sites that comprise it. This produces differentiated models for each of the 18 survey sites. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of sociodemographic risk factors on mental health is confirmed regardless of World region. However, the implementation of action plans for the prevention of mental disorders requires a detailed understanding of people's needs in terms of the disorder's prevalence, nature and strength of risk factors, at regional and local levels. This observation provides incentives to develop this research axis in world francophone and Latin speaking areas. These epidemiological results can be refined thanks to the data collected in the MHGP surveys about each mental disorder and comorbid conditions, the recourse of populations to assistance or care, as well as results of the socio-anthropological axis.","['Chabaud, F', 'Benradia, I', 'Bouet, R', 'Caria, A', 'Roelandt, J L']","['Chabaud F', 'Benradia I', 'Bouet R', 'Caria A', 'Roelandt JL']","[""Departement d'information medicale, hopital Henri-Laborit, 370, avenue Jacques-Coeur, BP587, 86021 Poitiers cedex, France.

The aim of this study was to replicate and expand existing knowledge by studying CMD severity and its association with treatment contact and treatment intensity in The Netherlands. METHOD: Data were obtained from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (NEMESIS-2), a nationally representative face-to-face survey of the general population aged 18-64 years (n=6646, response rate=65.1%). DSM-IV diagnoses and disorder severity were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Version 3.0 (CIDI 3.0). Treatment contact refers to at least one contact for mental health problems made in the general medical care (GMC) or mental health care (MHC) sector. Four levels of treatment intensity were assessed, based on type and duration of therapy received. RESULTS: Although CMD severity was related to treatment contact, only 39.0% of severe cases received MHC. At the same time, 40.3% of MHC users did not have a 12-month disorder. Increasing levels of treatment intensity ranged from 51.6% to 13.0% in GMC and from 81.4% to 51.1% in MHC. CMD severity was related to treatment intensity in MHC but not in GMC. Sociodemographic characteristics were not significantly related to having experienced the highest level of treatment intensity in MHC. CONCLUSIONS. Mental health treatment in the GMC sector should be improved, especially when policy is aimed at increasing the role of primary care in the management of mental health problems.","['Ten Have, M', 'Nuyen, J', 'Beekman, A', 'de Graaf, R']","['Ten Have M', 'Nuyen J', 'Beekman A', 'de Graaf R']","['Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction, Utrecht, The Netherlands. mhave@trimbos.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130207,England,Psychol Med,Psychological medicine,1254142,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Health Services/*statistics & numerical data', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Mental Health Services/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2013/02/08 06:00,2014/04/23 06:00,['2013/02/08 06:00'],"['2013/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0033291713000135 [pii]', '10.1017/S0033291713000135 [doi]']",ppublish,Psychol Med. 2013 Oct;43(10):2203-13. doi: 10.1017/S0033291713000135.

In this study, we explored these time-varying associations. METHODS: We used data from the first four waves (October, 2013, to February, 2017) of a national refugee-based longitudinal study, the Building a New Life in Australia (BNLA) project. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and high risk of severe mental illness (HR-SMI) were used to assess mental health. The independent variables included the number of potentially traumatic events experienced during the pre-migration process, and a range of post-migration stressors. We used logistic regression models to analyse the relative importance of variables and time-varying associations between the pre-migration potentially traumatic events, post-migration resettlement stressors, and refugees' mental health. Analyses were stratified by gender, and sociodemographic covariates included age, marital status, education level, country of birth, and weekly income. RESULTS: 2399 participants were surveyed in Wave 1 of the BNLA project in 2013-14, of whom 2009 (83.7%) responded in Wave 2 in 2014-15, 1894 (78.9%) in Wave 3 in 2015-16, and 1929 (80.4%) in Wave 4 in 2016-17. The three most important factors associated with mental health in each wave differed for male and female refugees, but the socioeconomic stressors of loneliness and adjustment to life in Australia were consistently prominent. Positive associations between socioeconomic stressors and mental ill-health were found for both genders, with a peak at Wave 2 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] among men, 1.60 [95% CI 1.26-2.03], p=0.0001 for PTSD; AOR 1.86 [1.35-2.55], p=0.0001 for HR-SMI; and among women, AOR 1.81 [1.27-2.57], p=0.0009 for PTSD; AOR 2.24 [1.49-3.38], p=0.0001 for HR-SMI). Associations between loneliness and mental health fluctuated, but were significant for both genders in Wave 4 (among men, AOR 1.90 [1.21-2.99], p=0.0051 for PTSD; AOR 3.70 [2.18-6.27], p<0.0001 for HR-SMI; and among women, AOR 3.65 [2.08-6.39], p<0.0001 for PTSD; AOR 3.68 [2.02-6.69], p<0.0001 for HR-SMI). The association between difficulties in adjustment to life in Australia and male refugees' mental ill-health increased continuously during the resettlement period. INTERPRETATION: Gender-specific and time-sensitive services should be considered to improve refugees' mental health. For both genders, improved economic conditions that complement social security benefits deserve attention and are relevant throughout the resettlement process. At the later stage of resettlement, services to reduce loneliness could be carried out, and reducing stressors related to adjustment to life in the host country is especially needed for male refugees.

Reduced differences in financial requirements (i.e., copayments and coinsurance) for substance use disorder (SUD) versus specialty mental health (MH) care and 2. Reductions in the level of cost-sharing for SUD-specific services. METHODS: MH and SUD copayments and coinsurance, 2008-2013, were obtained from benefits databases for carve-in and carve-out plans from Optum((R)). Linear regression was used to estimate the association of MHPAEA with differences between MH and SUD care financial requirements among carve-in and carve-out plans. A two-part regression model investigated whether MHPAEA was associated with changes in the use or level of financial requirements for SUD-specific services among carve-out plans. RESULTS: MHPAEA was not associated with significant changes in the difference between SUD and MH copayments or coinsurance levels among either carve-in or carve-out plans. MHPAEA was associated with decreases in the levels of inpatient (in-network: -$51.17; out-of-network: -$34.39) and outpatient (in-network: -$10.26) detox copayments, but increases in the levels of in-network outpatient detox coinsurance (6 percentage points) among all carve-out plans. CONCLUSION: Even if SUD benefits had been historically less generous than MH benefits, SUD financial requirements were already at parity with MH financial requirements by the time MHPAEA was passed, among Optum((R)) plans. MHPAEA's SUD parity mandate reduced cost-sharing for detox services via copayments, but, for outpatient detox, the law simultaneously increased cost-sharing via coinsurance.","['Friedman, Sarah A', 'Azocar, Francisca', 'Xu, Haiyong', 'Ettner, Susan L']","['Friedman SA', 'Azocar F', 'Xu H', 'Ettner SL']","['Department of Health Policy and Management, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, 911 S.

Six months after the inclusion in the MFT, the experimental group showed a significant decrease in number of visits to the psychiatric emergency services, number of psychiatric admissions, and the days of admission. The need for hospital care 6 months after recruitment was also lower in the experimental group compared to the control group.

Its origin can be traced to Plato, who argued that immorality is to the soul what disease is to the body. The purpose of this argument was to answer those who thought that morality is a set of social conventions, and in that sense, is contrary to nature. Plato responded by turning to those who made a systematic study of nature--the medical writers of his day--and claiming that if proper balance is needed to maintain a healthy body, the same is true of the soul. Thus the natural state of the soul is one in which the various parts agree on which should rule. This does not mean that Plato sought to excuse immoral behavior by treating it as a medical condition, only that he regarded immoral behavior as contrary to nature and thus treatable. Although later attempts to define mental health are not as rigid as Plato's, it is remarkable how many of his insights are still applicable, in particular the claim that morality and mental health, though not identical, are nonetheless linked. A case in point is the experience of wanting something but not liking the fact that you want it. Plato regarded internal conflict of this sort as a paradigm case of psychic dysfunction. I argue that we can regard it as either a moral failing or a mental one.","['Seeskin, Kenneth']",['Seeskin K'],"['Department of Philosophy, Northwestern University, 1880 Campus Drive, Evanston, IL 60208, USA. k-seeskin@northwestern.edu']",['eng'],,"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",20081028,Netherlands,Int J Law Psychiatry,International journal of law and psychiatry,7806862,IM,"['Greek World', 'History, Medieval', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*history', 'Mental Health/*history']",,,,,2008/10/31 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2008/10/31 09:00'],"['2008/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0160-2527(08)00119-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijlp.2008.09.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Law Psychiatry. 2008 Dec;31(6):487-94. doi: 10.1016/j.ijlp.2008.09.004.

Expert consensus existed with regard to the importance of three challenges in the field of clinical mental health research: (1) the development of new, safe and effective interventions for mental disorders; (2) understanding the mechanisms of disease in order to be able to develop such new interventions; and (3) defining outcomes (an improved set of outcomes, including alternative outcomes) to use for clinical mental health research evaluation. Proposed actions involved increasing the utilization of tailored approaches (personalized medicine), developing blended eHealth/mHealth decision aids/guidance tools that help the clinician to choose between various treatment modalities, developing specific treatments in order to better target comorbidity and (further) development of biological, psychological and psychopharmacological interventions. The experts indicated that addressing these priorities will result in increased efficacy and impact across Europe; with a high probability of success, given that Europe has important strengths, such as skilled academics and a long research history.

This includes stigmatisation by care professionals. Stigma is considered one of the most important barriers for recovery from these conditions. There is an ongoing debate that use of language can exacerbate or diminish stigmatisation. Therefore, we conducted an experiment examining how four different ways of referring to a person with (a) alcohol addiction, (b) drug addiction, (c) depression and (d) schizophrenia are related to stigmatising attitudes by care professionals in the Netherlands. We partially replicated two studies performed in the United States and used surveys with vignettes containing either 'disorder-first', 'person-first', 'victim' and 'recovery' language, which were randomly assigned to participants (n = 361). No significant differences between language conditions were found for any of the vignettes. Our findings suggest that subtle differences in language to refer to persons with mental health problems or substance addictions have no effect on stigmatising attitudes by care professionals in the Netherlands. However, more research is needed to determine the effect of language use on other groups, such as individuals with MHPSA.","['Martinelli, Thomas F', 'Meerkerk, Gert-Jan', 'Nagelhout, Gera E', 'Brouwers, Evelien P M', 'van Weeghel, Jaap', 'Rabbers, Gerdien', 'van de Mheen, Dike']","['Martinelli TF', 'Meerkerk GJ', 'Nagelhout GE', 'Brouwers EPM', 'van Weeghel J', 'Rabbers G', 'van de Mheen D']","['IVO Research Institute, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Tranzo Scientific Center for Care and Wellbeing, School of Social and Behavioural Sciences, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands.', 'IVO Research Institute, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'IVO Research Institute, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Health Promotion and Department of Family Medicine, Maastricht University (CAPHRI), Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Tranzo Scientific Center for Care and Wellbeing, School of Social and Behavioural Sciences, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands.', 'Tranzo Scientific Center for Care and Wellbeing, School of Social and Behavioural Sciences, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands.', 'Phrenos Centre of Expertise, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Dijk en Duin Mental Health Center, Parnassia Bavo Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Samen Sterk Zonder Stigma, Amersfoort, The Netherlands.', 'Tranzo Scientific Center for Care and Wellbeing, School of Social and Behavioural Sciences, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200310,England,Health Soc Care Community,Health & social care in the community,9306359,IM,"['Adult', 'Alcoholism/psychology', '*Attitude to Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Language', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*psychology', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Netherlands', '*Social Stigma', '*Stereotyping', 'Substance-Related Disorders/*psychology']",PMC7496658,,['NOTNLM'],"['experiment', 'language', 'mental health', 'professionals', 'stigma', 'substance addiction']",2020/03/11 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2019/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['HSC12973 [pii]', '10.1111/hsc.12973 [doi]']",ppublish,Health Soc Care Community. 2020 Sep;28(5):1504-1513. doi: 10.1111/hsc.12973.

METHODS: FDNY schedules routine monitoring exams every 12-18 months and physical and mental health treatment appointments, as required. RESULTS: FDNY research studies have consistently found that early arrival to work and/or prolonged work at the WTC-site increased the risks for adverse physical and mental health outcomes. To date, a substantial proportion has been diagnosed with obstructive airways disease, chronic rhinosinusitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease; a quarter has two or more of these conditions.

This standard should be adopted because of the greater availability of, and familiarity with, recording technology on the part of mental health professionals, the greater use and proven effectiveness of recording in other contexts of the criminal justice system, and the improvement in court presentation and accuracy of judicial determinations involving forensic assessments that recording will provide. The experience of practitioners with recording since professional associations last studied the issue should be taken into account, as informal data suggest it has been positive. Unfortunately, the legal system is unlikely to prompt this advance without its reconsideration by the forensic mental health professions, because current constitutional jurisprudence does not require recording and effectively makes it contingent upon request by examiners. Forensic evaluators thus have a valuable opportunity to educate the legal system on the utility and importance of this key reform, and so should adopt it as a best practice.","['Siegel, David M', 'Kinscherff, Robert']","['Siegel DM', 'Kinscherff R']","['Center for Law and Social Responsibility, New England Law-Boston, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology, William James College, Newton, MA, USA.', 'Core Science Faculty, Center for Law, Brain and Behavior, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180425,United States,Behav Sci Law,Behavioral sciences & the law,8404861,IM,"['Criminals/*psychology', 'Forensic Psychiatry/*methods', 'Forensic Sciences/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*diagnosis/psychology', 'Mental Health/classification/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'United States']",,,,,2018/04/27 06:00,2018/10/05 06:00,['2018/04/27 06:00'],"['2017/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bsl.2349 [doi]'],ppublish,Behav Sci Law. 2018 May;36(3):373-389. doi: 10.1002/bsl.2349.

In contrast, prevention strategies for mental disorders remain in their infancy. This paper provides a summary of the key issues surrounding mental disorder prevention and proposes a framework for how to catalyze action in the area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three core assumptions guide this work (1) the onset of mental disorders is often preventable, (2) among those individuals with a mental disorder, the trajectory of health and functioning can be shaped by external resources, and (3) many specific and generic risk and protective factors for mental disorders are associated with specific stages of the life course. CONCLUSION: We propose that the adoption of a life course approach to prevention can be clarifying and motivating for both research and practice.","['Rudenstine, Sasha', 'Galea, Sandro']","['Rudenstine S', 'Galea S']","['Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, 722 West 168th Street, 15th Floor, New York, NY, 10032, USA, sr2863@columbia.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150117,Germany,Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,8804358,IM,"['Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*prevention & control', '*Mental Health']",,,,,2015/01/18 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00127-015-1007-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol. 2015 May;50(5):833-41. doi: 10.1007/s00127-015-1007-4.

In developing countries, where half of the population is younger than 18 years old, one of every five children and adolescents is estimated to suffer from a mental health disorder. It is then essential to detect these conditions through screening in a timely and accurate manner. But such screening is fraught with considerable ethical, social, and cultural challenges. This study systematically identifies, for the first time, these challenges, along with potential solutions to address them. We report on the results of an international multi- and inter-disciplinary three-round Delphi survey completed by 135 mental health experts from 37 countries. We asked these experts to identify and rank the main ethical, social, and cultural challenges of screening for child and adolescent mental health problems in developing nations, and to propose solutions for each challenge. Thirty-nine significant challenges emerged around eight themes, along with 32 potential solutions organized into seven themes. There was a high degree of consensus among the experts, but a few interesting disagreements arose between members of the panel from high-income countries and those from low- and middle-income nations. The panelists overwhelmingly supported mental health screening for children and adolescents. They recommended ensuring local acceptance and support for screening prior to program initiation, along with careful and comprehensive protection of human rights; integrating screening procedures into primary care; designing and implementing culturally appropriate screening tools, programs, and follow-up; securing long-term funding; expanding capacity building; and task-shifting screening to local non-specialists. These recommendations can serve as a guide for policy and decision-making, resource allocation, and international cooperation. They also offer a novel approach to reduce the burden of these disorders by encouraging their timely and context-sensitive prevention and management.","['Salamanca-Buentello, Fabio', 'Seeman, Mary V', 'Daar, Abdallah S', 'Upshur, Ross E G']","['Salamanca-Buentello F', 'Seeman MV', 'Daar AS', 'Upshur REG']","['Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Departments of Clinical Public Health and Surgery, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study, Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa.', 'Division of Clinical Public Health, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Bridgepoint Collaboratory for Research and Innovation, Lunenfeld - Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200824,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', '*Culture', '*Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mass Screening', 'Mental Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Mental Health/*ethics', '*Social Behavior', 'Young Adult']",PMC7446846,,,,2020/08/25 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/08/25 06:00'],"['2020/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-20-00075 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0237853 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Aug 24;15(8):e0237853. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0237853. eCollection 2020.,8,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3666-7785'],,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,['figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5086313'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment in hospitals might be complicated by mental health crises or self-injury, and barriers to NHS care may increase the risk of developing further illness with serious consequences. Literature on ""personality disorder"" and the general hospital has to date primarily focused on emergency departments. Research on how general hospital inpatient wards respond to people diagnosed with a ""personality disorder"" has been long overdue. Thirteen clinicians working in mental health liaison in the general hospital were interviewed as part of a sequence of research studies. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE: This study identified unjust and avoidable differences in the care and treatment received by people diagnosed with a ""personality disorder"" in general hospitals. People with a ""personality disorder"" diagnosis were discriminated against and over- and under-medicated. Mental health liaison clinicians reported limited understanding and skills among general hospital clinicians. People working in general hospitals were fearful of the ""personality disorder"" diagnosis. Poor care was accepted because general hospital clinicians did not consider themselves to be ""mental health trained."" WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Clinicians working in mental health liaison need credible knowledge of mental and physical health and medicines. Capability, influence, and high-level interpersonal skills are needed to successfully work across mental health services and the general hospital. More advanced and consultant-level nursing roles in more mental health liaison teams are needed to strengthen this specialist workforce. ABSTRACT: Introduction Literature on ""personality disorder"" and the general hospital has to date primarily focused on emergency departments. Research on how general hospital inpatient wards respond to people diagnosed with a ""personality disorder"" has been long overdue. Aim Qualitative telephone interviews were undertaken to explore the views and perspectives of clinicians working in mental health liaison in this final strand of a mixed methods explanatory sequential study. Method Participants were recruited via social media and professional networks by snowball sampling. Data were analysed using a framework approach. Results Four themes were identified: knowledge, understanding, skills, and discriminatory practice; alliances, diplomacy, care, and treatment of people diagnosed with a ""personality disorder""; achieving parity of esteem in a disparate healthcare system; and organizational stress, mismatched expectations, and service led decision-making. Discussion There were unjust and avoidable differences in the care and treatment received by people diagnosed with a ""personality disorder"" in the general hospital. People were discriminated against and routinely over- and under-medicated. Implications for practice Clinicians working in mental health liaison need capacity for partnership working, clinical capability spanning mental and physical health, credibility and influence and high-level interpersonal skills to address the entrenched discrimination of people diagnosed with a ""personality disorder.""","['Sharda, Leila', 'Baker, John', 'Cahill, Jane']","['Sharda L', 'Baker J', 'Cahill J']","['Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust, Preston, UK.', 'School of Healthcare, University of Leeds, UK.', 'School of Healthcare, University of Leeds, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20220731,England,J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs,Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing,9439514,,"['Humans', '*Mental Health', 'Hospitals, General', 'Personality Disorders/therapy', '*Mental Health Services', 'Personality']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['advanced practice', 'emotional distress', 'hospitals', 'mental health', 'parity of esteem', 'personality disorders', 'psychological distress']",2022/07/28 06:00,2023/03/14 06:00,['2022/07/27 11:03'],"['2022/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2022/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2022/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/03/14 06:00 [medline]', '2022/07/27 11:03 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jpm.12861 [doi]'],ppublish,J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs. 2023 Apr;30(2):245-254. doi: 10.1111/jpm.12861.

The current study examined the association of sleep quality, symptoms of psychological distress and other unusual sleep experiences with EHS in a sample of young adults (n = 135, age M = 21.77, SD = 2.08). We also aimed to account for the possible effect of participant chronotype on sleep experiences. The lifetime prevalence of EHS among participants was 20.0%. Three-quarters (75.6%) of participants reported poor quality sleep according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Univariate analysis showed that participants with a lifetime prevalence of EHS experienced more symptoms of anxiety and poorer sleep quality; age, gender and symptoms of depression were not significantly related to EHS. Parasomnias (OR [95% CI] = 1.62 [1.02-2.57], p = .040) and action-related sleep disorders (OR [95% CI] = 1.87 [1.09-3.20], p = .023) were associated with lifetime experience of EHS in a logistic regression analysis. Chronotype did not significantly impact mood, sleep quality or presence of EHS. Results suggest that EHS is more common in young people than previously considered and ought to be examined in conjunction with the presence of other unusual sleep disorders. This study provides valuable insight into young peoples' sleep experiences and key factors associated with EHS.","['Kirwan, Emma', 'Fortune, Donal G']","['Kirwan E', 'Fortune DG']","['Department of Psychology, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200413,England,J Sleep Res,Journal of sleep research,9214441,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Parasomnias/*physiopathology', 'Sensation Disorders/*physiopathology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Syndrome', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronotype', 'distress', 'exploding head syndrome', 'parasomnia', 'sleep disorder']",2020/04/14 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2020/04/14 06:00'],"['2020/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jsr.13044 [doi]'],ppublish,J Sleep Res. 2021 Apr;30(2):e13044. doi: 10.1111/jsr.13044.

Little data, however, have been collected to evidence change. AIMS: This paper examines whether the reported attitudes and practices of debt collection staff when working with customers with mental health problems have changed between 2010 and 2016. METHOD: This paper draws on descriptive and regression analyses of two cross-sectional surveys of debt collection staff: one conducted in 2010 and one conducted in 2016. RESULTS: All variables analysed show statistically significant changes between 2010 and 2016 indicative of improved reported attitudes and practices. CONCLUSIONS: While results suggest an improvement in attitudes and practice may have occurred between 2010 and 2016, research is required to understand this potential shift, its likely causes, and concrete impact on customers.","['Evans, Jamie', 'Fitch, Christopher', 'Collard, Sharon', 'Henderson, Claire']","['Evans J', 'Fitch C', 'Collard S', 'Henderson C']","['a Personal Finance Research Centre , University of Bristol , Bristol , UK.', 'a Personal Finance Research Centre , University of Bristol , Bristol , UK.', 'b Money Advice Trust , London , UK and.', 'a Personal Finance Research Centre , University of Bristol , Bristol , UK.', ""c King's College London , London , UK.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180427,England,J Ment Health,"Journal of mental health (Abingdon, England)",9212352,IM,"['Attitude', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*economics', 'Mental Health/*economics', '*Patient Credit and Collection']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mental health problems', 'debt', 'debt collection', 'financial difficulty', 'financial services']",2018/04/28 06:00,2019/05/22 06:00,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2018/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09638237.2018.1466040 [doi]'],ppublish,J Ment Health. 2018 Dec;27(6):496-503. doi: 10.1080/09638237.2018.1466040.

METHODS: This was a descriptive, retrospective cross-sectional study of patients who presented to an Australian hospital ED between September 2011 and September 2012. Demographic, clinical and outcomes data were extracted from the ED information system. MH presentations were compared to NMH presentations. RESULTS: Nearly 5% of the 66,678 ED presentations were classified as MH. Compared to the NMH group, a lower proportion in the MH group were seen by a physician within the recommended time frame (39.1% vs. 42.1%, p<0.001); had a higher admission rate (36.6% vs. 20.1%, p<0.001); shorter ED Length of Stay (LoS) if admitted (369 vs. 490min, p<0.001) and longer ED LoS if not admitted (241 vs. 187min, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Time constraints in the busy ED environment are a potential barrier to the delivery of care for all patients who have the right to timely access to health care. Targeted improvements at the front end of the ED system and output processes between ED, community and inpatient admission are recommended for this site.","['Bost, Nerolie', 'Crilly, Julia', 'Wallen, Karen']","['Bost N', 'Crilly J', 'Wallen K']","['Emergency Department, Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service, 1 Hospital Boulevard, Southport 4215, Queensland, Australia.

This phrase captures the diverse motivations of the conscientious objectors but neglects the differences among these motivations. Members of several communities served in the CPS, but half of all volunteers in mental health facilities were Mennonites. After the war, only Mennonite CPS veterans engaged their own community in a discussion about their responsibilities to people with mental illness, which led directly to the foundation of eight mental health facilities, seven of which continue to serve people with mental illness. In this review of materials published by Mennonites, we explore the difference that Mennonite religious ideology, especially the ideas of discipleship and nonresistance, made in their response to people with mental illness. Understanding these differences is critical for any attempts to replicate their success in engendering community care, in which direct conversation and encounter are critical.","['Nussbaum, Abraham M']",['Nussbaum AM'],"['Department of Psychiatry, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.

The fact that there is broad evidence in favor of IMIs and that IMIs have already been implemented in several countries requires an ethical analysis to answer these concerns. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to tackle ethical issues connected to a possible implementation of IMIs for mental disorders in Germany and to point out possible solutions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted an ethical analysis using the criteria of well-being of patients, non-maleficence, justice, and patient autonomy, based on the empirical evidence. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The ethical analysis showed that IMIs for mental disorders principally have a positive effect on the well-being of patients and have a low risk of impairment. Additionally, IMIs can minimize risk, improve justice, and strengthen autonomy of mentally ill patients. Despite the broad evidence, there are still research desiderates with respect to ethical aspects, e. g. patient information for mentally ill patients.","['Rubeis, Giovanni', 'Steger, Florian']","['Rubeis G', 'Steger F']","['Institut fur Geschichte, Theorie und Ethik der Medizin, Universitat Ulm, Parkstrasse 11, 89073, Ulm, Deutschland. giovanni.rubeis@uni-ulm.de.', 'Institut fur Geschichte, Theorie und Ethik der Medizin, Universitat Ulm, Parkstrasse 11, 89073, Ulm, Deutschland.']",['ger'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Nervenarzt,Der Nervenarzt,0400773,IM,"['*Ethical Analysis', 'Germany', 'Humans', '*Internet/ethics/statistics & numerical data', '*Mental Disorders/therapy', 'Mental Health/ethics/statistics & numerical data', '*Mentally Ill Persons/psychology/statistics & numerical data']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Autonomy', 'Ethics', 'Internet-based interventions for mental health', 'Justice', 'Mobile-based interventions for mental health', 'Non-maleficence', 'Well-being of patients']",2019/01/09 06:00,2019/09/13 06:00,['2019/01/09 06:00'],"['2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00115-018-0663-5 [pii]', '10.1007/s00115-018-0663-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Nervenarzt. 2019 May;90(5):497-502. doi: 10.1007/s00115-018-0663-5.,5,,,,,Internet- und mobilgestutzte Interventionen bei psychischen Storungen : Implementierung in Deutschland aus ethischer Sicht.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a topological approach linking entities from different scales of analysis of an individual (from genetics to behavior, via cerebral connectivity). They are an alternative to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), but they do not exclude them. Symptom networks exceed or circumvent some limits of these classifications. Furthermore, they contribute to the stratification and organization of these nosologies. Behind the originality of its methodology, this program proposes a redefinition of mental illness which modifies the conception of psychiatry.

Here, we argue that accounting for host-gut microbe interactions will improve understanding and management of health inequities, and that health policy must begin to consider the microbiome as an important pathway linking environments to population health.","['Amato, Katherine R', 'Arrieta, Marie-Claire', 'Azad, Meghan B', 'Bailey, Michael T', 'Broussard, Josiane L', 'Bruggeling, Carlijn E', 'Claud, Erika C', 'Costello, Elizabeth K', 'Davenport, Emily R', 'Dutilh, Bas E', 'Swain Ewald, Holly A', 'Ewald, Paul', 'Hanlon, Erin C', 'Julion, Wrenetha', 'Keshavarzian, Ali', 'Maurice, Corinne F', 'Miller, Gregory E', 'Preidis, Geoffrey A', 'Segurel, Laure', 'Singer, Burton', 'Subramanian, Sathish', 'Zhao, Liping', 'Kuzawa, Christopher W']","['Amato KR', 'Arrieta MC', 'Azad MB', 'Bailey MT', 'Broussard JL', 'Bruggeling CE', 'Claud EC', 'Costello EK', 'Davenport ER', 'Dutilh BE', 'Swain Ewald HA', 'Ewald P', 'Hanlon EC', 'Julion W', 'Keshavarzian A', 'Maurice CF', 'Miller GE', 'Preidis GA', 'Segurel L', 'Singer B', 'Subramanian S', 'Zhao L', 'Kuzawa CW']","['Department of Anthropology, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208;

METHODS: Using data from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health, we identified children aged 2 to 17 years with >/=1 mental health condition (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, or depression) who had received >/=2 types of preventive or subspecialty health services in the past year. We defined 2 outcome measures of interest: (1) prevalence of need for care coordination; and (2) prevalence of unmet need for care coordination in those with a need. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations of clinical, sociodemographic, parent psychosocial, and health care characteristics with the outcome measures. RESULTS: In our sample (N = 7501, representing an estimated 5,750,000 children), the prevalence of having any need for care coordination was 43.2%. Among parents reporting a need for care coordination, the prevalence of unmet need was 41.2%. Higher risk of unmet need for care coordination was associated with child anxiety disorder, parenting stress, lower income, and public or no insurance. Parents reporting social support and receipt of family-centered care had a lower risk of unmet need for care coordination. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 40% of parents of children with mental health conditions who reported a need for care coordination also reported that their need was unmet. Delivery of family-centered care and enhancing family supports may help to reduce unmet need for care coordination in this vulnerable population.","['Brown, Nicole M', 'Green, Jeremy C', 'Desai, Mayur M', 'Weitzman, Carol C', 'Rosenthal, Marjorie S']","['Brown NM', 'Green JC', 'Desai MM', 'Weitzman CC', 'Rosenthal MS']",['Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical Scholars Program and.'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20140217,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Health Services Needs and Demand/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*therapy', '*Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', '*Needs Assessment/statistics & numerical data']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['care coordination', 'family-centered care', 'health care delivery', 'medical home', 'mental health']",2014/02/19 06:00,2014/04/30 06:00,['2014/02/19 06:00'],"['2014/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2013-2590 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2013-2590 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2014 Mar;133(3):e530-7. doi: 10.1542/peds.2013-2590.

METHODS: Survey logistic regression procedures were used to investigate the association between activity-limiting mental health conditions in mothers and ADHD in their school-aged children using 1998 National Health Interview Survey data. A total of 9529 mother-child dyads were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of ADHD among children aged 4 to 17 years was 6.3%. Survey logistic regression statistics revealed an association between an activity-limiting depression, anxiety, or emotional problem in mothers and ADHD in their children. This association persisted after controlling for the gender, age, and race of the child; household income (as a function of the 1997 poverty level); and type of family structure as reported by the mother (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 4.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.2-8.1). Mothers of a child with ADHD were 13 times more likely to have consulted with a mental health professional about their child's health within the past year despite reporting an inability to afford prescription medications (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 2.2-4.9) and mental health care (OR: 7.4; 95% CI: 4.6, 11.8) for the child. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal mental health is significantly associated with the presence of ADHD in school-aged children. This finding further supports a link between maternal mental health and behavioral outcomes in children. Health care utilization and access findings support a family-oriented system of care.","['Lesesne, Catherine A', 'Visser, Susanna N', 'White, Carla P']","['Lesesne CA', 'Visser SN', 'White CP']","['National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia 30333, USA. clesesne@cdc.gov']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Mental Health Services/economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Mothers/*psychology', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,,2003/05/03 05:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2003/05/03 05:00'],"['2003/05/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/03 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pediatrics. 2003 May;111(5 Pt 2):1232-7.,5 Pt 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: The current study aimed to explore the associations of patients' socio-demographic characteristics with pathways to first contact and duration of untreated mental illness. METHOD: A total of 402 participants were recruited through convenience sampling. A pathway to care form was used to gather systematic information about the sources of care utilized by participants before approaching a mental health professional. Data were analysed using multinomial logistic regression and multiple linear regression models to assess the associations. RESULTS: Majority of participants reported primary care (36.0%) as their first point of contact, followed by non-formal sources of help (33.8%), specialist care (21.8%), police/court (4.0%), websites/media (3.3%) and religious/traditional treatment (1.3%). Those belonging to Malay and Indian ethnicity (vs Chinese) were more likely to make first contact with non-formal sources of help than primary care. Those who received a diagnosis of any mood or anxiety disorder (vs schizophrenia and related psychoses) were less likely to make first contact with specialist care or non-formal sources of help than primary care. Those who were separated/divorced/widowed were significantly associated with higher duration of untreated illness compared to those who were single. Participants whose family/relative initiated the first contact were significantly associated with a shorter duration of untreated illness compared to those who initiated first contact on their own. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest the determinants of the pathways to first contact and duration of untreated illness included diagnosis, ethnicity, marital status and family initiating the first contact. The pathways adopted by these participants need to be kept in mind for planning mental health programmes.","['Jeyagurunathan, Anitha', 'Abdin, Edimansyah', 'Shafie, Saleha', 'Wang, Peizhi', 'Chang, Sherilyn', 'Ong, Hui Lin', 'Abdul Rahman, Restria Fauziana', 'Sagayadevan, Vathsala', 'Samari, Ellaisha', 'Chua, Yi Chian', 'Vaingankar, Janhavi Ajit', 'Verma, Swapna Kamal', 'Wei, Ker-Chiah', 'Chong, Siow Ann', 'Subramaniam, Mythily']","['Jeyagurunathan A', 'Abdin E', 'Shafie S', 'Wang P', 'Chang S', 'Ong HL', 'Abdul Rahman RF', 'Sagayadevan V', 'Samari E', 'Chua YC', 'Vaingankar JA', 'Verma SK', 'Wei KC', 'Chong SA', 'Subramaniam M']","['1 Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.', '1 Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.', '1 Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.', '1 Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.', '1 Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.', '1 Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.', '1 Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.', '1 Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.', '1 Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.', '1 Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.', '1 Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.', '2 Early Psychosis Intervention Programme (EPIP) & General Psychiatry (GP1), Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.', '3 Community Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.', '1 Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.', '1 Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180627,England,Int J Soc Psychiatry,The International journal of social psychiatry,0374726,IM,"['Adult', 'Cultural Diversity', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mental Disorders/ethnology/psychology/therapy', 'Mental Health/ethnology/statistics & numerical data', 'Mental Health Services/*organization & administration', 'Middle Aged', 'Needs Assessment', '*Outpatients/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*psychology', 'Singapore/epidemiology', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Tertiary Healthcare/methods', 'Time-to-Treatment']",PMC6116080,,['NOTNLM'],"['Pathways', 'duration of untreated illness', 'first contact', 'mental illness']",2018/06/28 06:00,2018/12/24 06:00,['2018/06/28 06:00'],"['2018/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1177_0020764018784632 [pii]', '10.1177/0020764018784632 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Soc Psychiatry. 2018 Sep;64(6):554-562. doi: 10.1177/0020764018784632.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed. The sample consisted of individuals aged 65 years or more (389 men and 609 women) who took part in the Household Health Survey of Barcelona in 2000. Mental health was screened through the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). A descriptive analysis, as well as bivariate and multivariate analyses (logistic regression), were performed to analyze the association between mental disorders and social network and social support, adjusted by perceived health status and disabilities. RESULTS: According to the GHQ-12, 21.8% of the women and 9.4% of the men had some mental disorder. Multivariate analysis showed that among men mental disorders were associated with not seeing friends regularly in the subgroup aged 75 years or more (OR = 5.76; 95% CI = 1.77-18.7) and with low social support according to Duke's profile and lack of emotional support in both age groups (65-74 years and 75 years or more). For women, mental disorders were associated with not seeing friends regularly in the subgroup aged 75 years or more and with low social support according to the Duke's profile in both age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health in the elderly population in Barcelona is associated with social network and support. Policies to promote social support could improve mental health in this population.","['Lahuerta, Carol', 'Borrell, Carme', 'Rodriguez-Sanz, Maica', 'Perez, Katherine', 'Nebot, Manel']","['Lahuerta C', 'Borrell C', 'Rodriguez-Sanz M', 'Perez K', 'Nebot M']","['Agencia de Salut Publica de Barcelona, Spain.']",['spa'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Spain,Gac Sanit,Gaceta sanitaria,8901623,IM,"['Aged/*psychology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Geriatrics', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', '*Social Support', 'Spain']",,,,,2004/04/24 05:00,2004/05/27 05:00,['2004/04/24 05:00'],"['2004/04/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['13059278 [pii]', '10.1016/s0213-9111(04)71812-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Gac Sanit. 2004 Mar-Apr;18(2):83-91. doi: 10.1016/s0213-9111(04)71812-9.,2,,,,,La influencia de la red social en la salud mental de la poblacion anciana.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By dealing with such heterogeneity through a systematic review and meta-analysis, we examine the association between income inequality, mental health problems, use of mental health services, and resilience (defined as the ability to cope with adversity). METHODS: We searched the Global Health, PsychARTICLES, PsycINFO, Social Policy and Practice, Embase and MEDLINE databases up to July 6, 2016, for quantitative studies of the association of income inequality with prevalence or incidence of mental disorders or mental health problems, use of mental health services, and resilience. Eligible studies used standardised instruments at the individual level, and income inequality at the aggregated, contextual, and ecological level. We extracted study characteristics, sampling, exposure, outcomes, statistical modelling, and parameters from articles. Because several studies did not provide enough statistical information to be included in a meta-analysis, we did a narrative synthesis to summarise results with studies categorised as showing either a positive association, mixed results, or no association. The primary outcome in the random-effects meta-analysis was mental health-related morbidity, defined as the prevalence or incidence of any mental health problem. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016036377. FINDINGS: Our search identified 15 615 non-duplicate references, of which 113 were deemed potentially relevant and were assessed for eligibility, leading to the inclusion of 27 studies in the qualitative synthesis. Nine articles found a positive association between income inequality and the prevalence or incidence of mental health problems; ten articles found mixed results, with positive association in some subgroups and non-significant or negative association in other subgroups; and eight articles found no association between income inequality and mental health problems. Of the nine articles included in our meta-analysis, one reported a positive association between income inequality and mental health problems, six reported mixed results, and two reported no association. Pooled Cohen's d effect sizes for the association between income inequality and any mental disorder or mental health problems were 0.06 (95% CI 0.01-0.11) for any mental disorder, and 0.12 (0.05-0.20) for depressive disorders. Our meta-regression analysis showed that none of the factors considered (sample size, contextual level at which income inequality was assessed, quality assessment, type of instruments, and individual income as control variable) explained heterogeneity between studies (I(2) 89.3%; p<0.0001). Only one study investigated the association between income inequality and resilience; it found greater income inequality was associated with higher prevalence of depression only among individuals with low income. The only study of the role of income inequality as a determinant of the use of mental health services reported no association. INTERPRETATION: Income inequality negatively affects mental health but the effect sizes are small and there is marked heterogeneity among studies. If this association is causal and growing income inequality does lead to an increase in the prevalence of mental health problems, then its reduction could result in a significant improvement in population wellbeing.

This negligence is an industry-wide failure to address aid workers' psychological health issues. The suspected numbers of death by suicide, diagnosed PTSD, depression, anxiety disorders, hazardous alcohol and drug consumption, emotional exhaustion, and other stress-related problems are impossible to quantify but are considered endemic. Tools for establishing organizational frameworks for mental health and psychosocial support are readily available. However, the capacity to implement this assistance requires the creation and practice of an open and non-judgmental culture, based on the realistic acceptance that aid work has become inherently dangerous. The possibility of developing a psychological problem because of aid work has increased along with the rise in levels of disease, injury, kidnapping, and assault. As a result, expressions of traumatic stress have become the norm rather than an exception. This commentary outlines the essential steps and components necessary to meet these requirements.","['Macpherson, Robert I S', 'Burkle, Frederick M']","['Macpherson RIS', 'Burkle FM']","['Unaffiliated Researcher, Charlotte, North CarolinaUSA.', 'Professor (Ret.), Senior Fellow & Scientist, Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, Harvard University & T.H.

However, it has largely been investigated in relation to specific disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. Few studies have assessed the relationship between death anxiety and psychopathology using heterogeneous treatment-seeking clinical samples. METHODS: In the present study, the relationships between death anxiety and broad markers of psychopathology were explored in 200 treatment-seeking participants with various diagnosed mental disorders. RESULTS: Across the sample, death anxiety was a strong predictor of psychopathology, including the number of lifetime diagnoses, medications, hospitalizations, distress/impairment, depression, anxiety, and stress. This relationship was not accounted for by neuroticism. Large to very large correlations were also consistently found between a measure of death anxiety and the symptom severity of 12 disorders. Neither meaning in life nor attachment style moderated the associations between death fears and psychopathology. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reveal a strong relationship between death anxiety and psychopathology across numerous disorders, further supporting the transdiagnostic role of fears of death. As such, clinical implications revolve around the potential need for innovative treatments which address death fears directly, in order to produce long-term improvements in mental health. However, experimental research is needed to ascertain causal relationships. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Across a large treatment-seeking sample, death anxiety was a significant predictor of broad psychopathology, including distress and number of lifetime diagnoses. Across 12 different disorders, death anxiety significantly predicted symptom severity. Results may suggest the need for novel treatments which specifically target fears of death. Due to the correlational design, future experimental research is needed to establish causal relationships with increased confidence.","['Menzies, Rachel E', 'Sharpe, Louise', 'Dar-Nimrod, Ilan']","['Menzies RE', 'Sharpe L', 'Dar-Nimrod I']","['The University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190718,England,Br J Clin Psychol,The British journal of clinical psychology,8105533,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anxiety/*psychology', '*Death', 'Fear/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*trends', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['death anxiety', 'fear of death', 'psychopathology', 'transdiagnostic']",2019/07/19 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjc.12229 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Psychol. 2019 Nov;58(4):452-467. doi: 10.1111/bjc.12229.

We examined the association between pre-migration and post-migration potentially traumatic events and stressors and mental health, and assessed the moderating effect of post-migration stressors in humanitarian migrants in Australia. METHODS: In this study, we used the first wave of data between 2013 and 2014 from the Building a New Life in Australia survey. The survey included 2399 migrants who had arrived in Australia holding a permanent humanitarian visa 3-6 months preceding the survey, with 77% and 23% of participants being granted visas through offshore and onshore humanitarian programmes, respectively. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was measured with the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder 8 items (PTSD-8) and severe mental illness was measured with the Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K6). Pre-migration potentially traumatic events and post-migration stressors related to asylum process and resettlement were measured with a self-reported questionnaire. FINDINGS: Of the 2399 participants, 762 (31%; 95% CI 29.4-33.2) had PTSD and 394 (16%; 95% CI 14.2-17.2) had severe mental illness. The mean number of pre-migration potentially traumatic events was 2.1 (SD 1.4). 64%, 59%, 49%, and 18% of participants reported poor social integration, economic problems, worrying about family or friends overseas, and loneliness as post-migration stressors. Pre-migration potentially traumatic events and post-migration stressors were positively associated with PTSD and severe mental illness. Factors significantly modifying the association between pre-migration potentially traumatic events and mental health after controlling for confounding factors were resettlement related stressors, including loneliness (odds ratio 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.28 for PTSD and 1.28, 1.16-1.41 for severe mental illness) and the number of social integration stressors (1.10, 1.05-1.16 for PTSD). INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that post-migration resettlement-related stressors were the most important correlates of mental health in humanitarian migrants, accounting for both direct and indirect associations. Targeting resettlement-related stressors through augmenting psychosocial care programmes and social integration would be a key approach to improve humanitarian migrants' mental health.

The potential role of cultural values in cross-national variability of mental disorders' prevalence.,756-766,10.1177/0020764018811361 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Mental disorders may show inherent cross-national variability in their prevalence. A considerable number of meta-analyses attribute this heterogeneity to the methodological diversity in published epidemiological studies. Cultural values are characteristically not assessed in meta-regression models as potential covariates. AIM: Our aim was to conduct a meta-regression analysis to explore to what extent certain cultural values and immigration rates (as indicator of cultural diversity) might be associated with the cross-national heterogeneity of prevalence rates. METHOD: To minimize methodological differences that may exert a confounding effect, prevalence rates were obtained from the World Health Organization's (WHO) World Mental Health Survey Initiative. Cultural indices (overall emancipative values; overall secular values) were collected from the World Value Survey, while immigration rates were registered by utilizing the data of the United Nations' World Population Policies 2005 report. RESULTS: Meta-regression analysis indicated that overall emancipative values (i.e. promoting self-expression, non-violent protest) showed significant connection with lifetime and last year prevalence of any mood disorders (Z = 4.71, p = .001; Z = 2.35, p = .02) and any internalizing disorders (a merged category that combined mood and anxiety disorders; Z = 2.82, p = .004; Z = 2.34, p = .02). Overall secular values (i.e. rejecting authority and obedience) were negatively associated with last year prevalence of depression (Z = -2.75, p = .06). Multistep regression analysis indicated that immigration rate moderated the connection between cultural values and mental disorders. Countries with higher immigration rates showed higher emancipative and secular values. CONCLUSION: Our findings might function as potential foundation for formulating hypotheses regarding the cultural context's influence on the population's mental health.","['Kapitany-Foveny, Mate', 'Richman, Mara J', 'Demetrovics, Zsolt', 'Sulyok, Mihaly']","['Kapitany-Foveny M', 'Richman MJ', 'Demetrovics Z', 'Sulyok M']","['Faculty of Health Sciences, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Nyiro Gyula Hospital Drug Outpatient and Prevention Center, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Institute of Psychology, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Institute of Psychology, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Neurology and Stroke, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181111,England,Int J Soc Psychiatry,The International journal of social psychiatry,0374726,IM,"['Adult', 'Cross-Cultural Comparison', '*Cultural Diversity', '*Emigrants and Immigrants/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Global Health/ethnology/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology/psychology', '*Mental Health/ethnology/statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', 'Psychopathology', 'Social Values/*ethnology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mental disorder prevalence', 'WMH', 'cultural values', 'depression', 'immigration rate']",2018/11/13 06:00,2020/06/13 06:00,['2018/11/13 06:00'],"['2018/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0020764018811361 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Soc Psychiatry. 2018 Dec;64(8):756-766. doi: 10.1177/0020764018811361.

METHODS: The Singapore Mental Health Study was a cross-sectional epidemiological survey of a nationally representative sample of residents aged 18 years or older. Diagnosis of mental disorders was established using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview; while chronic physical conditions were established using a checklist. Days out of role were assessed using a WHO Disability Assessment Schedule item. Multivariate regression analyses were used to estimate individual-level and societal-level effects of disorders. RESULTS: Overall, 8.7% of respondents reported at least one day out of role, with a mean of 5.8 days. The most disabling conditions at the individual level were cancer (118.9 additional days), cardiovascular diseases (93.5), and bipolar disorder (71.0). At the societal level, cardiovascular diseases contributed the highest population attributable risk proportion (45%), followed by cancer (39.3%), and hypertension (13.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Mental and physical conditions are linked to significant losses in productivity for society as well as role disability for individuals, underscoring the need to enhance prevention and intervention efforts to increase overall productivity and improve individual functioning.","['Abdin, Edimansyah', 'Ong, Clarissa', 'Chong, Siow Ann', 'Vaingankar, Janhavi Ajit', 'Subramaniam, Mythily']","['Abdin E', 'Ong C', 'Chong SA', 'Vaingankar JA', 'Subramaniam M']","['Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160203,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chronic Disease/economics/*epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Disabled Persons/statistics & numerical data', 'Disease/*economics', 'Efficiency', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/diagnosis/economics/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Sick Leave/economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Singapore/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC4739696,,,,2016/02/04 06:00,2016/07/28 06:00,['2016/02/04 06:00'],"['2015/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-15-20324 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0148248 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Feb 3;11(2):e0148248. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0148248. eCollection 2016.,2,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: The design of this study is cross-sectional comparisons of population survey outcomes. METHODS: Canadian national population data from 2007 to 2016 (T1 N = 14,223; T2 N = 14,247; T3 N = 13,532; T4 N = 13,184; T5 N = 11,122; Total N = 66,308) were examined to find trends in health diagnosis (chronic illnesses and mental disorders) and healthcare consultation (general health practitioners and mental health professionals). Controlling demographics, Multivariate analysis of covariances (MANCOVAs) and correlations were carried out to compare differences by age group (A1: 12-14 years N = 25,180; A2: 15-17 years N = 25,825; A3: 18-19 years N = 15,303) and gender (girls N = 32,388; boys N = 33,920) across survey years. RESULTS: Steady increases were found in diagnosed mental disorders and consultations with a mental health professional (MP) for girls, while chronic illnesses remained stable and general practitioner consultations declined for all adolescents over these years. Gender disparity in MP consultations grew with age, much more in recent years, whereas chronic illness diagnoses curved down for all in midadolescence. More integrated relations between health status and healthcare utilization were noted in T5 than in T1. CONCLUSIONS: Differential secular trends were shown for adolescent physical versus mental health statuses and relevant healthcare consultations. Although girls' and older adolescents' mental health declined over the years, a positive direction was also found for improved awareness of mental health.","['Kwak, K']",['Kwak K'],"['School of Law and Social Sciences, University of East London, London, E15 1NF, United Kingdom.

Current treatments prioritise lifestyle interventions, predominantly diet and exercise management, but patients frequently fail to make the necessary behavioural adjustments. The current study seeks to identify those factors which influence patients' behaviour with respect to adherence to treatment regimes. METHODS: Novel areas of interest were investigated; locus of control, behavioural regulation and a range of mental health measures, due to their links to either poor lifestyle choices or abnormal eating as identified in previous literature. Data was gathered using self-report questionnaires, from 96 participants, who were split into three groups, NAFLD patients, non-NAFLD liver disease patients and healthy controls RESULTS: Data was analysed using a MANOVA, and followed up with a Tukey post-hoc test. Three factors were found to be significant by group; cognitive restraint, uncontrolled eating and SAPAS score (a measure of personality disorders). An association between personality disorders and NAFLD was identified. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that NAFLD patients are screened for personality disorders and, if identified, treated prior to the commencement of diet and exercise management.","['Asquith, E', 'Bould, K', 'Catling, J C', 'Day, E J', 'Holt, A']","['Asquith E', 'Bould K', 'Catling JC', 'Day EJ', 'Holt A']","['School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.

However, they have the highest mortality across the spectrum of mental health, with high rates of medical complications and risk, ranging from hypoglycaemia and electrolyte disturbances to cardiac abnormalities. People with eating disorders may not disclose their diagnosis when they see healthcare professionals. This can be due to denial of the condition itself, a wish to avoid treatment for a condition which may be valued, or because of the stigma attached to mental health. As a result their diagnosis can be easily missed by healthcare professionals and thus the prevalence is underappreciated. This article presents eating disorders to emergency and acute medicine practitioners from a new perspective using the combined emergency, psychiatric, nutrition and psychology lens. It focuses on the most serious acute pathology which can develop from the more common presentations; highlights indicators of hidden disease; discusses screening; suggests key acute management considerations and explores the challenge of mental capacity in a group of high-risk patients who, with the right treatment, can make a good recovery.","['Jafar, Anisa Jabeen Nasir', 'Jafar, Wisam Jalal Jawad', 'Everitt, Emma Kathleen', 'Gill, Ian', 'Sait, Hannah Maria', 'Tan, Jacinta']","['Jafar AJN', 'Jafar WJJ', 'Everitt EK', 'Gill I', 'Sait HM', 'Tan J']","['The University of Manchester Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Royal Infirmary Department of Emergency Medicine, Manchester, UK.', 'Stockport NHS Foundation Trust Gastroenterology Service, Stockport, UK.', 'Manchester Royal Infirmary Department of Emergency Medicine, Manchester, UK.', 'Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.', 'Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, Stockport, UK.', 'Child and Adolescent Eating Disorders Service (CAEDS), Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Welsh Government Eating Disorder Service Review lead, Scottish Government Eating Disorder Service Review co-lead, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, Newport, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Postgrad Med J,Postgraduate medical journal,0234135,IM,"['Humans', '*Feeding and Eating Disorders', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Health Personnel', '*Hypoglycemia', 'Mental Health']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['accident & emergency medicine', 'eating disorders', 'mental health', 'nutritional support']",2023/05/24 06:42,2023/05/25 06:42,['2023/05/24 04:03'],"['2021/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/05/25 06:42 [medline]', '2023/05/24 06:42 [pubmed]', '2023/05/24 04:03 [entrez]']","['7177360 [pii]', '10.1136/postgradmedj-2021-140253 [doi]']",ppublish,Postgrad Med J. 2023 May 19;99(1169):101-111. doi: 10.1136/postgradmedj-2021-140253.,1169,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9262-1450'],,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

METHODS: Sixty-two refugees from Burma were assessed soon after arriving in Australia. All participants received standard interventions provided by a resettlement organisation which included therapeutic interventions, assessment, social assistance, and referrals where appropriate. At the completion of service provision a follow-up assessment was conducted. RESULTS: Over the course of the intervention, participants experienced a significant decrease in symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression and somatisation. Pre-intervention symptoms predicted symptoms post-intervention for post-traumatic stress, anxiety and somatisation. Post-migration living difficulties, the number of traumas experienced, and the number of contacts with the service agency were unrelated to all mental health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In the first Australian study of its kind, reductions in mental health symptoms post-intervention were significantly linked to pre-intervention symptomatology and the number of therapy sessions predicted post-intervention symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Future studies need to include larger samples and control groups to verify findings.","['van Wyk, Sierra', 'Schweitzer, Robert', 'Brough, Mark', 'Vromans, Lyn', 'Murray, Kate']","['van Wyk S', 'Schweitzer R', 'Brough M', 'Vromans L', 'Murray K']","['1School of Psychology and Counselling, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],"['U54 CA132379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA132384/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54CA132379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54CA132384/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120319,England,Aust N Z J Psychiatry,The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,0111052,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Australia', 'Checklist', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology/therapy', '*Mental Health/ethnology/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Myanmar/ethnology', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Refugees/*psychology', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3773081,['NIHMS505541'],,,2012/03/21 06:00,2013/04/09 06:00,['2012/03/21 06:00'],"['2012/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['0004867412443059 [pii]', '10.1177/0004867412443059 [doi]']",ppublish,Aust N Z J Psychiatry. 2012 Oct;46(10):995-1003. doi: 10.1177/0004867412443059.

CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION OF PUBLISHED STUDIES: Studies were chosen to illustrate the development of four major hypotheses regarding the relationship between unemployment and ill health, as well as the present state of knowledge. The review therefore includes some much-cited ""classics"" drawn from a long time span. Where recent reviews already exist relevant to individual mechanisms, these are referred to. Recent (since 1987) reports were sought by searching the BIDS data base. Particular effort was made to locate studies which enabled alternative hypotheses to be evaluated, and to point out where existing evidence is inconsistent or incomplete, indicating the need for further research. CONCLUSIONS: To understand the relationship between unemployment and ill health and mortality, four mechanisms need to be considered: the role of relative poverty; social isolation and loss of self esteem; health related behaviour (including that associated with membership of certain types of ""subculture""); and the effect that a spell of unemployment has on subsequent employment patterns.","['Bartley, M']",['Bartley M'],"['Nuffield College, Oxford.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,IM,"['Cause of Death', 'Disease/psychology', 'Health Behavior', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Life Change Events', 'Male', '*Mental Health', 'Poverty', 'Unemployment/*psychology']",PMC1059979,,,,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jech.48.4.333 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1994 Aug;48(4):333-7. doi: 10.1136/jech.48.4.333.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, there are no systematic reviews examining the global prevalence of personality disorders. AIMS: To calculate the worldwide prevalence of personality disorders and examine whether rates vary between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHOD: We systematically searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed from January 1980 to May 2018 to identify articles reporting personality disorder prevalence rates in community populations (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017065094). RESULTS: A total of 46 studies (from 21 different countries spanning 6 continents) satisfied inclusion criteria. The worldwide pooled prevalence of any personality disorder was 7.8% (95% CI 6.1-9.5). Rates were greater in high-income countries (9.6%, 95% CI 7.9-11.3%) compared with LMICs (4.3%, 95% CI 2.6-6.1%). In univariate meta-regressions, significant heterogeneity was partly attributable to study design (two-stage v. one-stage assessment), county income (high-income countries v. LMICs) and interview administration (clinician v. trained graduate). In multiple meta-regression analysis, study design remained a significant predictor of heterogeneity. Global rates of cluster A, B and C personality disorders were 3.8% (95% CI 3.2, 4.4%), 2.8% (1.6, 3.7%) and 5.0% (4.2, 5.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Personality disorders are prevalent globally. Nevertheless, pooled prevalence rates should be interpreted with caution due to high levels of heterogeneity. More large-scale studies with standardised methodologies are now needed to increase our understanding of population needs and regional variations.","['Winsper, Catherine', 'Bilgin, Ayten', 'Thompson, Andrew', 'Marwaha, Steven', 'Chanen, Andrew M', 'Singh, Swaran P', 'Wang, Ariel', 'Furtado, Vivek']","['Winsper C', 'Bilgin A', 'Thompson A', 'Marwaha S', 'Chanen AM', 'Singh SP', 'Wang A', 'Furtado V']","['Grant Writer and Honorary Research Fellow, Centre for Mental Health and Wellbeing Research, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick; and Research and Innovation Department, Caludon Centre, Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust, UK.', 'Psychology Department, Istanbul Medeniyet University, Turkey.', 'Principal Research Fellow, Orygen, The National Centre of Excellence in Youth Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Australia; and Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, UK.', 'Professor of Psychiatry, Institute for Mental Health, Birmingham University; and the Barberry, National Centre for Mental Health, UK.', 'Professorial Fellow and Head of Personality Disorder Research, Orygen, The National Centre of Excellence in Youth Mental Health; and Centre for Youth Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Australia.', 'Professor and Director of the Centre for Mental Health and Wellbeing Research, Centre for Mental Health and Wellbeing Research, University of Warwick, UK.', 'PhD student, Division of Mental Health and Wellbeing, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, UK.', 'Associate Clinical Professor of Forensic Psychiatry, Division of Mental Health and Wellbeing, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",,England,Br J Psychiatry,The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,0342367,IM,"['Developed Countries/economics', 'Developing Countries/economics', 'Humans', 'Income', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Personality Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['LMIC', 'Personality disorder', 'meta-analysis', 'prevalence', 'systematic review']",2019/07/13 06:00,2021/04/02 06:00,['2019/07/13 06:00'],"['2019/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0007125019001661 [pii]', '10.1192/bjp.2019.166 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Psychiatry. 2020 Feb;216(2):69-78. doi: 10.1192/bjp.2019.166.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is a need in practice to link the assessment to nursing interventions in a meaningful way. This paper proposes that the clinical formulation can be regarded as central to providing this cohesion. The formulation does not merely organize the assessment findings but is also an interpretation or explanation, made in consultation with the client, of what meaning can be attributed to the issues explored in the assessment process. Because this interpretation is dependent on both the client's and the nurse's explanatory frameworks, there are multiple ways of developing the formulation. It is also an evolving and dynamic statement of understanding. A case example is provided in the paper to illustrate how the same case can be interpreted in different ways and the implications this has for the nursing interventions provided.","['Crowe, M', 'Carlyle, D', 'Farmar, R']","['Crowe M', 'Carlyle D', 'Farmar R']","['Centre for Postgraduate Nursing Studies, Department of Psychological Medicine, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand. marie.crowe@otago.ac.nz']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs,Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing,9439514,,"['Bipolar Disorder/nursing', 'Depressive Disorder/nursing', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/diagnosis/*nursing', '*Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Nurse-Patient Relations', 'Nursing Process', '*Psychiatric Nursing', 'Psychotherapy']",,,,,2008/11/18 09:00,2009/02/14 09:00,['2008/11/18 09:00'],"['2008/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['JPM1307 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2850.2008.01307.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs. 2008 Dec;15(10):800-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2850.2008.01307.x.,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a cultural focus, the goal of this investigation was to examine ethnic variations both in the prevalence of common mental disorder (CMD) symptoms as well as in the associations between sociodemographic, psychosocial, physical health correlates and CMDs among mothers in Trinidad and Tobago. Participants included 1002 mothers (359 African-, 353 Indo- and 290 Mixed-Ethnic Trinidadian). Mean comparisons indicated similarities in the levels of depression, somatisation and anxiety across ethnic groups. The associations between physical ill health, experiences of pain and depression and between physical ill health and somatisation were stronger for Mixed-Ethnic Trinidadian than Indo-Trinidadian mothers. The relationship between early experiences of domestic violence and depression was stronger for Indo-Trinidadian than Mixed-Ethnic Trinidadian mothers. The associations between early experiences of domestic violence and depression and between experiences of pain and somatisation were stronger for African Trinidadian than Mixed-Ethnic Trinidadian mothers. Thus beyond the direct effects, mothers belonging to specific ethnic groups indicated greater or lesser vulnerabilities to CMDs depending on their exposure to specific correlates. Results have applicability for the development of culturally sensitive interventions for mothers experiencing CMDs.","['Krishnakumar, Ambika', 'Narine, Lutchmie', 'Roopnarine, Jaipaul L', 'Logie, Carol']","['Krishnakumar A', 'Narine L', 'Roopnarine JL', 'Logie C']","['Department of Child and Family Studies, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA.', 'Department of Public Health, Food Studies and Nutrition, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA.', 'Department of Child and Family Studies, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA.', ""Family Development and Children's Research Centre (FDCRC), The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160822,England,Int J Psychol,International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie,0107305,IM,"['Adult', 'Ethnicity/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*ethnology/trends', 'Mothers', 'Prevalence', 'Trinidad and Tobago']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Common mental disorder symptoms', 'Correlates', 'Ethnicity', 'Mothers', 'Trinidad and Tobago']",2016/08/24 06:00,2018/08/15 06:00,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2015/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijop.12383 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Psychol. 2018 Aug;53(4):304-312. doi: 10.1002/ijop.12383.

It is also largely unknown whether boys and girls with ADHD differ in their sleep functioning. This study (1) examined whether boys or girls with ADHD differ in their sleep functioning, (2) evaluated comorbid symptoms as uniquely related to sleep functioning domains, and (3) explored whether sex moderated associations between comorbid symptoms and sleep. Participants were 181 children (ages 7-13; 69% male; 82% White) diagnosed with ADHD. Parents completed measures assessing their child's ADHD symptoms, comorbid symptoms, and sleep functioning. Girls had poorer sleep functioning than boys across most sleep functioning domains. Sixty percent of children met cutoff criteria for having sleep problems, though rates differed significantly between girls (75%) and boys (53%). No differences in rates of sleep problems were found between ADHD subtypes/presentations or between younger and older children. In path models including ADHD and comorbid symptom dimensions, anxiety symptoms were uniquely associated with increased bedtime resistance and sleep anxiety, ADHD hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were associated with more night wakings and more parasomnia behaviors, and ODD and depressive symptoms were associated with shorter sleep duration. Depression was also uniquely associated with increased daytime sleepiness and overall sleep problems. Sex did not moderate associations between comorbid symptoms and sleep problems. This study provides important preliminary evidence that girls with ADHD experience more sleep problems than boys with ADHD. Findings also demonstrate that the associations between comorbid symptoms and sleep functioning in children with ADHD vary based on both the specific symptoms and sleep domains examined.","['Becker, Stephen P', 'Cusick, Caroline N', 'Sidol, Craig A', 'Epstein, Jeffery N', 'Tamm, Leanne']","['Becker SP', 'Cusick CN', 'Sidol CA', 'Epstein JN', 'Tamm L']","[""Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet Avenue, MLC 10006, Cincinnati, OH, 45229-3039, USA. stephen.becker@cchmc.org."", 'College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA. stephen.becker@cchmc.org.', ""Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet Avenue, MLC 10006, Cincinnati, OH, 45229-3039, USA."", 'Department of Psychology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', ""Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet Avenue, MLC 10006, Cincinnati, OH, 45229-3039, USA."", 'College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', ""Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet Avenue, MLC 10006, Cincinnati, OH, 45229-3039, USA."", 'College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['K23 MH108603/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', '12.1281/Ohio Department of Mental Health/', 'K23MH108603/National Institute of Mental Health/']",['Journal Article'],20171005,Germany,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,European child & adolescent psychiatry,9212296,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*psychology', 'Child', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*trends', 'Sex Factors', 'Sleep Wake Disorders/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",PMC5854508,['NIHMS911130'],['NOTNLM'],"['Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder', 'Comorbidity', 'Daytime sleepiness', 'Gender', 'Sex differences', 'Sleep']",2017/10/07 06:00,2018/05/19 06:00,['2017/10/07 06:00'],"['2017/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00787-017-1055-2 [pii]', '10.1007/s00787-017-1055-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2018 Mar;27(3):353-365. doi: 10.1007/s00787-017-1055-2.

In response, Argentina promulgated a National Mental Health Law (NMHL, No. 26.657) that was regulated through the Regulatory Decree No. 603/2013 and implemented through the National Mental Health Plan (NMHP). The NMHL defines the vision, values, and principles for improving the mental health system for the country via urging that mental health care be based on scientific evidence adjusted to ethical principles. This is not new in other areas of health; however, it implies a paradigm shift for the mental health system in Argentina.

A recent challenge to the DSM approach to psychiatric nosology from the National Institute on Mental Health (USA) defines Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) as an alternative. For RDoC, psychiatric illnesses are not defined as discrete categories, but instead as specific behavioral dysfunctions irrespective of DSM diagnostic categories. This approach was driven by two primary weaknesses noted in the DSM: (1) the same symptoms occur in very different disease states; and (2) DSM criteria lack grounding in the underlying biological causes of mental illness. RDoC intends to ground psychiatric nosology in those underlying mechanisms. This review addresses the suitability of RDoC vs. DSM from the view of modeling mental illness in animals. A consideration of all types of psychiatric dysfunction is beyond the scope of this review, which will focus on models of conditions associated with frontostriatal dysfunction.","['Young, Jared W', 'Winstanley, Catharine A', 'Brady, Anne Marie', 'Hall, Frank Scott']","['Young JW', 'Winstanley CA', 'Brady AM', 'Hall FS']","['Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, 9500 Gilman Dr., MC 0804, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA; Research Service, VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA, USA.

This characteristic makes forums valuable for identifying users in need of immediate help from mental health professionals. Because it would be impractical to manually review every post on a forum to identify users in need of urgent help, there may be value to developing algorithms for automatically detecting posts reflecting a heightened risk of imminent plans to engage in disordered behaviors. METHOD: Five natural language processing techniques (tools to perform computational text analysis) were used on a data set of 4,812 posts obtained from six eating disorder-related subreddits. Two licensed clinical psychologists labeled 53 of these posts, deciding whether or not the content of the post indicated that its author needed immediate professional help. The remaining 4,759 posts were unlabeled. RESULTS: Each of the five techniques ranked the 50 posts most likely to be intervention-worthy (the ""top-50""). The two most accurate detection techniques had an error rate of 4% for their respective top-50. DISCUSSION: This article demonstrates the feasibility of automatically detecting-with only a few dozen labeled examples-the posts of individuals in need of immediate mental health support for an eating disorder.","['Yan, Hao', 'Fitzsimmons-Craft, Ellen E', 'Goodman, Micah', 'Krauss, Melissa', 'Das, Sanmay', 'Cavazos-Rehg, Patricia']","['Yan H', 'Fitzsimmons-Craft EE', 'Goodman M', 'Krauss M', 'Das S', 'Cavazos-Rehg P']","['Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.']",['eng'],"['K02 DA043657/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 MH112331/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R34 MH119170/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190805,United States,Int J Eat Disord,The International journal of eating disorders,8111226,IM,"['Feeding and Eating Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*trends', 'Social Media/*trends']",PMC6790146,['NIHMS1046456'],['NOTNLM'],"['eating disorders', 'machine learning', 'mass screening', 'natural language processing', 'social media']",2019/08/06 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/08/06 06:00'],"['2019/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eat.23148 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Eat Disord. 2019 Oct;52(10):1150-1156. doi: 10.1002/eat.23148.

The aim was to examine the mental health of asylum-seeking parents and children during prolonged immigration detention and to consider the human rights implications of the findings. The average period of detention was seven months. Data includes 166 Kessler 10 Scales (K10) and 70 Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ) for children aged 3-17 and parental concerns about 48 infants. Extremely high rates of mental disorder in adults and children resemble clinical populations. The K10 indicated severe co-morbid depression and anxiety in 83% of adults and 85.7% of teenagers. On the SDQ, 75.7% of children had a high probability of psychiatric disorder, with lower conduct and hyperactivity scores than clinic populations. Sixty-seven percent of parents had concerns about their infant's development. Correlations were not found between time detained or parent/child distress. Multiple human rights breaches are identified, including the right to health. This is further evidence of the profound negative consequences for adults and children of prolonged immigration detention. Methodological limitations demonstrate the practical and ethical obstacles to research with this population and the politicized implications of the findings.","['Mares, Sarah']",['Mares S'],"['Cert Child Psychiatry, MMH is Conjoint Senior Lecturer, School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia and Honorary Fellow, Menzies School of Health Research, Darwin Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Health Hum Rights,Health and human rights,9502498,IM,"['Australia', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Emigrants and Immigrants/*psychology', '*Human Rights', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*diagnosis/epidemiology', '*Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Parents', 'Prisons', 'Refugees/*legislation & jurisprudence/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC5395006,,,,2017/06/01 06:00,2018/05/01 06:00,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['hhr-18-02-219 [pii]'],ppublish,Health Hum Rights. 2016 Dec;18(2):219-232.,2,,,"['Disclosure: The author received a fee for her role as Royal Australian and New', 'Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) Consultant to the 2014 AHRC Inquiry', 'into Children in Immigration Detention (February-April 2014).']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some new ones relate to choice of reference class, situation-specificity of function, common diseases and healthy populations, improvements in population health, the practice of pathologists, ""Cambridge changes"" in health status, and comparative vs. absolute health concepts.

This study aimed to use machine learning to identify and describe clusters of self-report health symptoms and examine their association with probable PTSD, other psychopathology, traumatic deployment exposures, and demographic factors. METHOD: Data were from a large sample of military personnel who deployed to the Middle East (n = 12,566) between 2001 and 2009. Participants completed self-report measures including health symptoms and deployment trauma checklists, and several mental health symptom scales. The data driven machine learning technique of self-organised maps identified health symptom clusters and logistic regression examined their correlates. RESULTS: Two clusters differentiated by number and severity of health symptoms were identified: a small 'high health symptom cluster' (HHSC; n = 366) and a large 'low health symptom cluster' (LHSC; n = 12,200). The HHSC had significantly higher proportions of (Gates et al., 2012 [1]) scaled scores indicative of PTSD (69% compared with 2% of LHSC members), Unwin et al. (1999a) [2] scores on other psychological scales that were indicative of psychopathology, and (Graham et al., n.d. [3]) deployment trauma. HHSC members with probable PTSD had a stronger relationship with subjective (OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.12, 1.40) and environmental (OR 1.08; 95% CI 1.03, 1.13) traumatic deployment exposures than LHSC members with probable PTSD. CONCLUSION: These findings highlights that health symptoms are not rare in military veterans, and that PTSD is strongly associated with health symptoms. Results suggest that there may be subtypes of PTSD, differentiated by health symptoms.","['Graham, Kristin', 'Dipnall, Joanna', 'Van Hooff, Miranda', 'Lawrence-Wood, Ellie', 'Searle, Amelia', 'Ao, Alexander McFarlane']","['Graham K', 'Dipnall J', 'Van Hooff M', 'Lawrence-Wood E', 'Searle A', 'Ao AM']","['Centre for Traumatic Stress studies, The University of Adelaide, Level 1/30 Frome Rd, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.

Little is known about changes in depression over time in Germany, although health insurance companies report frequency increases. Here we examined time trends in depression prevalence, severity and health-related correlates in the general population. METHODS: Data were obtained from the mental health module of the ""German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults"" (2009-2012, n = 3265) and the mental health supplement of the ""German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998"" (1997-1999, n = 4176), excluding respondents older than 65. 12-month major depressive disorder (MDD), severity and symptoms were assessed based on the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Health-related quality of life (SF-36), self-reported sick days or days with limitations in normal daily life activities were examined, too. Calculations were carried out population-weighted. Additional age-standardized analyses were conducted to account for demographic changes. RESULTS: Overall, MDD 12-month prevalence remained stable at 7.4%. Women showed a shifted age distribution with increased prevalence at younger ages, and increasing MDD severity. Time trends in health-related correlates occurred both in participants with and without MDD. Mental health disability increased over time, particularly among men with MDD, reflected by the mental component score of the SF-36 and days with activity limitation due to mental health problems. Demographic changes had a marginal impact on the time trends. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the ongoing international debate regarding increased depression rates in western countries, we found no increase in overall MDD prevalence in Germany over a long period. In conclusion, increased depression frequencies in national health insurance data and growing health care costs associated with depression are not attributable to overall prevalence changes at a population level. However, shifted age distribution and increased severity among women may reflect a rising depression risk within this specific subgroup, and changes in health-related correlates indicate a growing mental health care need for depression, particularly among men.","['Bretschneider, Julia', 'Janitza, Silke', 'Jacobi, Frank', 'Thom, Julia', 'Hapke, Ulfert', 'Kurth, Tobias', 'Maske, Ulrike E']","['Bretschneider J', 'Janitza S', 'Jacobi F', 'Thom J', 'Hapke U', 'Kurth T', 'Maske UE']","['Unit 26 Mental Health, Department of Epidemiology and Health Monitoring, Robert Koch-Institute, Berlin, Germany.

Experts in culture and mental health have responded to these criticisms by revising the very process of diagnosis for DSM-5. Specifically, the DSM-5 Cultural Issues Subgroup has recommended that concepts of culture be included more prominently in several areas: an introductory chapter on Cultural Aspects of Psychiatric Diagnosis - composed of a conceptual introduction, a revised Outline for Cultural Formulation, a Cultural Formulation Interview that operationalizes this Outline, and a glossary on cultural concepts of distress - as well as material directly related to culture that is incorporated into the description of each disorder. This chapter surveys these recommendations to demonstrate how culture and context interact with psychiatric diagnosis at multiple levels. A greater appreciation of the interplay between culture, context, and biology can help clinicians improve diagnostic and treatment planning.","['Lewis-Fernandez, Roberto', 'Aggarwal, Neil Krishan']","['Lewis-Fernandez R', 'Aggarwal NK']","['Columbia University Department of Psychiatry, New York, N.Y., USA.']",['eng'],['R34 MH073087/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20130625,Switzerland,Adv Psychosom Med,Advances in psychosomatic medicine,0101303,IM,"['*Culture', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dictionaries as Topic', 'Humans', 'Interview, Psychological/methods', '*Mental Disorders/classification/diagnosis/ethnology/psychology', 'Mental Health/*ethnology', 'Mentally Ill Persons/psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Social Adjustment']",PMC4441039,['NIHMS688260'],,,2013/07/03 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['000348725 [pii]', '10.1159/000348725 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Psychosom Med. 2013;33:15-30. doi: 10.1159/000348725.

This longitudinal qualitative study is a one-year follow-up of eight mental health consumers who participated in a series of creative workshops in Brisbane, Australia that aimed to increase participants' capacity and skills in sharing their stories of recovery with others. It also sought to understand successful factors of the creative workshops to inform future workshops. Semi-structured interviews gathered information regarding participants' memories of the workshops and how they had shared their stories with others over the preceding 12 months. Interpretative phenomenological analysis identified that participants' enjoyed being engaged in a range of creative mediums in a group setting; that peer mentor support was highly valued; and that participants' recovery stories had become more positive and were shared more often and openly with others. Overall, participation in the creative workshops had long-lasting benefits for participants with respect to improved confidence and understanding about their illness. Future creative workshops should consider the inclusion of peer mentors with lived experience as a support for participants to reauthor their recovery story.","['Slattery, Maddy', 'Attard, Hayley', 'Stewart, Victoria', 'Roennfeldt, Helena', 'Wheeler, Amanda J']","['Slattery M', 'Attard H', 'Stewart V', 'Roennfeldt H', 'Wheeler AJ']","['School of Human Services and Social Work, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia.', 'School of Human Services and Social Work, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia.', 'School of Human Services and Social Work, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia.', 'School of Human Services and Social Work, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia.', 'School of Human Services and Social Work, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20201203,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Art Therapy/*methods', 'Australia', 'Creativity', 'Education/methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Interview, Psychological/methods', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/psychology/*therapy', 'Mental Health/education/trends', 'Mentors', 'Middle Aged', 'Peer Group', 'Qualitative Research']",PMC7714126,,,,2020/12/04 06:00,2021/01/20 06:00,['2020/12/03 17:15'],"['2020/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/03 17:15 [entrez]', '2020/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-20-08714 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0243284 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Dec 3;15(12):e0243284. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0243284. eCollection 2020.,12,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2892-2288'],,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prospective Analyses of a UK General Population-Based Study.,e0119970,10.1371/journal.pone.0119970 [doi] e0119970,"The direction of the association between mental health and adiposity is poorly understood. Our objective was to empirically examine this link in a UK study. This is a prospective cohort study of 3 388 people (men) aged >/= 18 years at study induction who participated in both the UK Health and Lifestyle Survey at baseline (HALS-1, 1984/1985) and the re-survey (HALS-2, 1991/1992). At both survey examinations, body mass index, waist circumference and self-reported common mental disorder (the 30-item General Health Questionnaire, GHQ) were measured. Logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios (OR) and accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between (1) baseline common mental disorder (QHQ score > 4) and subsequent general and abdominal obesity and (2) baseline general and abdominal obesity and re-survey common mental disorders. After controlling for a range of covariates, participants with common mental disorder at baseline experienced greater odds of subsequently becoming overweight (women, OR: 1.30, 1.03 - 1.64; men, 1.05, 0.81 - 1.38) and obese (women, 1.26, 0.82 - 1.94; men, OR: 2.10, 1.23 - 3.55) than those who were free of common mental disorder. Similarly, having baseline common mental health disorder was also related to a greater risk of developing moderate (1.57, 1.21 - 2.04) and severe (1.48, 1.09 - 2.01) abdominal obesity (women only). Baseline general or abdominal obesity was not associated with the risk of future common mental disorder. These findings of the present study suggest that the direction of association between common mental disorders and adiposity is from common mental disorder to increased future risk of adiposity as opposed to the converse.","['Fezeu, Leopold K', 'Batty, G David', 'Gale, Catharine R', 'Kivimaki, Mika', 'Hercberg, Serge', 'Czernichow, Sebastien']","['Fezeu LK', 'Batty GD', 'Gale CR', 'Kivimaki M', 'Hercberg S', 'Czernichow S']","[""Universite Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite - Equipe de Recherche en Epidemiologie Nutritionnelle (EREN), Centre d'Epidemiologie et Biostatistiques (EPIBIOS), Inserm, Inra, Cnam, Universite Paris 5, Universite Paris 7, Bobigny, France."", 'Medical Research Council Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom; Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, Finland.', ""Universite Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite - Equipe de Recherche en Epidemiologie Nutritionnelle (EREN), Centre d'Epidemiologie et Biostatistiques (EPIBIOS), Inserm, Inra, Cnam, Universite Paris 5, Universite Paris 7, Bobigny, France; Departement de Sante Publique, Hopital Avicenne (AP-HP), Bobigny, France."", 'Department of Nutrition, Ambroise Pare Hospital (AP-HP); University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, Boulogne-Billancourt, France; INSERM, UMS011 Population-based cohort unit, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['MC_UU_12011/2/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12011/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UP_A620_1014/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U147585827/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U147574232/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U147585824/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/K026992/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/K013351/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UP_A620_1015/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0400491/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U147585819/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",['Journal Article'],20150518,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['*Adiposity', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*epidemiology', 'United Kingdom']",PMC4436271,,,,2015/05/21 06:00,2016/04/22 06:00,['2015/05/21 06:00'],"['2014/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-14-11566 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0119970 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 18;10(5):e0119970. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0119970. eCollection 2015.,5,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,"['PLoS One. 2015;10(7):e0134197.

Methods: We identified 674,821 visits for mental health in the 2019 National Emergency Department Sample and classified them by ICD-10 diagnostic group: schizophrenia-spectrum, bipolar, major depressive, anxiety, or other disorders. Racial and ethnic categories were White, Black, Hispanic, or other. Logistic regression models, adjusted for age, sex, insurance status, and medical comorbidities, were used to describe differences in odds of inpatient admission by race/ethnicity and diagnosis. Results: After covariate adjustment, we did not find overall differences in the likelihood of admission between racial/ethnic groups. However, compared to White patients, admission rates were lower for visits by Black patients for bipolar disorder (OR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59-0.84) and major depressive disorder (OR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59-0.83) and lower for Hispanic patients (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.47-0.68) for anxiety disorders. There were no significant racial/ethnic differences in admission rates for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Conclusions: Overall admission rates were comparable for Black and White patients. After covariate adjustment, there were no differences across racial/ethnic groups, though some racial/ethnic differences persisted within diagnostic subsets of mood and anxiety disorders.","['Gao, Y Nina', 'Olfson, Mark']","['Gao YN', 'Olfson M']","['Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Corresponding Author: Y.

Illinois had one of the hardest hit mental health budgets in the country. The massive mental health funding cuts in Illinois, combined with the state's budget impasse, left fewer facilities available to provide treatment and support to those in need. Many of Illinois's most vulnerable populations either had reduced access, or no access to care. Serious spillover effects were felt by emergency rooms, community hospitals, and the criminal justice system. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to examine disparities in Health Related Quality of Life for those with depression after the funding cuts in Illinois. METHODS: Data from the 2017 Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System was analyzed by using multivariate logistic regression models of the Health Related Quality of Life measures for Illinoisans diagnosed with depressive disorders. RESULTS: According to the regression models in this study, disparities exist in HRQOL for Illinoisans with depressive disorders. In all of the HRQOL models, income was associated with a reduction in HRQOL. Additionally, disparities exist in HRQOL for certain age groups and those who are unemployed. Interestingly, the models did not show any racial disparities as anticipated. CONCLUSION: Without the basic policy-level deficiencies addressed, disparities in Health Related Quality of Life for Illinois's most vulnerable populations will continue to exist as will costly economic spillover effects.","['Mazurek, Kathryn', 'Ciesla, James', 'Akakpo, Rexford']","['Mazurek K', 'Ciesla J', 'Akakpo R']","['Department of Health Sciences, College of Health and Human Sciences, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL, 60115, USA. kmazurek@niu.edu.', 'College of Health and Human Services, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH, 43403, USA.', 'Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL, 60115, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200615,England,BMC Public Health,BMC public health,100968562,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Depressive Disorder/*economics/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility/*economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Healthcare Disparities/*economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Illinois/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Health Care/*economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Quality of Life', 'Young Adult']",PMC7296938,,['NOTNLM'],"['BRFSS', 'Depression', 'HRQOL', 'Mental health']",2020/06/17 06:00,2020/11/13 06:00,['2020/06/17 06:00'],"['2020/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12889-020-09041-5 [pii]', '9041 [pii]', '10.1186/s12889-020-09041-5 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Public Health. 2020 Jun 15;20(1):936. doi: 10.1186/s12889-020-09041-5.,1,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8350-1753'],,['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concomitantly, the potential effects of the design on the response behavior of the participants remain largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate the associations between various sample and design characteristics and the compliance and retention rates of studies using ESM in mental health research. METHODS: ESM studies investigating major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorder were considered for inclusion. Besides the compliance and retention rates, a number of sample and design characteristics of the selected studies were collected to assess their potential relationships with the compliance and retention rates. Multilevel random/mixed effects models were used for the analyses. RESULTS: Compliance and retention rates were lower for studies with a higher proportion of male participants (P<.001) and individuals with a psychotic disorder (P<.001). Compliance was positively associated with the use of a fixed sampling scheme (P=.02), higher incentives (P=.03), higher time intervals between successive evaluations (P=.02), and fewer evaluations per day (P=.008), while no significant associations were observed with regard to the mean age of the sample, the study duration, or other design characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that ESM studies can be carried out in mental health research, but the quality of the data collection depends upon a number of factors related to the design of ESM studies and the samples under study that need to be considered when designing such protocols.","['Vachon, Hugo', 'Viechtbauer, Wolfgang', 'Rintala, Aki', 'Myin-Germeys, Inez']","['Vachon H', 'Viechtbauer W', 'Rintala A', 'Myin-Germeys I']","['Center for Contextual Psychiatry, Department of Neurosciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Contextual Psychiatry, Department of Neurosciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands.', 'Center for Contextual Psychiatry, Department of Neurosciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Contextual Psychiatry, Department of Neurosciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20191206,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*trends', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychotic Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Research Design', 'Young Adult']",PMC6925392,,['NOTNLM'],"['compliance', 'ecological momentary assessment', 'experience sampling', 'retention', 'severe mental disorders']",2019/12/07 06:00,2020/07/24 06:00,['2019/12/07 06:00'],"['2019/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['v21i12e14475 [pii]', '10.2196/14475 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2019 Dec 6;21(12):e14475. doi: 10.2196/14475.,12,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1259-649X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3463-4063', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0066-4697', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3731-4930']",,['Conflicts of Interest: None declared.'],"['(c)Hugo Vachon, Wolfgang Viechtbauer, Aki Rintala, Inez Myin-Germeys.

In this review, we discuss recent studies that inform our developing understanding for improving the recovery trajectory for survivors of a critical illness during the postintensive care and posthospital periods. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies, although at this stage often presented as pilot work, provide important beginning messages for improving recovery from a critical illness. Some pilot studies demonstrate promise of effective interventions, whereas other studies offer useful baseline information for improving the power of tested interventions. SUMMARY: Innovative rehabilitation and recovery strategies during the postintensive care and posthospital periods are now being published. Further research with larger sample sizes, well-documented usual care and intervention arms and in different critical illness cohorts is required to demonstrate the optimal approaches for screening, implementation, outcome assessment and follow-up periods for rehabilitation interventions in the postintensive care phase of a patient's recovery.","['Denehy, Linda', 'Elliott, Doug']","['Denehy L', 'Elliott D']","['Department of Physiotherapy, Dentistry and Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Crit Care,Current opinion in critical care,9504454,IM,"['*Continuity of Patient Care', 'Critical Illness/*rehabilitation', 'Exercise Therapy/methods', 'Humans', '*Intensive Care Units', 'Mental Health', 'Muscle Weakness/*etiology', 'Risk', 'Syndrome', 'Time Factors', '*Treatment Outcome']",,,,,2012/08/24 06:00,2013/01/31 06:00,['2012/08/24 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MCC.0b013e328357f064 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Crit Care. 2012 Oct;18(5):503-8. doi: 10.1097/MCC.0b013e328357f064.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous research found that parity significantly lowered average out-of-pocket (OOP) spending on MH/SUD treatment of children. No evidence is available on how parity affects OOP spending by families of children with the highest MH/SUD treatment expenditures. METHODS: We used a difference-in-differences study design to examine whether parity reduced families' (1) share of total MH/SUD treatment expenditures paid OOP or (2) average OOP spending among children whose total MH/SUD expenditures met or exceeded the 90th percentile. By using claims data, we compared changes 2 years before (1999-2000) and 2 years after (2001-2002) the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program implemented parity to a contemporaneous group of health plans that did not implement parity over the same 4-year period. We examined those enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program because their parity directive is similar to and served as a model for the new federal parity law. RESULTS: Parity led to statistically significant annual declines in the share of total MH/SUD treatment expenditures paid OOP (-5%, 95% confidence interval: -6% to -4%) and average OOP spending on MH/SUD treatment (-$178, 95% confidence interval: -257 to -97). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first empirical evidence that parity reduces the share and level of OOP spending by families of children with the highest MH/SUD treatment expenditures; however, these spending reductions were smaller than anticipated and unlikely to meaningfully improve families' financial protection.","['Barry, Colleen L', 'Chien, Alyna T', 'Normand, Sharon-Lise T', 'Busch, Alisa B', 'Azzone, Vanessa', 'Goldman, Howard H', 'Huskamp, Haiden A']","['Barry CL', 'Chien AT', 'Normand SL', 'Busch AB', 'Azzone V', 'Goldman HH', 'Huskamp HA']","['Department of Health Policy and Management, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. cbarry@jhsph.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 MH093414/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01MH054693/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH054693/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 MH071714/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01MH080797/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01MH093414/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'K01MH071714/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA026414/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH080797/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130218,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Health Expenditures/legislation & jurisprudence/trends', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*economics/therapy', 'Mental Health/*economics/legislation & jurisprudence/trends', 'Mental Health Services/*economics/legislation & jurisprudence/trends', 'Substance-Related Disorders/*economics/therapy', 'Young Adult']",PMC3581843,,,,2013/02/20 06:00,2013/05/04 06:00,['2013/02/20 06:00'],"['2013/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2012-1491 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2012-1491 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2013 Mar;131(3):e903-11. doi: 10.1542/peds.2012-1491.

METHODS: A systematic review of published (AMED, CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library) and unpublished research databases (OpenGrey, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Current Controlled Trials, the UK National Research Register Archive) was performed from their inception to January 2013. Studies assessing the prevalence and incidence of psychological conditions for people diagnosed with BJHS were included. Meta-analysis assessing the odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference in severity of psychological conditions was performed. Methodological quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) appraisal tools. RESULTS: Fourteen papers including 3957 participants, 1006 people with and 2951 controls without BJHS were eligible. The overall methodological quality was moderate. The results indicated that people with BJHS experience significantly greater perceptions of fear and more intense fear (P < 0.05) and have a higher probability of demonstrating agoraphobia (P < 0.05), anxiety (OR 4.39, 95% CI 1.92, 10.40), depression (OR 4.10, 95% CI 1.79, 9.41) and panic disorders (OR 6.72, 95% CI 2.22, 20.35) than those without BJHS (P </= 0.005). Neither anxiety nor depression have been assessed in childhood populations. CONCLUSION: People with BJHS commonly exhibit a range of symptoms related to anxiety and depression. Considerable emotional symptoms accompany BJHS. Further study is warranted to explore how these results relate to non-Mediterranean populations and children. However, the data suggest that targeting psychological symptoms could be an important approach to managing the range of symptoms reported in these patients.","['Smith, Toby O', 'Easton, Victoria', 'Bacon, Holly', 'Jerman, Emma', 'Armon, Kate', 'Poland, Fiona', 'Macgregor, Alex J']","['Smith TO', 'Easton V', 'Bacon H', 'Jerman E', 'Armon K', 'Poland F', 'Macgregor AJ']","[""Queen's Building, School of Allied Health Professions, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich NR4 7TJ, UK. toby.smith@uea.ac.uk.""]",['eng'],['PB-PG-0407-13279/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20130929,England,Rheumatology (Oxford),"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",100883501,IM,"['*Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Global Health', 'Humans', '*Joint Instability/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', '*Mental Health', 'Prevalence', '*Risk Assessment', 'Syndrome']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['assessment', 'benign joint hypermobility syndrome', 'mental health', 'panic disorder', 'psychological entity']",2013/10/02 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/10/02 06:00'],"['2013/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ket317 [pii]', '10.1093/rheumatology/ket317 [doi]']",ppublish,Rheumatology (Oxford). 2014 Jan;53(1):114-22. doi: 10.1093/rheumatology/ket317.

Mental disorder such as depression is an important yet often neglected NCD and is becoming a growing cause of disability, suicides, and disease burden. This paper provides the first nationally representative estimate of the medical cost attributable to depression and depressive symptoms among the adult population in China. On the basis of the 2012 China Family Panel Studies survey, our results indicate that these mental health conditions have significant impacts on the individual medical expenditure, and they jointly contribute to 14.7% of total personal expected medical spending in China, with depression and depressive symptoms accounting for 6.9% and 7.8%, respectively. Given that patients with mental illness face multiple psychological and institutional barriers in seeking appropriate treatment, the high depression-induced medical costs may be primarily driven by the cost-shifting effect from mental health care to general health care, as mental disorders often coexist with other NCDs such as diabetes and hypertension. As an implication, our study calls for an urgent reform of China's mental health and insurance systems to remove the policy-induced obstacles for the access to mental health care resources.","['Hsieh, Chee-Ruey', 'Qin, Xuezheng']","['Hsieh CR', 'Qin X']","['School of Economics, University of Nottingham Ningbo China, Ningbo, China.', 'School of Economics, Peking University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171008,England,Health Econ,Health economics,9306780,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cost of Illness', 'Depression/diagnosis/*economics/therapy', 'Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/*economics/therapy', 'Female', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Mental Health Services/economics/*organization & administration/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Economic', '*Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Primary Health Care/economics/*organization & administration/statistics & numerical data', 'Social Stigma', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Suicide/statistics & numerical data']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['China', 'depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'mental health care system, medical cost']",2017/10/11 06:00,2019/05/29 06:00,['2017/10/10 06:00'],"['2016/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hec.3604 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Econ. 2018 Mar;27(3):525-544. doi: 10.1002/hec.3604.

The present research aims at exploring incremental validity when predicting (1) substance use specifically and (2) mental health generally among adolescents. METHODS: A prospective and longitudinal design was used to predict (1) initial substance use nine years into the future and (2) mental health one year and four years into the future. Participants were 318 adolescents (age 14 to 15 at the beginning of the study). RESULTS: Structural equation modeling revealed (1) that SOC had long-term incremental validity over N, E, and GSE for tobacco use and alcohol use, whereas cannabis use was predicted by E and GSE; and (2) that long-term mental health after four years was only predicted by SOC. CONCLUSIONS: Two studies provide further evidence for the importance of considering salutogenic factors when forecasting mental health and health-related behavior beyond classical constructs such as N, E, and GSE. Differences in criterion validity reveal that SOC cannot be equated with reversed neuroticism.","['Grevenstein, Dennis', 'Bluemke, Matthias', 'Kroeninger-Jungaberle, Henrik']","['Grevenstein D', 'Bluemke M', 'Kroeninger-Jungaberle H']","['Psychological Institute, University of Heidelberg, Hauptstrasse 47-51, 69117, Heidelberg, Germany. dennis.grevenstein@psychologie.uni-heidelberg.de.', 'Psychological Institute, University of Heidelberg, Hauptstrasse 47-51, 69117, Heidelberg, Germany. matthias.bluemke@psychologie.uni-heidelberg.de.', 'Institute of Medical Psychology, Center for Psychosocial Medicine, University Hospital Heidelberg, Bergheimer Str. 20, 69115, Heidelberg, Germany. henrik.jungaberle@finder-akademie.de.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20160114,England,Health Qual Life Outcomes,Health and quality of life outcomes,101153626,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety Disorders/*psychology', '*Extraversion, Psychological', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Neuroticism', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', '*Self Efficacy', '*Sense of Coherence', 'Substance-Related Disorders/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",PMC4712594,,,,2016/01/15 06:00,2016/09/14 06:00,['2016/01/15 06:00'],"['2015/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12955-016-0412-z [pii]', '412 [pii]', '10.1186/s12955-016-0412-z [doi]']",epublish,Health Qual Life Outcomes. 2016 Jan 14;14:9. doi: 10.1186/s12955-016-0412-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cross-sectional study explores resilience, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and family norms with disclosure of mental health problems (FNAD) in a sample of 182 Filipino American women (FAW). Participants completed survey measures of resilience, PTSD, and FNAD and open-ended questions about beliefs and reasons for (not) disclosing mental health problems outside the family. Previous research found that the rates of psychological trauma and depression among FAW are higher than those in other Asian ethnic groups, which makes it necessary to investigate the protective characteristic of resilience among FAW. According to our results, foreign-born FAW had a significantly lower PTSD and greater resilience as compared to their US-born counterparts. A significant negative relationship between PTSD and resilience was observed only among foreign-born FAW. We also found a conditional moderating effect of FNAD on the negative relationship between resilience and PTSD. The results of our qualitative analysis of the participants' responses to the open-ended questions of the survey showed that FAW's family norms of nondisclosure are related to the cultural value of ""saving face,"" a salient cultural construct among Asian family members. Results suggest that protective properties of resilience against PTSD are influenced by cultural factors, such as FNAD. Taken together, our findings underscore the importance of considering the impact of collectivistic cultural values (e.g., FNAD) in future research on resilience among Asian Americans.","['Reyes, Andrew Thomas', 'Constantino, Rose E', 'Cross, Chad L', 'Tan, Rhigel Alforque', 'Bombard, Judzia N']","['Reyes AT', 'Constantino RE', 'Cross CL', 'Tan RA', 'Bombard JN']","['School of Nursing, University of Nevada Las Vegas.', 'School of Nursing, University of Pittsburgh.', 'School of Medicine, University of Nevada Las Vegas.', 'School of Community Health Sciences, University of Nevada Las Vegas.', 'School of Nursing, University of Nevada Las Vegas.', 'School of Nursing, University of Nevada Las Vegas.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Behav Med,"Behavioral medicine (Washington, D.C.)",8804264,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asian/*psychology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Emigrants and Immigrants/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/ethnology/*trends', 'Middle Aged', 'Resilience, Psychological/*ethics', 'Self Disclosure', 'Social Norms/ethnology', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/psychology', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['American women', 'Asian American', 'Filipino', 'cultural norms', 'post-traumatic stress disorder', 'resilience']",2020/08/14 06:00,2021/10/13 06:00,['2020/08/14 06:00'],"['2020/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/08964289.2020.1725413 [doi]'],ppublish,Behav Med. 2020 Jul-Sep;46(3-4):217-230. doi: 10.1080/08964289.2020.1725413.,3-4,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2875-1124'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This cohort study was conducted at the Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre and the Tai Lam Centre for Women in Hong Kong. Remand prisoners aged >/=21 years were recruited between May and August 2014. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected. Each remand prisoner was assessed using the appropriate CMHS for males or for females, then interviewed by a specialist psychiatrist using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV for current affective disorder and psychotic disorder for cross-validation. RESULTS: A total of 245 remand prisoners were recruited (150 males and 95 females; mean age, 25.8 years). Of them, 51% (55% males and 44% females) had a lifetime history of psychiatric disorder, whereas 39.6% (46% males and 29.5% females) had a current psychiatric disorder. The most common psychiatric disorder was substance use disorder (>36%), followed by mood disorder (>20%), psychotic disorder (5.3%), and lifetime neurotic disorder (3.7%). Living in a public housing estate (odds ratio [OR] = 1.99), a history of childhood conduct problem (OR = 2.40), and a forensic history (OR = 1.97) were associated with an increased risk of having a psychiatric disorder. The CMHS had good diagnostic efficiency after cross-validation with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. CONCLUSION: Psychiatric disorders are prevalent in remand prisoners in Hong Kong. The CMHS is an effective tool to screen remand prisoners for timely treatment of prisoners with mental health needs.","['Chow, K Kw', 'Chan, O', 'Yu, M Wm', 'Lo, C Sl', 'Tang, D Yy', 'Chow, D Ly', 'Siu, B Wm', 'Cheung, E Fc']","['Chow KK', 'Chan O', 'Yu MW', 'Lo CS', 'Tang DY', 'Chow DL', 'Siu BW', 'Cheung EF']","['Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Castle Peak Hospital.', 'Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Castle Peak Hospital.', 'The Chinese University of Hong Kong.', 'Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Castle Peak Hospital.', 'Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Castle Peak Hospital.', 'Shatin Hospital.', 'Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Castle Peak Hospital.', 'Kwong Wah Hospital.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,East Asian Arch Psychiatry,East Asian archives of psychiatry : official journal of the Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists = Dong Ya jing shen ke xue zhi : Xianggang jing shen ke yi xue yuan qi kan,101536416,IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diagnostic Screening Programs', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Female', 'Hong Kong/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Interview, Psychological/methods', 'Male', '*Mental Disorders/classification/diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', '*Prisoners/psychology/statistics & numerical data']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mental disorders', 'Prisoners']",2018/12/20 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,East Asian Arch Psychiatry. 2018 Dec;28(4):134-138.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The findings revealed that the lifetime prevalence of GAD was 1.6% among the Singapore general population in 2016, an increase from the 0.9% in 2010. More lifetime GAD cases were reported across several sociodemographic groups including age and employment status. Lifetime GAD was significantly associated with higher odds of several comorbid psychiatric conditions (OR = 3.8-9.3, p < 0.05). Treatment seeking behavior did not differ significantly when compared to SMHS 2010 and there was still a considerable treatment gap among individuals with GAD.

People on such expeditions generally undergo psychological changes resulting from exposure to long periods of isolation and confinement, and the extreme physical environment. Symptoms include disturbed sleep, impaired cognitive ability, negative affect, and interpersonal tension and conflict. Seasonal occurrence of these symptoms suggests the existence of three overlapping syndromes: the winter-over syndrome, the polar T3 syndrome, and subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder. About 5% of people on expeditions meet DSM-IV or ICD criteria for psychiatric disorders. However, they also experience positive or so-called salutogenic outcomes resulting from successfully coping with stress and enhanced self-sufficiency, improved health, and personal growth. Prevention of pathogenic psychological outcomes is best accomplished by psychological and psychiatric screening procedures to select out unsuitable candidates, and by providing access to psychological support, including telephone counselling. Promotion of salutogenic experiences is best accomplished by screening for suitable personality traits, and training participants in individual coping strategies, group interaction, and team leadership.","['Palinkas, Lawrence A', 'Suedfeld, Peter']","['Palinkas LA', 'Suedfeld P']","['School of Social Work, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA. palinkas@usc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Antarctic Regions', 'Arctic Regions', 'Cognition Disorders/etiology/*psychology', 'Cold Climate/*adverse effects', 'Expeditions/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Personality', 'Sleep Wake Disorders/etiology/*psychology', 'Syndrome']",,,,,2007/07/28 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2007/07/28 09:00'],"['2007/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(07)61056-3 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61056-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2008 Jan 12;371(9607):153-63. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61056-3.,9607,,,,,,,,,,,,135,,,,,,,,,,

Certain fundamental dynamics of social life in Japan contribute to a sense of coherence in the lives of Japanese today. Analysts of modern Japan have noted that it has not become a replica of western societies in that primary social groups take precedence over individual needs and autonomy. Moreover, although the Japanese personality may be characterized as multilayered, one dominant aspect is the tendency to suppress negative feelings-towards intimates, family and those in authority. This tendency has implications for the patient-physician relationship, which tends to be ritualized to protect a patient's innermost feelings. Because there has never been a split between mind and body in Japanese thinking there is no concept of mental health that is separate from physical health; rather, patients and physicians readily accept that illness is an expression of stress on the social level. As a corollary, the responsibility for healing is felt to be in the hands of patients and their families, with physicians playing the part of skilled and sympathetic technicians. Ascribing the origins of a cultural identity risks stereotyping, but understanding the reasons for the continuity of certain values in Japanese immigrants will enable physicians to use these values to advantage, and explains the healthy adaptation of these immigrants to the disruption of migration.","['Lock, M']",['Lock M'],,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,West J Med,The Western journal of medicine,0410504,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Asian/*psychology', 'Culture', 'Disease/psychology', 'Ego', 'Emigration and Immigration', 'Family', 'Humans', 'Japan/ethnology', 'Mental Health', 'Social Behavior', '*Social Change', 'Social Control, Formal', 'United States']",PMC1011012,,,,1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,West J Med. 1983 Dec;139(6):829-34.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deprivation varies geographically and deprived areas may be proximal to advantaged areas. In theory, this leads to chronic stress and poor mental health. This research explored whether socioeconomically isolated deprived areas experience increased levels of anxiety/mental disorder treatment, compared to other deprived areas. We developed a spatial isolation measure to characterise deprived areas surrounded by advantaged areas in Auckland, New Zealand. We found that isolated areas were characterised by fewer Maori and Pacific people, high density and shorter travel time to General Practitioners. We found significantly higher rates of anxiety/mood disorder treatment in highly isolated versus non-isolated areas and a statistically significant relationship with anxiety/mood disorders for each isolation level, both before and after confounder adjustment. This evidence suggests that mental health within small areas may be sensitive to the neighbourhood interactions, through social comparison or discrimination which lead to psychosocial stress.","['Pearson, Amber L', 'Griffin, Edward', 'Davies, Anna', 'Kingham, Simon']","['Pearson AL', 'Griffin E', 'Davies A', 'Kingham S']","['University of Canterbury, Department of Geography, GeoHealth Laboratory, Christchurch, New Zealand. amber.pearson@otago.ac.nz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121122,England,Health Place,Health & place,9510067,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anxiety Disorders/economics/*ethnology', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/economics/*ethnology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mood Disorders/economics/*ethnology', 'Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander/*psychology', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', 'Population Density', '*Poverty Areas', 'Regression Analysis', 'Social Isolation/*psychology', 'Spatial Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2012/12/25 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/12/25 06:00'],"['2012/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1353-8292(12)00192-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.healthplace.2012.10.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Health Place. 2013 Jan;19:159-66. doi: 10.1016/j.healthplace.2012.10.012.

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of parental income level, including income mobility, during childhood and risks for developing mental disorders diagnosed in secondary care in young adulthood. METHODS: National cohort study of persons born in Denmark 1980-2000 (N = 1,051,265). Parental income was measured during birth year and at ages 5, 10 and 15. Follow-up began from 15th birthday until mental disorder diagnosis or 31 December 2016, whichever occurred first. Hazard ratios and cumulative incidence were estimated. RESULTS: A quarter (25.2%; 95% CI 24.8-25.6%) of children born in the lowest income quintile families will have a secondary care-diagnosed mental disorder by age 37, versus 13.5% (13.2-13.9%) of those born in the highest income quintile. Longer time spent living in low-income families was associated with higher risks of developing mental disorders. Associations were strongest for substance misuse and personality disorders and weaker for mood disorders and anxiety/somatoform disorders. An exception was eating disorders, with low parental income being associated with attenuated risk. For all diagnostic categories examined except for eating disorders, downward socioeconomic mobility was linked with higher subsequent risk and upward socioeconomic mobility with lower subsequent risk of developing mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Except for eating disorders, low parental income during childhood is associated with subsequent increased risk of mental disorders diagnosed in secondary care across the diagnostic spectrum. Early interventions to mitigate the disadvantages linked with low income, and better opportunities for upward socioeconomic mobility could reduce social and mental health inequalities.","['Hakulinen, Christian', 'Mok, Pearl L H', 'Horsdal, Henriette Thisted', 'Pedersen, Carsten B', 'Mortensen, Preben B', 'Agerbo, Esben', 'Webb, Roger T']","['Hakulinen C', 'Mok PLH', 'Horsdal HT', 'Pedersen CB', 'Mortensen PB', 'Agerbo E', 'Webb RT']","['Department of Psychology and Logopedics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, P.O.

By any measure, it is among the most severe mental health problems occurring in young people, uniquely predicting debilitating current problems and acting as a 'gateway' to diverse and serious future problems. Yet, PD still struggles for legitimacy and parity of access to services, including early intervention. CONCLUSION: Addressing PD is fundamental to youth mental health, and early intervention for PD has reached 'proof of concept'. Yet, reform is hindered by bigotry and sectarianism. Successful early intervention calls for a shift in the culture of services, countering damaging myths, addressing bigotry, and fostering hope.

A non-causal relation will not form the basis of effective public health interventions. This may be why psychosocial interventions have, so far, showed little effect on objective physical health outcomes. This paper reviews evidence for the ""psychosocial hypothesis"" and suggests strategies for clarifying these issues. It concludes that, although misery is clearly a bad thing as it erodes people's quality of life, there is little evidence that psychosocial factors cause physical disease. In the absence of better evidence, suggestions that psychosocial interventions are needed to improve population physical health, in both absolute and relative terms, seem premature.","['Macleod, J', 'Davey Smith, G']","['Macleod J', 'Davey Smith G']","['Department of Primary Care and General Practice, University of Birmingham, UK. j.a.macleod@bham.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,IM,"['*Attitude to Health', 'Disease/*etiology/psychology', 'Health Policy', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Poverty', 'Psychology, Social/standards', 'Psychotherapy/organization & administration', 'Public Health/*standards', '*Quality of Life', 'Social Class']",PMC1732553,,,,2003/07/29 05:00,2003/09/27 05:00,['2003/07/29 05:00'],"['2003/07/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jech.57.8.565 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 2003 Aug;57(8):565-70. doi: 10.1136/jech.57.8.565.,8,,"['J Epidemiol Community Health. 2003 Aug;57(8):553-6; discussion 554-5.

The present study examined gender differences in sexual risk behaviours and STI among adolescents in mental health treatment. METHODS: Three hundred and seventy nine sexually active adolescents, aged 13-18 years, from a larger multisite study, who received mental health treatment during the past year, completed an audio computer-assisted self interview assessing sociodemographics, psychiatric symptomatology and HIV/STI risk behaviours, and provided urine specimens tested for STI. RESULTS: After controlling for covariates, multivariate logistic regression models indicated that female adolescents were more likely to have had an HIV test (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=3.2, P=0.0001), obtain their HIV test results (AOR=2.9, P=0.03), refuse sex out of fear for STI acquisition (AOR=1.7, P=0.04), or avoid a situation that might lead to sex (AOR=2.4, P=0.001), and were less likely to have a casual sex partner (AOR=0.40, P=0.002). Additionally, females were more likely to report inconsistent condom use (AOR=2.60, P=0.001) and have a STI (AOR=9.1, P=0.0001) than their male counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Female adolescents receiving mental health treatment were more than nine times as likely to have an STI and more likely to use condoms inconsistently. The standard of care for mental health practice for adolescents should include referrals for STI screening and treatment as well as assessment and discussion of risky sexual behaviours as part of the treatment plan when indicated. Effective programs should address gender-specific communication and behavioural skills.","['Seth, Puja', 'Lang, Delia L', 'Diclemente, Ralph J', 'Braxton, Nikia D', 'Crosby, Richard A', 'Brown, Larry K', 'Hadley, Wendy', 'Donenberg, Geri R']","['Seth P', 'Lang DL', 'Diclemente RJ', 'Braxton ND', 'Crosby RA', 'Brown LK', 'Hadley W', 'Donenberg GR']","['Department of Behavioral Sciences and Health Education, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. pseth@cdc.gov']",['eng'],"['P30 AI050409/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH063008/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'MH63008/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,Australia,Sex Health,Sexual health,101242667,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior/*psychology', 'Attitude to Health', 'Community Mental Health Centers/organization & administration', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Health Promotion/organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', '*Risk-Taking', 'Sex Distribution', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Bacterial/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Unsafe Sex/psychology/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC4452011,['NIHMS692455'],,,2012/06/16 06:00,2012/10/12 06:00,['2012/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['SH10098 [pii]', '10.1071/SH10098 [doi]']",ppublish,Sex Health. 2012 Jul;9(3):240-6. doi: 10.1071/SH10098.,3,,,['Conflicts of interest: None declared.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The emerging field of implementation science has begun to systematically investigate strategies for more efficiently integrating evidence-based practices into community settings. Significantly less translational research has focused specifically on the school setting. To address this need, we examined the implementation of a school-based trauma intervention across three distinct regions. DESIGN: We conducted key informant interviews guided by Mendel's Framework of Dissemination in Health Services Intervention Research with multiple school stakeholders to examine what school organizational characteristics influence the adoption and implementation process and sustainability of Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS). Participants were selected from schools in three geographic regions in the United States: Western, Midwestern, and Southern. RESULTS: Our findings reveal that while sites had some common organizational factors that appeared to facilitate implementation, regions differed in how they compensated for less robust implementation domains. Across all regions, school stakeholders recognized the need for services to support students impacted by trauma. In the Western region, there was no centralized district policy for implementation; therefore, implementation was facilitated by school-level change agents and supervision support from the district mental health unit. In the Midwestern region, centralized district policies drove implementation. In both the Midwestern and Southern regions, implementation was facilitated by collaboration with a local mental health agency. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the paucity of empirical information on the organizational factors that influence the implementation of evidence-based mental health interventions in schools. Our findings reveal that different implementation strategies across policies, structures, and resources can result in implementation of a school-based intervention. Frameworks such as Mendel's can be helpful in identifying areas of strength and improvement of implementation within a school organization.","['Vona, Pamela', 'Baweja, Shilpa', 'Santiago, Catherine DeCarlo', 'Pears, Gillian', 'Langley, Audra', 'Kataoka, Sheryl']","['Vona P', 'Baweja S', 'Santiago CD', 'Pears G', 'Langley A', 'Kataoka S']","['Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, University of Southern California; Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Education and Information Studies, University of California, Los Angeles; Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Psychology, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, Center for Health Services and Society; University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.', 'UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, Center for Health Services and Society; University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.', 'UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, Center for Health Services and Society; University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180906,United States,Ethn Dis,Ethnicity & disease,9109034,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Community Participation', 'Health Services Research', 'Humans', '*Mental Health/standards/trends', 'Mental Health Services/*organization & administration', 'Needs Assessment', 'Program Evaluation', 'School Health Services/*organization & administration', 'Stress Disorders, Traumatic/*therapy', 'Students/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'United States']",PMC6128334,,['NOTNLM'],"['Community Participation', 'Implementation', 'Mental Health Services', 'School-based Services', 'Traumatic Stress Disorder']",2018/09/12 06:00,2019/10/12 06:00,['2018/09/12 06:00'],"['2018/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['ed.28.S2.427 [pii]', '10.18865/ed.28.S2.427 [doi]']",epublish,Ethn Dis. 2018 Sep 6;28(Suppl 2):427-436. doi: 10.18865/ed.28.S2.427. eCollection 2018.,Suppl 2,,,['Competing Interests: None declared.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: MDE prevalence has been assessed in national surveys that either used a short form version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form for Major Depression (CIDI-SFMD) or an adaptation of the World Health Organization's (full-length) version, World Mental Health (WMH) CIDI. We applied meta-regression methods to adjust for instrument type while also addressing design effects in the individual data sets. Interprovincial differences that might have confounded estimation of national trends were also explored. RESULTS: Interprovincial differences were not found to be significant, nor were time by province interactions. Estimates based on the WMH-CIDI were about 1% lower than those using the CIDI-SFMD. There was no evidence of changing prevalence over time, with slope for time, adjusted for assessment instrument, being nearly zero (beta=0.0007, P=0.24). CONCLUSION: An extensive collection of surveys conducted in Canada between 1994 and 2012 provide an opportunity to examine long-term trends in the prevalence of major depression. MDE prevalence has not changed during this period of time.","['Patten, Scott B', 'Williams, Jeanne V A', 'Lavorato, Dina H', 'Fiest, Kirsten M', 'Bulloch, Andrew G M', 'Wang, JianLi']","['Patten SB', 'Williams JV', 'Lavorato DH', 'Fiest KM', 'Bulloch AG', 'Wang J']","['Professor, Departments of Community Health Sciences and Psychiatry, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta; Member, Mathison Centre for Mental Health Research & Education, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta.', 'Research Associate, Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta.', 'Research Associate, Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta.', 'Post-doctoral Fellow, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta.', 'Professor, Departments of Community Health Sciences and Psychiatry, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta; Member, Mathison Centre for Mental Health Research & Education, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta.', 'Associate Professor, Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta; Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta; Member, Mathison Centre for Mental Health Research & Education, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta.']",['eng'],['mop-130415/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Can J Psychiatry,Canadian journal of psychiatry.

It develops a concept in line with the naturalistic viewpoint in the philosophy of medicine. METHODS: The concept of mental function is scrutinized. Functions are regarded as effects of traits that enable an organism to live independently. The significance of this theoretical perspective for the psychiatric practice is discussed. Finally, the developed conceptualization is compared to the current edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: It is emphasized that the theoretical conceptualization of mental disorder determines what may justifiably and in a scientifically valid way be deemed a disease entity. Nevertheless, the practical perspective needs an additional element of individual well-being as not every mental dysfunction involves impairment in this respect. It is claimed that the DSM takes a perspective similar to the one defended in this article.","['Schramme, T']",['Schramme T'],"['Philosophisches Seminar, Universitat Hamburg, Von-Melle-Park 6, 20146, Hamburg, Deutschland, thomas.schramme@uni-hamburg.de.']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Nervenarzt,Der Nervenarzt,0400773,IM,"['*Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Germany', 'Humans', '*International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health', 'Mental Health/*classification', 'Neurocognitive Disorders/*classification/*diagnosis/psychology', '*Terminology as Topic']",,,,,2014/10/10 06:00,2016/01/01 06:00,['2014/10/10 06:00'],"['2014/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00115-014-4106-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Nervenarzt. 2015 Jan;86(1):16-21. doi: 10.1007/s00115-014-4106-7.,1,,,,,Psychische Krankheit als Storung wesentlicher Funktionen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While mental health practitioners need to understand the psycho-biological issues that impact the person and family with an eating disorder, there is much about this complex condition that eludes and escapes a bio-medical perspective. Use of an aesthetic lens on the issue can illuminate various challenges, tensions and insights that people with disordered eating experience along the journey of their ill-health and on to their recovery, but which often remain unstated in the clinical context. Scholars within the creative arts discipline are experts in making judgements about the quality of artworks they encounter and have highly developed aesthetic knowing. Yet, the central skills and knowledges embodied in creative arts activity are not widely utilized outside that sphere. This article reports on how aesthetics can be applied to sensitize mental health practitioners to appreciate the lived experience of a mental health challenge such as an eating disorder. Such mental health practitioners play an important role in the health service, yet the widespread diffusion of the bio-medical model into mental health, once characterized for its equal emphasis on the psycho-social-cultural, has led to criticisms of an over-focus on illness identification, at the expense of accommodating the meanings of subjective and unique experiences of mental health, struggle and recovery.

Particularly in poor post-conflict regions, these mental disorders have the potential to impair the ability of individuals to move on with their lives. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility, cultural acceptance, and effect of a trauma-focused psychotherapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET), in the aftermath of a flood disaster in Burundi. METHODS: Fifty-one individuals who were living in emergency camps overseen by the Burundian Red Cross in the aftermath of a flood disaster, and who had lost homes and close relatives, were invited to participate in semi-structured diagnostic interviews. Trained Burundian psychology students conducted these interviews, and six sessions of NET were offered to the 15 individuals most affected by trauma-related symptoms. An additional group of psychology students, blind to the treatment conditions, conducted three and 9 months follow-ups with them including also 25 participants who had reported significant but less severe trauma-related symptoms, assessing mental health symptoms, acceptance of NET, stigmatization due to trauma symptoms, and participants' economic well-being. RESULTS: Between baseline and 9-months post-intervention assessment, symptoms of PTSD (Hedges' g = 3.44) and depression (Hedges' g = 1.88) improved significantly within participants who received NET and within those who received no treatment (Hedges' g(PTSD) = 2.55; Hedges' g(depression) = 0.72). Furthermore, those who received NET felt less stigmatized by their participation in the intervention than by the trauma-related mental health symptoms they experienced. Overall, participants reported that they would be willing to forego as much as 1 month's worth of income in exchange for receiving trauma-focused interventions in the months following the disaster. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals severely affected by trauma-related mental health symptoms might benefit significantly from NET in the aftermath of natural disasters, while less affected individuals seem to recover spontaneously. Despite significant challenges conducting NET in emergency camps in the aftermath of natural disaster in a post-conflict country, such interventions are feasible, appreciated and might have long-lasting impacts on the lives of survivors if conducted with due respect to participants' privacy.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Psychiatric nosology is confronted by similar challenges as every general nosology. Among these are the role of dysfunction versus ""normal"" function, the fuzzy boundary of health and disorder, the role of subjective suffering and the role of causal mechanisms. In the case of mental disorders, a further issue is that every nosology has to take a stance about what mental processes actually are. In this article, the disorder concepts of the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5) and of the research domain criteria (RDoC) approach of the National Institute of Mental Health are explained and discussed. Furthermore, it is argued that a sound psychiatric nosology should not be purely descriptive but should also take the causal mechanisms of disorders into account. A recent suggestion, the theory of mechanistic property clusters, is introduced. Taking recent discussion on the philosophy of mind into account, it becomes apparent that the obvious assumption that mental disorders are (nothing more than) disorders of the brain might not be correct: at least this has been suggested by the theory of situated cognition. It is concluded that a sound psychiatric nosology will have to consider contemporary theories of mental disorders; however, such a synthesis has yet to be formulated.","['Walter, H', 'Muller, J']","['Walter H', 'Muller J']","['Klinik fur Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charite Mitte, Chariteplatz 1, 10117, Berlin, Deutschland, henrik.walter@charite.de.']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Nervenarzt,Der Nervenarzt,0400773,IM,"['*Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*classification/diagnosis/*psychology', 'Mental Health/*classification', 'Neurosciences/*trends', 'Psychophysiology/*trends']",,,,,2015/01/13 06:00,2016/01/01 06:00,['2015/01/11 06:00'],"['2015/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00115-014-4113-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Nervenarzt. 2015 Jan;86(1):22-8. doi: 10.1007/s00115-014-4113-8.,1,,,,,Der Beitrag der Neurowissenschaften zum psychiatrischen Krankheitsbegriff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this commentary, we describe some additional strengths of the SSI approach and highlight their potential in the use of stepped care models of treatment.

They were all located in the asylum along with severe and chronic cases. Dr Helen Boyle worked among London's poor in the 1890s and observed the deterioration of cases of nervous disorder and borderline insanity due to their lack of treatment. The early treatment of borderline cases was the aim of Boyle's charitable hospital, founded in 1905, for nervous disorders in women and girls. Boyle's interest in mental disorder included the mentally defective and she was a founder member of the Guardianship Society which sought to keep those defined as such within the community. The history of the care and treatment of the 'insane' has concentrated largely on the public and private asylums. London-based facilities such as the Tavis-tock clinic and the Maudsley Hospital, which both treated rate-aided patients in the inter-war period, have been given a great deal of attention because of wealthy benefactors and the involvement of high profile individuals. Boyle's unique in-patient facility in Brighton preceded the Maudsley by almost 20 years and as such fills an important gap in mental health history. Boyle's work challenged the lunacy laws and set out to establish a holistic system of care for recoverable conditions outside the asylum system. This essay concentrates on the work of Dr Helen Boyle in Brighton but also highlights other facilities that were available for rate-aided patients, which have been neglected in the historiography of mental health care.","['Westwood, L']",['Westwood L'],,['eng'],,"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,England,Soc Hist Med,Social history of medicine : the journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine,8810360,,"['History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', '*Hospitals, Psychiatric/*history', 'Mental Health/*history', 'United Kingdom']",,,,,2002/01/29 10:00,2002/02/07 10:01,['2002/01/29 10:00'],"['2002/01/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/shm/14.3.439 [doi]'],ppublish,Soc Hist Med. 2001 Dec;14(3):439-57. doi: 10.1093/shm/14.3.439.,3,,,,,,,,,,['Boyle H'],"['Boyle, H']",,,,,,,,,,,

This article asks whether the reconfiguration will end reliance upon preventive detention for public protection. Drawing on original empirical data collected by the author, it is argued that the government is unaware that offenders with 'severe personality disorder' appear to engage with treatment only if it increases their chances of achieving expedited parole. Hitherto, this incentive was provided by the Indeterminate Sentence for Public Protection; its replacement with determinate sentences under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 will worsen treatment engagement, because they provide offenders with a prison release date. The troubling result may be increased reliance by the Secretary of State for Justice on his inherent jurisdiction under the Mental Health Act 1983 to transfer offenders due for prison release to secure psychiatric hospitals. To counter this limitation of risk-focused decision-making, it is proposed that judges be able to impose a new hybrid order combining a custodial term with a subsequent community mental health treatment requirement.","['McRae, Leon']",['McRae L'],"['Birmingham Law School, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK l.mcrae@bham.ac.uk.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150601,England,Med Law Rev,Medical law review,9308945,IM,"['*Criminal Law', 'Criminals/legislation & jurisprudence/*psychology', 'Decision Making', 'Human Rights', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Personality Disorders/*rehabilitation', 'Psychiatric Rehabilitation/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'United Kingdom']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Decision-making', 'Human rights', 'Mental Health Act 1983', 'Preventive detention', 'Risk', 'Severe personality disorder']",2015/06/04 06:00,2016/05/31 06:00,['2015/06/04 06:00'],"['2015/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/31 06:00 [medline]']","['fwv021 [pii]', '10.1093/medlaw/fwv021 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Law Rev. 2015 Summer;23(3):321-47. doi: 10.1093/medlaw/fwv021.

Male adolescents (N = 222) aged 13-18 years completed validated self-report screening measures for traumatic experiences and likely PTSD. One-third (34.3%) scored above a selected cutoff, suggesting that they are likely to have PTSD. A higher incidence of premigration traumatic events was associated with greater PTSD symptomatology. Children living in semi-independent care arrangements were more likely to report increased PTSD symptoms when compared to their peers in foster care. A substantial majority in this study did not score above the cutoff, raising the possibility of notable levels of resilience. Future research should consider approaching mental health issues from a resilience perspective to further the understanding of protective mechanisms for this at-risk population.","['Bronstein, Israel', 'Montgomery, Paul', 'Dobrowolski, Stephanie']","['Bronstein I', 'Montgomery P', 'Dobrowolski S']","['Centre for Evidence Based Intervention, Department of Social Policy & Intervention, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. raeli.bronstein@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121015,United States,J Trauma Stress,Journal of traumatic stress,8809259,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Afghanistan/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Refugees/*psychology', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*epidemiology/psychology', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,,,,2012/10/17 06:00,2013/04/11 06:00,['2012/10/17 06:00'],"['2012/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jts.21740 [doi]'],ppublish,J Trauma Stress. 2012 Oct;25(5):551-7. doi: 10.1002/jts.21740.

Social media data are a quantifiable link into the otherwise elusive daily lives of patients, providing an avenue for study and assessment of behavioral and environmental disease risk factors. Analogous to the genome, social media data linked to medical diagnoses can be banked with patients' consent, and an encoding of social media language can be used as markers of disease risk, serve as a screening tool, and elucidate disease epidemiology. In what we believe to be the first report linking electronic medical record data with social media data from consenting patients, we identified that patients' Facebook status updates can predict many health conditions, suggesting opportunities to use social media data to determine disease onset or exacerbation and to conduct social media-based health interventions.","['Merchant, Raina M', 'Asch, David A', 'Crutchley, Patrick', 'Ungar, Lyle H', 'Guntuku, Sharath C', 'Eichstaedt, Johannes C', 'Hill, Shawndra', 'Padrez, Kevin', 'Smith, Robert J', 'Schwartz, H Andrew']","['Merchant RM', 'Asch DA', 'Crutchley P', 'Ungar LH', 'Guntuku SC', 'Eichstaedt JC', 'Hill S', 'Padrez K', 'Smith RJ', 'Schwartz HA']","['Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Penn Medicine Center for Health Care Innovation, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Penn Medicine Center for Health Care Innovation, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'The Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion-Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Positive Psychology Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Positive Psychology Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Penn Medicine Center for Health Care Innovation, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Positive Psychology Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Microsoft Research, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Positive Psychology Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190617,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Depression', 'Depressive Disorder', 'Diabetes Mellitus/diagnosis', 'Diagnosis', '*Disease', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Language', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders', '*Mental Health', '*Models, Biological', '*Social Media']",PMC6576767,,,,2019/06/18 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2018/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-18-34864 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0215476 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jun 17;14(6):e0215476. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0215476. eCollection 2019.,6,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9801-6881', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4400-9309', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2929-0035', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9746-1230']",,"['Regarding the commercial affiliation of author SH with Microsoft: This does not', 'alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: This cross-sectional observational study enrolled 389 male Lebanese students (aged 13-17 years) between October and December 2019. Results: After adjusting for the covariates (age, body mass index, and House Crowding Index), those with CVS had significantly higher mean depression (P < .001), anxiety (P = .003), and insomnia (P = .007) scores compared to those without CVS. The presence of CVS was associated with significantly higher depression (B = 3.25), anxiety (B = 4.11), and insomnia (B = 4.49), but not aggression. Stress mediated the association between CVS and depression, anxiety, insomnia, and aggression (P < .001 for all).

Conceptualizing disease impact and treatment outcomes.,2316-26,,"The focus of assessment of disease impact is moving beyond survival and biomedical outcomes to include a comprehensive set of health status and quality of life concepts. We have discussed four socially relevant concepts that can be thought of as dimensions of health status or well being: physiologic status, personal (physical) functioning, mental health, and social well-being. Quality of life was also discussed briefly as a very global concept encompassing these health status dimensions and a broader set of concepts including finances, housing, and employment. Five categories of measures based on manifest content were also discussed, including measures of disease/diagnostic status, personal functioning, mental health, general health perceptions, and social/role functioning. The physiologic dimension of health is very heterogeneous and includes many concepts and measures that vary largely independently of each other and that differ in terms of their impact on the other dimensions of health status. The physical, mental, and social dimensions of health and well-being also can be measured many different ways, and each can be broken down into distinct concepts that may vary in importance from one study to another. Of these three concepts, social well-being is the most heterogeneous. To assist investigators searching for valid measures of specific health status and quality of life concepts, we recommended formal estimations of measurement models. A preliminary model of 15 health status measures was presented to illustrate the usefulness of such a model.","['Ware, J E Jr']",['Ware JE Jr'],,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Attitude to Health', 'Disease/*psychology', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', '*Quality of Life', 'Role', 'Sociometric Techniques']",,,,,1984/05/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1984/05/15 00:00'],"['1984/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1984/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.1984.53.s10.2316 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1984 May 15;53(10 Suppl):2316-26. doi: 10.1002/cncr.1984.53.s10.2316.,10 Suppl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the current study was to assess the multidimensionality of Chinese versions of U.S.-derived instruments designed to evaluate a broad spectrum of emotional, behavioral, social, and thought problems in older adults. The Older Adult Self-Report (OASR) and Older Adult Behavior Checklist (OABCL) were completed by 686 and 639 older adults, respectively, aged 60 to 99 years, from a sample of 755 older adults. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) on the 97 OASR/OABCL problem items found that the models showed good fit according to our primary and secondary fit indices. None of the seven syndromes showed informant effects, whereas four showed small sex effects, and three showed small age effects. Overall, findings demonstrate the applicability of the seven syndrome OASR/OABCL model to Chinese older adults and support the use of these instruments to assess older adult mental health in Chinese clinical and research settings. These standardized tools can help health care professionals more comprehensively assess cognitive, behavioral, and mental health problems among Chinese-speaking older adult populations.

An 11-item two-factor structure was identified. In Study 2, a community sample of 426 participants completed a battery of questionnaires including the C-19ASS. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis was performed on the C-19ASS. A 9-item two-factor structure was confirmed. Results also indicated that the C-19ASS has acceptable levels of reliability and concurrent validity. The C-19ASS perseveration factor was found to explain an additional 9.3% variance in COVID-19 anxiety, and additional 2.2% variance in work and social adjustment (functional impairment), over and above all other variables. The C-19ASS appears to be a reliable and valid measure of the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome.

This depends on the functional health status, e.g. according to the international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF) which discriminates between impairment of functions, limitations in activity and capacity and participation restrictions. The German social law (SGB IX) defines disability as a chronic health status which lasts longer than 6 months and which results in participation restrictions. Participation restrictions are impaired capacities which not allow context or role requirements to be fulfilled. There are many instruments to measure capacities, such as the Mini-ICF-APP which was especially developed for mental disorders. As most mental disorders are chronic illnesses which lead to participation restrictions they must be conceptualized as mental disabilities. The consequence is that they must be treated under a social psychiatric perspective focussing on functions, capacities and context alike.","['Linden, M']",['Linden M'],"['Abteilung fur psychische und psychosomatische Erkrankungen, Rehabilitationszentrum Seehof der Deutschen Rentenversicherung Bund, Lichterfelder Allee 55, 14513, Teltow, Deutschland, michael.linden@charite.de.']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Nervenarzt,Der Nervenarzt,0400773,IM,"['*Disability Evaluation', 'Humans', '*International Classification of Diseases', '*International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health', 'Mental Disorders/*classification/*diagnosis/psychology', 'Mental Health/*classification', 'Psychometrics/methods']",,,,,2015/01/13 06:00,2016/01/01 06:00,['2015/01/11 06:00'],"['2015/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00115-014-4112-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Nervenarzt. 2015 Jan;86(1):29-35. doi: 10.1007/s00115-014-4112-9.,1,,,,,Krankheit und Behinderung.

First, we ask whether the impact of social disorder on internalizing symptoms results from comparisons with conditions measured locally or across the entire city.  Second, we consider whether neighborhood collective efficacy modifies disorder's effect on internalizing symptoms. Finally,  we assess whether these effects vary by gender. Analyses of survey data on 2,367 youth from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods indicate that social disorder is positively associated with girls' internalizing symptoms when measured as a deviation from a neighborhood cluster (NC--two to three census tracts) mean. High collective efficacy within girls' NCs attenuates disorder effects on their internalizing symptoms. We find no evidence of disorder or collective efficacy effects on boys' internalizing symptoms.","['Browning, Christopher R', 'Soller, Brian', 'Gardner, Margo', 'Brooks-Gunn, Jeanne']","['Browning CR', 'Soller B', 'Gardner M', 'Brooks-Gunn J']","['1The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 HD057945/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Health Soc Behav,Journal of health and social behavior,0103130,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Affective Symptoms', 'Anomie', 'Chicago', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', '*Mental Health', 'Models, Statistical', '*Residence Characteristics', 'Sex Factors']",PMC5831256,['NIHMS886314'],['NOTNLM'],"['adolescents', 'collective efficacy', 'disorder', 'internalizing', 'neighborhoods']",2013/09/13 06:00,2014/07/06 06:00,['2013/09/13 06:00'],"['2013/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['54/3/296 [pii]', '10.1177/0022146513498510 [doi]']",ppublish,J Health Soc Behav. 2013;54(3):296-314. doi: 10.1177/0022146513498510.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under a professional services contract with the National Institute of Mental Health, researchers who investigate women's mental health met during the American Psychiatric Association (APA) meeting in San Diego, California, on May 19, 1997. The 18 participants discussed key clinical and biological assessments and subsequently submitted papers reflecting scientific conclusions and recommendations for standardizing these assessments. It was agreed that a unified assessment instrument would be beneficial, but due to the widespread requirements and numerous factors that are critical in assessing all areas of women's health, situation-specific forms are often needed.

Also, health statistics by education, income, health insurance coverage, marital status, and place of residence are presented for health status and limitations in activity, health care access and utilization, health behaviors, and knowledge and attitudes toward AIDS. SOURCE OF DATA: The NHIS is a multistage probability sample survey conducted annually by interviewers of the U.S. Census Bureau for the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and is representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Data are collected during face-to-face interviews with adults present at the time of the interview. The self-reported health information for adults in this report was obtained from one randomly-selected adult per family. HIGHLIGHTS: In 1999, 65% of adults 18 years of age or over reported excellent or very good health. However, 17% of adults less than 65 years of age had no health insurance coverage, and 16% of adults did not have a usual place of medical care. Eleven percent of adults had ever been told by a doctor or health professional that they had heart disease and 19% had been told on two or more visits that they had hypertension. Nearly a quarter of adults were current smokers, while 23% were former smokers. Sixty-one percent did not engage in any leisure-time vigorous physical activity, and, based on estimates of body mass index, 35% were overweight and 21% were obese.","['Pleis, John R', 'Coles, Richard']","['Pleis JR', 'Coles R']","['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Division of Health Interview Statistics, Hyattsville, Maryland 20782, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Vital Health Stat 10,"Vital and health statistics.

To provide an objective and comprehensive measure of their stress-related physiological dysregulations, we indexed allostatic load with 14 biomarkers collected within 24 h of patients' admission to the largest psychiatric hospital in the Canadian province of Quebec. METHODS: This study (N = 278) combines data for emergency patients (n = 76; 65.8% women; M age = 44.97, SE = 1.6) and hospital workers who served as sex- and age-matched controls (n = 202; 70.8% women; M age = 40.10, SE = 0.83). Sex-specific allostatic load indices summarized neuroendocrine (cortisol), immune (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, c-reactive protein), metabolic (insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, body mass index), and cardiovascular (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) functioning. Well-validated questionnaires assessed substance (ab)use. RESULTS: Individuals presenting at psychiatric emergency showed elevated allostatic load, drug abuse, and tobacco use compared to controls. Elevated allostatic load in emergency patients was driven by elevated cortisol, interleukin-6, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate; however, allostatic load was not explained by substance (ab)use or demographic variables. Sub-group analyses revealed that emergency patients primarily diagnosed with bipolar, depressive, or anxiety disorders showed higher allostatic load than those diagnosed with personality disorder(s). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that individuals presenting at psychiatric emergency services show physiological dysregulations associated with chronic stress. Future research should explore the clinical utility of allostatic load in predicting comorbidities among psychiatric patients.","['Juster, Robert-Paul', 'Sasseville, Marc', 'Giguere, Charles-Edouard', 'Consortium, Signature', 'Lupien, Sonia J']","['Juster RP', 'Sasseville M', 'Giguere CE', 'Consortium S', 'Lupien SJ']","['Department of Psychiatry and Addiction, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada; Institut universitaire en sante mentale de Montreal, Centre integre universitaire de sante et service sociaux Est, Montreal, Canada.

However, little is known about which topics tend to be covered by outcome measures and whether they reflect the typical concerns of this patient group. This study followed a scoping review methodology in which 42 outcome measures recommended by an EU agency for substance use disorders were reviewed. We identified the domains of problems covered by these 42 measures and then compared them with 54 domains derived from patients, in a previous study. We also explored how similar the existing measures were in terms of domains covered, and which patient derived domains tended to be represented in those measures. We identified 31domains of problems across the 42 measures, with 'substance use' and 'psychological health' among the commonest. Most measures were similar in content to each other and multidimensional. Almost all domains of problems identified in the outcome measures corresponded to concerns reported by patients. On the other hand, we found that several topics of relevance for patients were not covered by any of the measure included in our study. This suggests that existing outcome measurement does not always target aspects that affect patients' lives, as reported directly by patients. Our study shows that outcome measurement needs to adopt a more flexible and comprehensive approach, by taking on board the problems experienced by patients in this population.","['Alves, Paula', 'Sales, Celia', 'Ashworth, Mark']","['Alves P', 'Sales C', 'Ashworth M']","['University College London, London, United Kingdom.

Reliability, concurrent validity and convergent validity of SQD were estimated. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha was 0.86. Concurrent validity as measured by the Spearman correlation coefficient resulted statistically significant both for PTSD and depression SQD subscales, as well as convergent validity as measured by ROC-AUC method.

A list of 25 symptoms of post-COVID-19 was used to measure the symptoms, and exploratory factor analysis was undertaken to identify symptom clusters for people with symptoms lasting 5 to 8 weeks and 9 weeks or longer. Six symptom clusters were identified for each of the two groups, and five clusters were similar across both groups: respiratory, general viral, smell/taste, cognitive cardiac, and mental health. The >9-week group reported symptoms primarily from two factors: respiratory-muscular and mental health. Post-COVID-19 symptom clusters differ across timeframes. Symptom clusters were useful in establishing coherent patterns of multiple complex symptoms.","['Larson, Janet L', 'Zhou, Weijiao', 'Veliz, Philip T', 'Smith, Sheree']","['Larson JL', 'Zhou W', 'Veliz PT', 'Smith S']","['University of Michigan, Ann Abor, MI, USA.', 'Peking University, Haidian District, Beijing, China.', 'University of Michigan, Ann Abor, MI, USA.', 'Western Sydney University, Penrith, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20230811,United States,Clin Nurs Res,Clinical nursing research,9208508,,"['Humans', 'Adult', '*COVID-19', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Syndrome', 'Mental Health']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'long COVID', 'post-COVID condition', 'symptom cluster']",2023/08/11 06:42,2023/09/18 12:43,['2023/08/11 05:27'],"['2023/09/18 12:43 [medline]', '2023/08/11 06:42 [pubmed]', '2023/08/11 05:27 [entrez]']",['10.1177/10547738231191655 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Nurs Res. 2023 Nov;32(8):1071-1080. doi: 10.1177/10547738231191655.

Because DIBs exert a strong influence on social experience and behavior, they play an important role in a mental disorder's development and progression. To date, only the Interpersonal Cognitive Distortions Scale (ICDS) captures DIBs independently of specific disorders, populations, or contexts. The present study's aim was to psychometrically evaluate and validate a German translation of the ICDS. METHODS: The ICDS was administered along with indicators of convergent (rejection sensitivity, depressive expectations, interpersonal trust, interpersonal problems, perceived social support), discriminant (self-efficacy, perseverative negative thinking, optimism), and clinical validity (psychopathology, perceived stress, well-being) to a pooled sample incorporating non-clinical (N = 114) and clinical (N = 94) participants. RESULTS: An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) suggested a five-factor solution (factor loadings: .44 to .85). Correlational analyses demonstrated acceptable convergent (rho = -.29 to -.35, rho = .27 to .59), suboptimal discriminant (rho = -.27 to -.38, rho = .52), and acceptable clinical validity (rho = -.21, rho = .36 to .44) at the total-scale level. However, results at the subscale level were mixed and required nuanced interpretation. Likewise, internal consistency was acceptable at the total-scale level (alpha = .76), but ranged from good to poor at the subscale level (alpha = .61 to .80). DIBs mediated the negative relationship between mental disorder onset and psychopathology levels. DISCUSSION: Our results imply DIBs' relevance to mental health and related outcomes. When working with the ICDS's German version, we recommend employing only the ""insecurity"" subscale, as this was the only scale revealing acceptable psychometric properties. Future studies should improve the construct validity of the ICDS (and its subscales), e.g., by adding more items to the respective subscales and further classes of DIBs.","['Kirchner, Lukas', 'Kloft, Matthias', 'Arias Martin, Beatriz', 'Berg, Max', 'Anjedanimoghadamaraghi, Paria', 'Schafer, Leonora', 'Rief, Winfried']","['Kirchner L', 'Kloft M', 'Arias Martin B', 'Berg M', 'Anjedanimoghadamaraghi P', 'Schafer L', 'Rief W']","['Department of Psychology, Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Philipps-University of Marburg, Gutenbergstrasse 18, 35037, Marburg, Germany. lukas.kirchner@uni-marburg.de.', 'Department of Psychology, Psychological Methods, Philipps-University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Psychology, Psychological Diagnostics, Philipps-University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Psychology, Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Philipps-University of Marburg, Gutenbergstrasse 18, 35037, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Psychology, Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Philipps-University of Marburg, Gutenbergstrasse 18, 35037, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Psychology, Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Philipps-University of Marburg, Gutenbergstrasse 18, 35037, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Psychology, Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Philipps-University of Marburg, Gutenbergstrasse 18, 35037, Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20230927,England,BMC Psychiatry,BMC psychiatry,100968559,IM,"['Humans', '*Psychopathology', '*Cognitive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Mental Health', 'Optimism']",PMC10523705,,['NOTNLM'],"['Belief', 'Cognitive model', 'Expectation', 'Interpersonal risk factor', 'Mental health', 'Psychopathology']",2023/09/28 00:42,2023/09/29 06:44,['2023/09/27 23:45'],"['2022/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2023/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/09/29 06:44 [medline]', '2023/09/28 00:42 [pubmed]', '2023/09/27 23:45 [entrez]']","['10.1186/s12888-023-05155-3 [pii]', '5155 [pii]', '10.1186/s12888-023-05155-3 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Psychiatry. 2023 Sep 27;23(1):702. doi: 10.1186/s12888-023-05155-3.,1,,,"['This work was conducted as part of the cluster initiative ""The Adaptive Mind""', '(TAM) which brings together scientists from experimental psychology, clinical', 'psychology, and artificial intelligence to improve the understanding of how the', 'human mind successfully adapts to changing conditions.

This is a 3-day nationally devised training programme delivered via an innovative co-production model (i.e. co-delivery and partnership working with service users who have lived experience). This paper provides quantitative and qualitative information on the effectiveness of training delivery and also serves to provide some insight into the impact of service-user involvement via such a co-production model. Information on 162 participants using the Knowledge and Understanding Framework bespoke questionnaire (Personality Disorder Knowledge, Attitudes and Skills Questionnaire) suggests that the training can be effectively delivered by and within a local NHS Mental Health Trust. Results immediately post-training suggest an improvement in levels of understanding and capability efficacy and a reduction in negative emotional reactions. Indications from a 3-month follow-up suggest that while understanding and emotional reaction remain improved, capability efficacy regresses back to pre-training levels, suggesting the need for ongoing supervision and/or support to consolidate skills. Discussion includes guidelines for the implementation of a truly integrated co-production model of training provision, as well as advice relating to the maximization of long-term benefits.","['Davies, Julie', 'Sampson, Mark', 'Beesley, Frank', 'Smith, Debra', 'Baldwin, Victoria']","['Davies J', 'Sampson M', 'Beesley F', 'Smith D', 'Baldwin V']","['5 Boroughs Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Willis House, 23 Cumber Lane Prescot, Merseyside, L35 2YZ, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140227,England,Personal Ment Health,Personality and mental health,101473502,IM,"['England', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*education', 'Personality Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Program Evaluation', 'Qualitative Research', 'State Medicine', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,,,2014/02/28 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/02/28 06:00'],"['2013/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pmh.1257 [doi]'],ppublish,Personal Ment Health. 2014 May;8(2):161-8. doi: 10.1002/pmh.1257.

DESIGN AND SETTING: A total of 196 people aged 18 and over were selected, as a representative sample of the general population, from the electoral registers of Walsall and Dudley in the West Midlands. Respondents were interviewed in their own homes in the autumn of 1989. MEASUREMENTS: Open ended and structured questions were used to elicit concepts of health. The three main stages consisted of an unprompted section in which respondents were asked to describe the features of good or poor health in themselves or others; a prompted section in which they were asked to rate 37 health statements using a series of categories from ""very important"" to ""not at all important""; and a section in which they were asked to indicate which of six groups of statements, each representing a particular concept of health, best represented their own notions of health. RESULTS: Health was seen as multidimensional. Irrespective of whether respondents addressed health in self or health in others, or good or poor health, the biomedical dimension remained an important one. The manner by which concepts of health are elicited may provide some explanation as to why so many and varied concepts are alleged to be held by different subgroups of the population (notably different social classes). CONCLUSIONS: The differences found in this study between models of health employed by different subgroups of the general population have not been as great as has previously been suggested in the published reports.

Although studies to date have focused on the frequency of these impairments, fundamental questions remain unanswered regarding the survivor experience and the impact of the critical illness event on survivor resilience and recovery. OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between resilience and neuropsychological and physical function and to contextualize these findings within the survivors' recovery experience. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods pilot investigation of resilience among 43 survivors from two medical intensive care units (ICUs) within an academic health-care system. We interviewed survivors to identify barriers to and facilitators of recovery in the ICU, on the medical ward, and at home, using qualitative methods. We used a telephone battery of standardized tests to examine resilience, neuropsychological and physical function, and quality of life. We examined PICS in two ways. First, we identified how frequently survivors were impaired in one or more domains 6-12 months postdischarge. Second, we identified how frequently survivors reported that neuropsychological or physical function was worse. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Resilience was low in 28% of survivors, normal in 63% of survivors, and high in 9% of survivors. Resilience was inversely correlated with self-reported executive dysfunction, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, difficulty with self-care, and pain (P < 0.05). PICS was present in 36 survivors (83.7%; 95% confidence interval, 69.3-93.2%), whereas 23 survivors (53.5%; 95% confidence interval, 37.6-68.8%) reported worsening of neuropsychological or physical function after critical illness. We identified challenges along the recovery path of ICU survivors, finding that physical limitations and functional dependence were the most frequent challenges experienced in the ICU, medical ward, and on return to home. Spiritual and family support facilitated recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Resilience was inversely correlated with neuropsychological impairment, pain, and difficulty with self-care. PICS was present in most survivors of critical illness, and 54% reported neuropsychological or physical function to be worse, yet resilience was normal or high in most survivors. Survivors experienced many challenges during recovery, while spiritual and family support facilitated recovery.","['Maley, Jason H', 'Brewster, Isabel', 'Mayoral, Iris', 'Siruckova, Renata', 'Adams, Sarah', 'McGraw, Kelley A', 'Piech, Angela A', 'Detsky, Michael', 'Mikkelsen, Mark E']","['Maley JH', 'Brewster I', 'Mayoral I', 'Siruckova R', 'Adams S', 'McGraw KA', 'Piech AA', 'Detsky M', 'Mikkelsen ME']","['1 Department of Medicine.', '2 School of Nursing, University of Pennsylvania, and.', '2 School of Nursing, University of Pennsylvania, and.', '2 School of Nursing, University of Pennsylvania, and.', '2 School of Nursing, University of Pennsylvania, and.', '3 Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and.', '3 Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and.', '4 Interdivisional Department of Critical Care, University of Toronto, and.', '5 Division of Respirology, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital/University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '1 Department of Medicine.', '6 Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Division, Department of Medicine; and.', '7 Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],['R01 NR016014/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Ann Am Thorac Soc,Annals of the American Thoracic Society,101600811,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/*epidemiology', 'Critical Illness/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', '*Quality of Life', '*Resilience, Psychological', 'Self Report', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Syndrome']",PMC5021076,,['NOTNLM'],"['cognitive impairment', 'critical care', 'quality of life', 'resilience', 'survivorship']",2016/05/10 06:00,2018/01/11 06:00,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1513/AnnalsATS.201511-782OC [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2016 Aug;13(8):1351-60. doi: 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201511-782OC.,8,,['Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2016 Aug;13(8):1219-20.

To properly assist the users of these systems, a virtual agent needs to promote motivation. This can be done by offering motivational messages. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was two-fold. The first was to build a motivational message system for a virtual agent assisting in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) therapy based on domain knowledge from experts. The second was to test the hypotheses that (1) computer-generated motivating messages influence users' motivation to continue with therapy, trust in a good therapy outcome, and the feeling of being heard by the agent and (2) personalized messages outperform generic messages on these factors. METHODS: A system capable of generating motivational messages was built by analyzing expert (N=13) knowledge on what types of motivational statements to use in what situation. To test the 2 hypotheses, a Web-based study was performed (N=207). Participants were asked to imagine they were in a certain situation, specified by the progression of their symptoms and initial trust in a good therapy outcome. After this, they received a message from a virtual agent containing either personalized motivation as generated by the system, general motivation, or no motivational content. They were asked how this message changed their motivation to continue and trust in a good outcome as well as how much they felt they were being heard by the agent. RESULTS: Overall, findings confirmed the first hypothesis, as well as the second hypothesis for the measure feeling of being heard by the agent. Personalization of the messages was also shown to be important in those situations where the symptoms were getting worse. In these situations, personalized messages outperformed general messages both in terms of motivation to continue and trust in a good therapy outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Expert input can successfully be used to develop a personalized motivational message system. Messages generated by such a system seem to improve people's motivation and trust in PTSD therapy as well as the user's feeling of being heard by a virtual agent. Given the importance of motivation, trust, and therapeutic alliance for successful therapy, we anticipate that the proposed system can improve adherence in e-mental therapy for PTSD and that it can provide a blueprint for the development of an adaptive system for persuasive messages based on expert input.","['Tielman, Myrthe L', 'Neerincx, Mark A', 'Brinkman, Willem-Paul']","['Tielman ML', 'Neerincx MA', 'Brinkman WP']","['Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands.', 'Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands.', 'Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), Soesterberg, Netherlands.', 'Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190327,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*trends', '*Motivation', '*Persuasive Communication', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*psychology', 'Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy/*methods']",PMC6456821,,['NOTNLM'],"['PTSD', 'computer assisted therapy', 'mental health', 'motivation', 'trust', 'user-computer interface']",2019/03/28 06:00,2020/02/11 06:00,['2019/03/28 06:00'],"['2017/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['v21i3e9240 [pii]', '10.2196/jmir.9240 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2019 Mar 27;21(3):e9240. doi: 10.2196/jmir.9240.,3,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7826-5821', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8161-5722', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8485-7092']",,['Conflicts of Interest: None declared.'],"['(c)Myrthe L Tielman, Mark A Neerincx, Willem-Paul Brinkman.

The current cross-sectional study, conducted with 231 veterans, examines the relationship between socio-demographic features and both anxiety and depression in navy veterans after retirement. Spielberg's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used for anxiety assessment, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used for depression assessment. The analysis was performed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 20.0. RESULTS: It was found that the mean score of state anxiety was 41 and trait anxiety, 38. Severe depression was found in 6.5% of the veterans, moderate in 8.3% and mild in 21.7%. The presence of a serious health problems was an independent predictor of both anxiety and depression's more serious symptoms. Inversely, the stability in terms of retirement choice was negatively related to depression, while the development of new interests and activities after retirement was negatively related to both anxiety and depression. Further, life satisfaction after retirement was a predictor of lower current anxiety levels among veterans.","['Georgantas, Dimitris', 'Tsounis, Andreas', 'Vidakis, Ioannis', 'Malliarou, Maria', 'Sarafis, Pavlos']","['Georgantas D', 'Tsounis A', 'Vidakis I', 'Malliarou M', 'Sarafis P']","['Hellenic Open University, Patra, Greece.', 'School of Psychology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Hellenic Open University, Patra, Greece.', 'Faculty of Nursing, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Nursing, School of Health Sciences, Cyprus University of Technology, 15, Vragadinou Str, 3041, Limassol, Cyprus. pavlos.sarafis@cut.ac.cy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200303,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,IM,"['Aged', 'Anxiety Disorders/*psychology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depressive Disorder/*psychology', 'Female', 'Greece', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Military Personnel/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Retirement/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', '*Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Veterans/*psychology/statistics & numerical data']",PMC7055026,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anxiety', 'Depression', 'Navy', 'Retirement', 'Veterans']",2020/03/05 06:00,2020/11/24 06:00,['2020/03/05 06:00'],"['2019/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13104-020-04966-x [pii]', '4966 [pii]', '10.1186/s13104-020-04966-x [doi]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2020 Mar 3;13(1):122. doi: 10.1186/s13104-020-04966-x.,1,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9967-5152'],,['The authors report no declarations of interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nucleoside therapy improves or stabilizes disease across key outcomes including survival, ambulation, and requirement for mechanical ventilation. However, little is known about the effects of nucleoside therapy treatment of TK2d from the patient's perspective. This study sought to address this knowledge gap. Participants with TK2d and/or their parents/caregivers completed online surveys with standardized health measures and interviews. During interviews, participants rated and described TK2d's impact on 13 quality of life domains, changes since starting nucleoside therapy, and if they would recommend nucleoside therapy. Twenty-five individuals participated (17 adults with TK2d, 4 parent-participant pairs, 4 parents of children with TK2d). Adult participants with TK2d had clinically meaningfully worse scores than the general population on global physical and mental health, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, anxiety, and social function. Children's mobility and pain interference were significantly worse than the general pediatric population. Physical domains most affected by TK2d were: mobility (84%), fatigue (60%), respiratory function (56%), and hospitalizations (55%). Psychosocial domains most affected were: impact on family members (39%), mood (36%), and social life (28%). Most (77%) treated patients reported improvement; whereas, 67% in the untreated group reported worsening. All participants would recommend nucleoside therapy. In summary, TK2d has significant negative impacts on most areas of life and function. Measures of fatigue, sleep, swallowing/eating, speaking, and mood, should be considered as outcomes in clinical trials and research studies. Nucleoside therapy appears to provide meaningful improvements across many health domains affected by TK2d. SYNOPSIS: The consequences of having TK2d are devastating for both those with the disorder and their families; however, nucleoside therapy appears to provide meaningful improvements across many health domains affected by TK2d.","['Amtmann, Dagmar', 'Gammaitoni, Arnold R', 'Galer, Bradley S', 'Salem, Rana', 'Jensen, Mark P']","['Amtmann D', 'Gammaitoni AR', 'Galer BS', 'Salem R', 'Jensen MP']","['Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.

To explore whether these findings also apply to adolescents, 131 adolescent patients were recruited from a mental health care institute in The Netherlands. Axis I and Axis II disorders were diagnosed using semi-structured interviews. The EuroQol EQ-5D was used to measure quality of life and costs were measured by the Trimbos and Institute for Medical Technology Assessment Questionnaire on Costs Associated with Psychiatric Illness. The mean EQ-5D index value was 0.55. The mean direct medical cost in the year prior to treatment was euro14,032 per patient. The co-occurrence of Axis I and Axis II disorders was a significant predictor of a low quality of life. Direct medical costs were higher for the depressive personality disorder. This study shows that the burden of disease among adolescents with personality pathology is high. This high burden provides evidence to suggest that further research and development of (cost-)effective treatment strategies for this population may be worthwhile.","['Feenstra, Dine J', 'Hutsebaut, Joost', 'Laurenssen, Elisabeth M P', 'Verheul, Roel', 'Busschbach, Jan J V', 'Soeteman, Djora I']","['Feenstra DJ', 'Hutsebaut J', 'Laurenssen EM', 'Verheul R', 'Busschbach JJ', 'Soeteman DI']","['Viersprong Institute for Studies on Personality Disorders (VISPD), P.O.

METHODS: The methodology used in this qualitative inquiry is a descriptive phenomenological approach using Husserl's philosophical framework. Colaizzi's method was used for data analysis. FINDINGS: Analysis revealed seven themes: living in constant fear while deployed, combat has different meanings, bringing the war home, fear of being forever changed, disrespect from fellow military members, physical health-for better or worse, and combat has rewarding experiences. CONCLUSION: Early detection and assessment is crucial to providing interventions to military veterans to reduce the invisible wound of war, posttraumatic stress disorder, and ultimately increase the quality of life.","['Conard, Patricia', 'Scott-Tilley, Donna']","['Conard P', 'Scott-Tilley D']","['Texas A&M University, Corpus Christi, TX.', ""Texas Woman's University, Denton, TX.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140605,United States,Nurs Forum,Nursing forum,0401006,,"['Female', '*Gulf War', 'Humans', '*Life Change Events', 'Mental Health/standards', 'Military Personnel/psychology', 'Qualitative Research', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/psychology', 'Veterans/*psychology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Psychiatric/mental health', 'nursing research', ""women's health""]",2014/06/06 06:00,2017/02/14 06:00,['2014/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/nuf.12097 [doi]'],ppublish,Nurs Forum. 2015 Oct-Dec;50(4):228-40. doi: 10.1111/nuf.12097.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate longitudinally the relationship between religious struggle with an illness and mortality. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study from 1996 to 1997 was conducted to assess positive religious coping and religious struggle, and demographic, physical health, and mental health measures at baseline as control variables. Mortality during the 2-year period was the main outcome measure. Participants were 596 patients aged 55 years or older on the medical inpatient services of Duke University Medical Center or the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Durham, NC. RESULTS: After controlling for the demographic, physical health, and mental health variables, higher religious struggle scores at baseline were predictive of greater risk of mortality (risk ratio [RR] for death, 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.11; chi(2) = 5.89; P =.02). Two spiritual discontent items and 1 demonic reappraisal item from the religious coping measure were predictive of increased risk for mortality: ""Wondered whether God had abandoned me"" (RR for death, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.07-1.50; chi(2) = 5.22; P =.02), ""Questioned God's love for me"" (RR for death, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02-1.43; chi(2) = 3.69; P =.05), and ""Decided the devil made this happen"" (RR for death, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.05-1.33; chi(2) = 5.84; P =.02). CONCLUSIONS: Certain forms of religiousness may increase the risk of death. Elderly ill men and women who experience a religious struggle with their illness appear to be at increased risk of death, even after controlling for baseline health, mental health status, and demographic factors.","['Pargament, K I', 'Koenig, H G', 'Tarakeshwar, N', 'Hahn, J']","['Pargament KI', 'Koenig HG', 'Tarakeshwar N', 'Hahn J']","['Department of Psychology, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH 43403, USA. kpargam@bgnet.bgsu.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Aged', 'Disease/*psychology', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Religion', 'Stress, Psychological/*mortality']",,,,,2001/08/30 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['ioi00736 [pii]', '10.1001/archinte.161.15.1881 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 2001 Aug 13-27;161(15):1881-5. doi: 10.1001/archinte.161.15.1881.,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate how responsible the ethno-religious origins are, for the prevalence of trauma exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in displaced Iraqi asylum-seekers and refugees residing in the Iraqi Kurdistan region. METHODS: Structured interviews with a cross-sectional sample of 150 individuals, comprised of three self-identified ethno-religious groups (50 participants in each): Christians, Muslims, and Yazidis. RESULTS: 100% prevalence of trauma exposure and 48.7% of current PTSD among refugees, 70% PTSD rate of Yazidi participants, which is significantly higher (p < 0.01) compared to 44% of Muslim participants and 32% of Christian participants.

When Canada ratified the CRPD, it reserved the right to continue using substitute decision making schemes even if the CRPD was 'interpreted as requiring their elimination'. This was a prescient decision because the CRPD Committee, which is tasked with overseeing the interpretation and implementation of the CRPD, subsequently opined that all legislation supporting substitute decision making schemes contravene the CRPD and must be revoked. The CRPD Committee insists that every person can make decisions with sufficient support and that if a person lacks capacity to make a decision, we must rely on their 'will and preferences'. Many international legal scholars have called this interpretation unrealistic. We agree and, in this article, describe how this unrealistic approach would result in extensive harm and suffering for people with severe cognitive or psychotic disorders. The reader should also be aware that the CRPD Committee also calls for the elimination of all mental health acts and the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights for the abandonment of the not criminally responsible (NCR) defence.","['Dufour, Mathieu', 'Hastings, Thomas', ""O'Reilly, Richard""]","['Dufour M', 'Hastings T', ""O'Reilly R""]","['Department of Psychiatry, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario.', 'Associate Chief (Ottawa), Royal Ottawa Health Care Group, Ottawa, Ontario.', 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario.', 'Lecturer, Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario.', 'Department of Psychiatry at Western University, London, Ontario.', 'Northern Ontario School of Medicine, Ontario.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180620,United States,Can J Psychiatry,Canadian journal of psychiatry.

How, and why, has grief theory evolved within the discipline of psychology in this way? In what ways do these changes in the understanding of grief coincide with other historical developments within the discipline? In this article, I trace the development of grief, originally conceived by Freud within a psychoanalytic and nonpathological framework, to the current conceptualization of grief within the disease model.

Resilience is a term used within social work, psychology, and health professions to indicate positive adaptation to adversity, trauma, or stress. This article examines traditional and alternative models of resilience through analyses of quantitative and qualitative data from an evaluation of a year-long empowerment program for 33 Black girls (mean age = 14.97 years). Based on critical consciousness theory and Black feminism, this program was designed to empower participants through critical reflection and development of positive gendered racial identity. Quantitative analyses found no change over time in traditional measures of individual resilience. However, alternative measures of collective resilience show positive change. Specifically, quantitative analyses reveal that participants developed increased awareness of structural inequalities faced by Black girls/women and decreased adherence to neoliberal ideologies of personal responsibility and individual striving. Additionally, qualitative analyses show that participants critically reflected on their experiences of oppression, developed mutual support and positive gendered racial identity, and engaged in collective action.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impacts of menopause status and hormone intervention on women's health. METHODS: In an ongoing, population-based study, 4943 women, born 1935 to 1945 and living in the Lund area of Southern Sweden, were included in this analysis. They completed a generic questionnaire pertaining to socio-demographic background and current health-related symptoms. Among the cohort, 9% of women were pre-menopausal (PM), 52% were post-menopausal without hormone replacement therapy (PMO) and 39% were current hormone replacement therapy users (PMT). RESULTS: Hot flushes and vaginal dryness were strongly related to menopausal status. The prevalence of somatic symptoms worsened progressively from the groups of PM to PMO to PMT. The most abundant complaints were headache and muscle-skeletal-joint problems. A total of 85% of women experienced psychological problems. Contrary to our expectation, a poorer profile of psychological health was found in the PMT group when compared with the PMO group. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of symptoms in middle-aged women could be attributed to age, hormonal influence as well as personality.","['Li, Cairu', 'Wilawan, Kittisak', 'Samsioe, Goran', 'Lidfeldt, Jonas', 'Agardh, Carl-David', 'Nerbrand, Christina']","['Li C', 'Wilawan K', 'Samsioe G', 'Lidfeldt J', 'Agardh CD', 'Nerbrand C']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lund University Hospital, S-221 85 Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,IM,"['Behavior', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Menopause/physiology', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Prevalence', 'Sweden', ""*Women's Health""]",,,,,2002/05/01 10:00,2002/10/11 04:00,['2002/05/01 10:00'],"['2002/05/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/05/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/humrep/17.5.1379 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2002 May;17(5):1379-85. doi: 10.1093/humrep/17.5.1379.,5,,,,,,,,['Hum Reprod. 2003 Jan;18(1):222.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This constellation of problems is known as 'postintensive care syndrome' (PICS) and may persist for months and/or years. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify the scope and magnitude of physical problems associated with PICS during the first year after discharge from ICU, using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework to elucidate the impairments of body functions and structures, activity limitations and participation restrictions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Medline (Ovid), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid), PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science and EMBASE will be systematically searched for observational studies reporting the physical impairments of body functions and structures, activity limitations and participation restrictions associated with PICS. Two reviewers will assess the articles for eligibility according to prespecified selection criteria, after which an independent reviewer will perform data extraction which will be validated by a second independent reviewer. Quality appraisal will be performed by two independent reviewers. Outcomes of the included studies will be summarised in tables and in narrative format and meta-analyses will be conducted where appropriate. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Formal ethical approval is not required as no primary data is collected. This systematic review will identify the scope and magnitude of physical problems associated with PICS during the first year after discharge from ICU and will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication and at conference meetings, to inform practice and future research on the physical problems associated with PICS.

The post-intensive care syndrome framework encompassing these multidimensional morbidities was developed at the 2010 Society of Critical Care Medicine conference on improving long-term outcomes after critical illness for survivors and their families. OBJECTIVES: To report on engagement with non-critical care providers and survivors during the 2012 Society of Critical Care Medicine post-intensive care syndrome stakeholder conference. Task groups developed strategies and resources required for raising awareness and education, understanding and addressing barriers to clinical practice, and identifying research gaps and resources, aimed at improving patient and family outcomes. PARTICIPANTS: Representatives from 21 professional associations or health systems involved in the provision of both critical care and rehabilitation of ICU survivors in the United States and ICU survivors and family members. DESIGN: Stakeholder consensus meeting. Researchers presented summaries on morbidities for survivors and their families, whereas survivors presented their own experiences. MEETING OUTCOMES: Future steps were planned regarding 1) recognizing, preventing, and treating post-intensive care syndrome, 2) building strategies for institutional capacity to support and partner with survivors and families, and 3) understanding and addressing barriers to practice. There was recognition of the need for systematic and frequent assessment for post-intensive care syndrome across the continuum of care, including explicit ""functional reconciliation"" (assessing gaps between a patient's pre-ICU and current functional ability at all intra- and interinstitutional transitions of care). Future post-intensive care syndrome research topic areas were identified across the continuum of recovery: characterization of at-risk patients (including recognizing risk factors, mechanisms of injury, and optimal screening instruments), prevention and treatment interventions, and outcomes research for patients and families. CONCLUSIONS: Raising awareness of post-intensive care syndrome for the public and both critical care and non-critical care clinicians will inform a more coordinated approach to treatment and support during recovery after critical illness. Continued conceptual development and engagement with additional stakeholders is required.","['Elliott, Doug', 'Davidson, Judy E', 'Harvey, Maurene A', 'Bemis-Dougherty, Anita', 'Hopkins, Ramona O', 'Iwashyna, Theodore J', 'Wagner, Jason', 'Weinert, Craig', 'Wunsch, Hannah', 'Bienvenu, O Joseph', 'Black, Gary', 'Brady, Susan', 'Brodsky, Martin B', 'Deutschman, Cliff', 'Doepp, Diana', 'Flatley, Carl', 'Fosnight, Sue', 'Gittler, Michelle', 'Gomez, Belkys Teresa', 'Hyzy, Robert', 'Louis, Deborah', 'Mandel, Ruth', 'Maxwell, Carol', 'Muldoon, Sean R', 'Perme, Christiane S', 'Reilly, Cynthia', 'Robinson, Marla R', 'Rubin, Eileen', 'Schmidt, David M', 'Schuller, Jessica', 'Scruth, Elizabeth', 'Siegal, Eric', 'Spill, Gayle R', 'Sprenger, Sharon', 'Straumanis, John P', 'Sutton, Pat', 'Swoboda, Sandy M', 'Twaddle, Martha L', 'Needham, Dale M']","['Elliott D', 'Davidson JE', 'Harvey MA', 'Bemis-Dougherty A', 'Hopkins RO', 'Iwashyna TJ', 'Wagner J', 'Weinert C', 'Wunsch H', 'Bienvenu OJ', 'Black G', 'Brady S', 'Brodsky MB', 'Deutschman C', 'Doepp D', 'Flatley C', 'Fosnight S', 'Gittler M', 'Gomez BT', 'Hyzy R', 'Louis D', 'Mandel R', 'Maxwell C', 'Muldoon SR', 'Perme CS', 'Reilly C', 'Robinson MR', 'Rubin E', 'Schmidt DM', 'Schuller J', 'Scruth E', 'Siegal E', 'Spill GR', 'Sprenger S', 'Straumanis JP', 'Sutton P', 'Swoboda SM', 'Twaddle ML', 'Needham DM']","['1Faculty of Health, University of Technology Sydney, NSW, Australia. 2EBP and Research Nurse Liaison, UCSD Medical Center, San Diego, CA. 3Department of Clinical Practice, American Physical Therapy Association, Alexandria, VA. 4Pulmonary and Critical Care Division, Intermountain Medical Center, Murray, UT. 5Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT. 6Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI. 7Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. 8Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN. 9Department of Anesthesia and Epidemiology, Columbia University, New York, NY. 10Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. 11Swallowing and Voice Center at Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, Wheaton, IL. 12Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. 13Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care and Surgery, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. 14Illinois Chapter, American Case Management Association, Chicago, IL. 15Sepsis Alliance, San Diego, CA. 16Summa Health System/Pharmacy Practice, Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED), Akron, OH. 17Division of Orthopedic Surgery and Rehabilitation, Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. 18Department of Standards and Survey Methods, Division of Healthcare Quality Evaluation, The Joint Commission, Washington, D.C. 19Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. 20Critical Care and Respiratory Care, Kaiser Westside Medical Center, Hillsboro, OR. 21Department of Care Management/Social Services, NorthShore University Health System, Evanston, IL. 22Society for Social Work Leadership in Health Care, Social Work Arkan']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,IM,"['Awareness', 'Continuity of Patient Care/*organization & administration', 'Critical Illness/*psychology', 'Health Education', '*Health Status', 'Humans', '*Intensive Care Units', 'Mental Health', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Syndrome', 'United States']",,,,,2014/08/02 06:00,2015/01/24 06:00,['2014/08/02 06:00'],"['2014/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCM.0000000000000525 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Med. 2014 Dec;42(12):2518-26. doi: 10.1097/CCM.0000000000000525.,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research on the separation of positive and negative affect represents a major empirical development of this view. The present study supports the model as it has been developed from people's self-reports. However, the postulation of complete separation of positive and negative affect is too extreme for others' reports about people. For others' reports, the model should be modified to state that positive and negative affect are partially separate and have differentially strong associations with harmonious and disruptive/distressing behaviors. These findings have implications for the measurement of psychological well-being in investigations of the physically ill. Both psychological impairment and psychological health should be represented, particularly when they are assessed from people's self-reports. Finally, there are promising indications that this view of psychological well-being is applicable to mentally ill persons as well.","['Fontana, A F', 'Marcus, J L', 'Dowds, B N', 'Hughes, L A']","['Fontana AF', 'Marcus JL', 'Dowds BN', 'Hughes LA']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Psychosom Med,Psychosomatic medicine,0376505,IM,"['Affect', 'Attitude to Health', 'Disease/*psychology', 'Employment', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*psychology', '*Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Psychological', 'Social Adjustment']",,,,,1980/03/01 00:00,1980/03/01 00:01,['1980/03/01 00:00'],"['1980/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006842-198003000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychosom Med. 1980 Mar;42(2):279-88. doi: 10.1097/00006842-198003000-00005.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meta-analytically combining these studies revealed a Likelihood Ratio of 1.14, indicating a small but significant effect. Higher levels of emotional well-being are beneficial for recovery and survival in physically ill patients. The findings show that emotional well-being predicts long-term prognosis of physical illness. This suggests that enhancement of emotional well-being may improve the prognosis of physical illness, which should be investigated by future research.","['Lamers, Sanne M A', 'Bolier, Linda', 'Westerhof, Gerben J', 'Smit, Filip', 'Bohlmeijer, Ernst T']","['Lamers SM', 'Bolier L', 'Westerhof GJ', 'Smit F', 'Bohlmeijer ET']","['Psychology, Health and Technology, University of Twente, P.O.

Implications are drawn for both community care policy, which needs to focus upon the impact on the carer of continuing to provide care at home, and for health research relating to older women, which has ignored the demands of caring among older people.","['Rosenman, L', 'Le Brocque, R', 'Carr, S']","['Rosenman L', 'Le Brocque R', 'Carr S']","['Department of Social Work and Social Policy, University of Queensland, Brisbane.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Aust J Public Health,Australian journal of public health,9105166,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', '*Caregivers', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Home Nursing', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Queensland', 'Rural Health', 'Stress, Physiological/physiopathology', 'Urban Health', ""*Women's Health""]",,,,,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1753-6405.1994.tb00279.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust J Public Health. 1994 Dec;18(4):440-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1753-6405.1994.tb00279.x.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the next 9 weeks, the subjects kept records concerning their physical health (e.g., ailments, doctor visits, medication usage), and at the end of that period they completed forms that measured psychologic symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, alienation). Multiple regression analyses revealed that a high level of life stress during the preceding year was related to poorer subsequent physical health for subjects with a low level of fitness in particular. Life stress was found to have little impact on the subsequent physical health of fit subjects. Similar results were found for depression.

In order to enhance the possibilities to prevent such crimes it is essential to determine factors that condition this kind of sexual behavior. AIM: The aim of the study was to prepare a multidimensional analysis of a profile of sexual offenders against minors. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A detailed analysis of documentation from forensic sexological, psychiatric and psychological examinations and information from the records of the proceedings concerning 257 perpetrators was performed by the authors. Information analyzed included demographic data, psychosocial background, psychosexual development, recent sexual activity, physical and mental health issues and information concerning accused sexual crime. RESULTS: The majority of the offenders had undisturbed family relations. However, subjects with sexual preference disorders perceived their parents' relationship as worse, reported more difficulties in educational process and in relation to teachers and peers. 5.4% of subjects experienced sexual abuse and 23.3% physical violence in their childhood. The majority reported no sexual dysfunction and had regular but rare sexual activity. 20.6% were diagnosed as having mental disorder and 36.8% were alcohol abusers. Almost 30% were under influence of alcohol or another substance during the crime. The majority had no sexual preference disorder. Definite pedophilia was found in 27% and traits of psychosexual immaturity in 23.1% of cases. There was no relationship between sexual preference disorders and psychiatric comorbidity, alcohol or substance abuse. The acts of sexual abuse comprised genital touching, vaginal or oral intercourse as well as exposing offender's or victim's body. These acts were typically against one child, planned, being aware of victim's age and using physical violence. CONCLUSIONS: The data from our research should be taken into account when planning therapeutic and preventive interventions.","['Heitzman, Janusz', 'Lew-Starowicz, Michal', 'Pacholski, Marek', 'Lew-Starowicz, Zbigniew']","['Heitzman J', 'Lew-Starowicz M', 'Pacholski M', 'Lew-Starowicz Z']",,['pol'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Psychiatr Pol,Psychiatria polska,0103314,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child Abuse, Sexual/*statistics & numerical data', 'Crime Victims/classification/*statistics & numerical data', 'Criminals/*classification/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Forensic Psychiatry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*classification/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Pedophilia/epidemiology', 'Personality', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology']",,,,,2014/06/21 06:00,2014/09/05 06:00,['2014/06/21 06:00'],"['2014/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Psychiatr Pol. 2014 Jan-Feb;48(1):105-20.,1,,,,,"Wykorzystywanie seksualne dzieci w Polsce--analiza badan 257 sprawcow, ktorzy popelnili przestepstwa seksualne wobec maloletnich.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: The analysis of the clinical case and medical history. RESULTS: The presented 62-year-old women with a history of previous psychiatric disorder arrived with her husband to Jerusalem as a part of organised touristic group. She developed acute psychotic reaction through some stages characteristic for the third type of Jerusalem syndrome. Symptoms resolved completely soon after returning to Poland and admission to the hospital where an antipsychotic treatment was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the rare occurrence of this phenomenon, it is worth noting that we can divide Jerusalem syndrome into three types depending on its clinical course, patient's history of previous psychiatric disorders and this division has some clinical implications. This syndrome can be also considered in the context of some factors connected with travelling in general which may be responsible for psychiatric disturbances occurring among travelers. The course of psychiatric disturbances in the presented patient resembled the third type of Jerusalem syndrome despite her past psychiatric history and probably travelling caused her decompensations. In clinical practice we have to remember that in case of the patients with a known psychiatric history, clinical evaluation may be useful before travelling. In previously healthy patients developing the third type of the Jerusalem syndrome early intervention and separation from Jerusalem and its holy places and their contact with family are crucial for soon recovery.","['Poleszczyk, Anna', 'Swiecicki, Lukasz']","['Poleszczyk A', 'Swiecicki L']","['II Klinika Psychiatryczna, IPiN w Warszawie Kierownik.']",['pol'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Psychiatr Pol,Psychiatria polska,0103314,IM,"['Antipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Israel', '*Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychotic Disorders/*diagnosis/drug therapy/psychology', 'Religion', '*Religion and Psychology', 'Syndrome', 'Travel']",,,,,2013/07/31 06:00,2013/08/24 06:00,['2013/07/30 06:00'],"['2013/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Psychiatr Pol. 2013 Mar-Apr;47(2):353-60.,2,,,,,Syndrom jerozolimski - opis przypadku.,,['0 (Antipsychotic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children's divorce was rated as the most serious negative LE; the most common positive LE were travel and birth of a grandchild, but recovery from disease was ranked highest. Despite the predominance of negative LE, QL scores improved both in a representative population sample that was given support in the form of a medical-social intervention for 2 years, and in a control sample that underwent the identical systematical health surveys but received no further active help. As the study did not demonstrate any differences in outcome measurement (QL) between the supported subjects and the controls, it was not possible to discern whether the retained well-being could be attributed the intervention as was hypothesized.","['Grimby, A', 'Svanborg, A']","['Grimby A', 'Svanborg A']","['Department of Geriatric Medicine, Goteborg University, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Aging (Milano),"Aging (Milan, Italy)",9102503,IM,"['Aged', 'Aging/*psychology', 'Anxiety', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease', 'Divorce', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Life Change Events', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Personal Satisfaction', '*Quality of Life', 'Self Concept', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,,,1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03339672 [doi]'],ppublish,Aging (Milano). 1996 Jun;8(3):162-9. doi: 10.1007/BF03339672.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I focus on the public outcry over a violent crime committed by a repeat sexual offender, Earl Shriner, and show how the act was drafted in direct response to this outcry. Following his arrest, there was a public discussion of a) whether the state had a responsibility to cure individuals like Shriner before releasing them, and b) whether sex offenders could be cured at all. The WCPA was a landmark law because it shifted forensic psychology in the use of sexual criminals from an intervention model to a containment model, from a model that sought to separate out those sexual criminals who could be treated to a model that separated out sexual criminals because they could not be treated. I demonstrate here that this shift was made in response to the representation of Earl Shriner as a member of a group classified by legislators as having a coherent, recognizable and untreatable mental disorder that caused them to commit acts of sexual violence.","['Cipolla, Cyd']",['Cipolla C'],"['Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA. cyd.cipolla@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Med Humanit,The Journal of medical humanities,8917478,IM,"['Forensic Psychiatry/*statistics & numerical data', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', '*Knowledge', 'Mental Disorders/*classification/psychology', 'Mental Health/*classification/statistics & numerical data', 'Prejudice', 'Prisoners/history', 'Prisons/history', 'Sex Offenses/*classification/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Social Perception', 'Violence/*classification/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Washington']",,,,,2011/01/13 06:00,2011/09/14 06:00,['2011/01/13 06:00'],"['2011/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10912-010-9134-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Humanit. 2011 Jun;32(2):103-13. doi: 10.1007/s10912-010-9134-0.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the beginning of the 1970s, contributors to the literature of transcultural psychiatry in Germany have been predominantly concerned with the mental health of migrant workers from Mediterranean countries, particularly the practical difficulties and therapeutic implications of inpatient psychiatric treatment of these migrant groups. The inauguration of the Section on Transcultural Psychiatry of the German Association for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy 20 years ago reflected an increasing scientific interest in this topic. In addition to the psychic impact of migration, research into transcultural care is currently focused on disparities in the utilization of health care and conjectured barriers to access to health and mental health care among migrants. Furthermore, studies based on epidemiological approaches have been carried out in order to resolve the question of whether migrants are as affected by mental disorders as the ethnic German population, and which issues contribute to the so-called ""healthy migrant"" effect. Other topics that have been explored in the last 10 years are the particular psychosocial situation of asylum seekers and refugees in Germany, and the effects of inadequate integration and discrimination on their mental health. In summary, after a short historical and theoretical overview, this article reviews the current major themes in transcultural research in German contemporary psychiatry, and concludes with an overview of future developments in this field.","['Machleidt, Wielant', 'Sieberer, Marcel']","['Machleidt W', 'Sieberer M']",['Hannover Medical School.'],['eng'],,"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",20131024,England,Transcult Psychiatry,Transcultural psychiatry,9708119,IM,"['Asia, Southeastern/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Biomedical Research/*history/methods', '*Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Ethnopsychology/*history', 'Germany/epidemiology/ethnology', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/ethnology/*history', 'Transients and Migrants/*history/psychology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Germany', 'Kraepelin', 'mental health', 'migrants', 'transcultural psychiatry']",2013/10/26 06:00,2015/10/24 06:00,['2013/10/26 06:00'],"['2013/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1363461513508597 [pii]', '10.1177/1363461513508597 [doi]']",ppublish,Transcult Psychiatry. 2013 Dec;50(6):817-40. doi: 10.1177/1363461513508597.

The weighted prevalence of severe depression (PHQ-9 >/= 20) was 4.7%, possible anxiety disorder (OASIS >/= 8) was 30.9%, possible post-traumatic stress disorder (PCL-C >/= 50) was 10.8%, and past year suicide attempt was 1.9%.

Besides with its relational perspective, it centers on the primacy of core relationships and its influence on a woman's mental health. Even though, since its inception three decades ago, the theory has been studied in relation to various psychological and physical disorders; it has hitherto received inadequate attention by scholars. Nonetheless, it has the potential to inform our understanding when formulating women's mental health issues.

The sample consists of 1029 children and adolescents aged 11-17 years. Of them, 533 (51.8%) were female and 496 (48.2%) were male. War-traumatic events were measured using the War-Traumatic Events Checklist (W-TECh). Violence was derived from the Multicultural Events Schedule for Adolescents (M.E.S.A.) containing three domains: violence at home, violence in the neighbourhood, and violence at school. Emotional and behavioural problems were measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Posttraumatic Stress Disorder was measured using the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders Symptoms Scale (PTSDSS). Finally, depression symptoms were measured by the Depression scale. Around two thirds of the children (64.5%, N = 665) reported that they were exposed to violence at home, 48.2% (N = 497) to violence in the neighbourhood, 78.2% (N = 806) to violence at school. In addition, boys significantly showed more exposure to violence compared to girls. Moreover, the prevalence of PTSD according to DSM-5 is 53.5% (N = 549). The results also showed that cumulative effect of exposure to violence in more contexts (political war trauma, violence at home, neighbourhood and/or school) predicted higher levels of PTSD, social and emotional problems, depression, and overall mental health problems amongst children. Cumulative exposure to violence may increase the propensity of developing mental health problems such as PTSD, emotional and behavioural problems, and depression symptoms and thus interventions should be targeted to these populations.","['El-Khodary, Basel', 'Samara, Muthanna']","['El-Khodary B', 'Samara M']","['Department of Psychology, Kingston University London, Penrhyn Road, Kingston upon Thames, KT1 2EE, UK.

BACKGROUND: Anecdotal evidence suggests that urban design features could have a positive impact on the mental well-being of individuals suffering from PTSD. However, evidence-based architectural and space design guidelines for PTSD are largely absent. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 veterans diagnosed with PTSD to gain insights into their personal experiences with physical indoor and outdoor spaces, and to inquire about their needs and expectations for future architectural design. Transcripts were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Architectural design features including windows, entrances and exits, walkways and hallways, open space, defensible space, and green space; interior design features including furnishings and color; and ambient features including light, air quality, and noise levels were identified as most influential design features. CONCLUSIONS: Our results underscore the first important step to developing comprehensive architectural and space design guidelines for veterans with PTSD.

Yet the effects of preeclampsia on mental health are often overlooked, effects which can be evident both immediately postpartum and decades later. In particular, preeclampsia has been associated with increased risk and severity of cognitive impairment, psychosocial distress, and psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. While these outcomes are reported, few have proposed how the pathophysiology of preeclampsia may contribute to changes in postpartum mental health. Studies have suggested that anti-angiogenic factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines released from the preeclamptic placenta may damage the blood-brain barrier endothelium, leading to long-term structural and functional cerebral changes. These changes may contribute to subsequent impairments in mental health. In addition, the pro-inflammatory profile and patterns of cerebral damage observed in preeclampsia are similar to that of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment, suggesting they may share common mechanisms. Yet, there is limited evidence on how these mechanisms may interact. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence for these pathophysiological mechanisms and propose how they may work synergistically to affect brain structure, cognition, and postpartum mental health in preeclampsia. The role of psychosocial factors, disease severity, and psychological treatment in the mental health of preeclampsia patients will also be discussed.","['Srajer, Amelia', 'Johnson, Jo-Ann', 'Yusuf, Kamran']","['Srajer A', 'Johnson JA', 'Yusuf K']","['Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.', 'Section of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.', 'Section of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210919,England,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",101136916,IM,"['Pregnancy', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Pre-Eclampsia', 'Mental Health', 'Postpartum Period', 'Anxiety', 'Placenta']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Preeclampsia', 'anti-angiogenic factors', 'blood-brain barrier', 'mental health', 'pro-inflammatory cytokines']",2021/09/21 06:00,2022/11/24 06:00,['2021/09/20 05:28'],"['2021/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/11/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/20 05:28 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14767058.2021.1978067 [doi]'],ppublish,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med. 2022 Dec;35(25):8443-8449. doi: 10.1080/14767058.2021.1978067.

It is a crisis of its diagnostic systems despite - perhaps because - of the recurrent claims about the extent of diagnosable 'brain disorders'. It is a crisis of its explanatory systems despite - perhaps because - of its current wager on the brain as the ultimate locus for explanations of mental disorders. It is a crisis of its therapeutic capacities despite - perhaps because - more and more people are making use of its primary mode of intervention focussed on the brain - psychiatric drugs. In this editorial, I will suggest that this triple crisis of diagnosis, explanation and therapeutics arises from the dominant reductionist approaches to the role of neurobiology in psychiatry that priorities the analysis of brain mechanisms, at the expense of an understanding of the whole living organism in its milieu, and the processes which social experience shapes neurobiology from the moment of conception if not before. I shall suggest a different approach that starts from the experience of persons coping with adversity in their forms of life. This approach does not require giving up on our search for plausible explanations of mental health problems that engage neurobiological mechanisms, but it begins from a commitment to understanding, and hence intervening in, the ways in which social adversity shapes and blights the lives of so many of our fellow citizens.","['Rose, N']",['Rose N'],"[""Department of Social Science,Health and Medicine,King's College London,UK.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150803,England,Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences,101561091,IM,"['Humans', '*Mental Disorders', 'Mental Health/*trends', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences/*trends', 'Psychiatry']",PMC6998666,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cognitive neuroscience', 'diagnosis and classification', 'epidemiology', 'social and political issues', 'stressful life events']",2015/08/04 06:00,2018/09/11 06:00,['2015/08/04 06:00'],"['2015/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S2045796015000621 [pii]', '00062 [pii]', '10.1017/S2045796015000621 [doi]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci. 2016 Apr;25(2):95-100. doi: 10.1017/S2045796015000621.

In this study we examine associations between mental health problems and life satisfaction in a birth cohort studied from 18 to 35 years. METHOD: Data were gathered during the Christchurch Health and Development Study, which is a longitudinal study of a birth cohort of 1265 children, born in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1977. Assessments of psychiatric disorder (major depression, anxiety disorder, suicidality, alcohol dependence and illicit substance dependence) using DSM diagnostic criteria and life satisfaction were obtained at 18, 21, 25, 30 and 35 years. RESULTS: Significant associations (p < 0.01) were found between repeated measures of life satisfaction and the psychiatric disorders major depression, anxiety disorder, suicidality, alcohol dependence and substance dependence. After adjustment for non-observed sources of confounding by fixed effects, statistically significant associations (p < 0.05) remained between life satisfaction and major depression, anxiety disorder, suicidality and substance dependence. Overall, those reporting three or more mental health disorders had mean life satisfaction scores that were nearly 0.60 standard deviations below those without mental health problems. A structural equation model examined the direction of causation between life satisfaction and mental health problems. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) reciprocal associations were found between life satisfaction and mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for confounding, robust and reciprocal associations were found between mental health problems and life satisfaction. Overall, this study showed evidence that life satisfaction influences mental disorder, and that mental disorder influences life satisfaction.","['Fergusson, D M', 'McLeod, G F H', 'Horwood, L J', 'Swain, N R', 'Chapple, S', 'Poulton, R']","['Fergusson DM', 'McLeod GF', 'Horwood LJ', 'Swain NR', 'Chapple S', 'Poulton R']","['Christchurch Health and Development Study,Department of Psychological Medicine,University of Otago,Christchurch,New Zealand.', 'Christchurch Health and Development Study,Department of Psychological Medicine,University of Otago,Christchurch,New Zealand.', 'Christchurch Health and Development Study,Department of Psychological Medicine,University of Otago,Christchurch,New Zealand.', 'Department of Psychological Medicine,Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago,Dunedin,New Zealand.', 'Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Research Unit,Department of Preventive and Social Medicine,Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago,Dunedin,New Zealand.', 'Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Research Unit,Department of Preventive and Social Medicine,Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago,Dunedin,New Zealand.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150325,England,Psychol Med,Psychological medicine,1254142,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alcoholism/*diagnosis', 'Anxiety Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Depressive Disorder, Major/*diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Models, Structural', 'New Zealand', '*Personal Satisfaction', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Risk Factors', 'Suicidal Ideation', 'Suicide, Attempted', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fixed-effects regression', 'life satisfaction', 'longitudinal studies', 'mental health', 'structural equation modelling']",2015/03/26 06:00,2016/04/15 06:00,['2015/03/26 06:00'],"['2015/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0033291715000422 [pii]', '10.1017/S0033291715000422 [doi]']",ppublish,Psychol Med. 2015 Aug;45(11):2427-36. doi: 10.1017/S0033291715000422.

No systematic review of strengths assessments for use within mental health populations has been published. The aims of this study were to describe and evaluate strengths assessments for use within mental health services. A systematic review identified 12 strengths assessments (5 quantitative, 7 qualitative). The Strengths Assessment Worksheet (SAW) was the most widely utilized and evaluated qualitative assessment. Psychometric properties of the assessments were assessed against set quality criteria. Data on psychometric properties were available for 4 measures. The Client Assessment of Strengths, Interests and Goals (CASIG) had the strongest psychometric evidence. The SAW and CASIG assessments can be tentatively recommended within clinical practice, although the evidence for all strengths assessments is currently limited. To describe the content of the strengths assessment, the items used to operationalize the concept of strengths in each assessment were extracted and themed. Twenty-four themes were identified and organized into 3 overarching categories: individual factors, environmental factors, and interpersonal factors. These categories form the basis of an empirically based definition of strengths that could be used as a conceptual foundation for new clinical assessments.","['Bird, Victoria J', 'Le Boutillier, Clair', 'Leamy, Mary', 'Larsen, John', 'Oades, Lindsay G', 'Williams, Julie', 'Slade, Mike']","['Bird VJ', 'Le Boutillier C', 'Leamy M', 'Larsen J', 'Oades LG', 'Williams J', 'Slade M']","[""Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, London, England.

Current research and treatment models of social phobia rely on categorical diagnostic conceptualizations lacking empirical support. This study aims to further research exploring whether social phobia is best conceptualized as a dimension or a discrete categorical disorder. METHODS: This study used three distinct taxometric techniques (mean above minus below a cut, maximum Eigen value and latent mode) to explore the latent structure of social phobia in two large epidemiological samples, using indicators derived from diagnostic criteria and associated avoidant personality traits. RESULTS: Overall, outcomes from multiple taxometric analyses supported dimensional structure. This is consistent with conceptualizations of social phobia as lying on a continuum with avoidant personality traits.

In addition, higher rates of depression are experienced by mothers of children with ADHD compared to mothers of children without ADHD. This study aimed to determine whether particular sleep problems in children with ADHD are associated with specific maternal mental health difficulties. Participants: Female caregivers of 379 children with ADHD (5-13 years) participated. The child's ADHD diagnosis was reconfirmed during recruitment by caregivers completing the ADHD Rating Scale-IV. Method: Caregivers reported on their mental health using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and their child's sleep using the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire. Unadjusted and adjusted regression analyzes were undertaken. Results: In the adjusted analyzes, there were small significant associations between most aspects of child sleep (i.e. Bedtime Resistance, Night Waking, Parasomnias, Sleep Duration, Daytime Sleepiness and Total Sleep Problems) and maternal Anxiety and Stress, with the exception of Sleep-Onset Delay. Bedtime Resistance, Sleep Duration, Daytime Sleepiness and Total Sleep Problems also had small significant associations with maternal Depression. Sleep Anxiety had a small significant association with maternal Anxiety only. Conclusions: This study demonstrates important connections between many child sleep problems and particular aspects of maternal mental health, suggesting adaptations to behavioral sleep interventions for children and mental health interventions for parents to take a family approach may be beneficial. Future research should consider the longitudinal associations between child sleep and parent mental health in an effort to inform future intervention approaches.","['Martin, Christina A', 'Papadopoulos, Nicole', 'Rinehart, Nicole', 'Sciberras, Emma']","['Martin CA', 'Papadopoulos N', 'Rinehart N', 'Sciberras E']","['School of Psychology, Deakin University , Geelong, VIC, Australia.', 'Deakin Child Study Centre, School of Psychology, Deakin University , Geelong, VIC, Australia.', 'Deakin Child Study Centre, School of Psychology, Deakin University , Geelong, VIC, Australia.', 'School of Psychology, Deakin University , Geelong, VIC, Australia.', ""Health Services, Murdoch Children's Research Institute , Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Melbourne , Parkville, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191125,England,Behav Sleep Med,Behavioral sleep medicine,101149327,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Middle Aged', 'Mothers', 'Sleep Wake Disorders/*psychology']",,,,,2019/11/26 06:00,2021/07/16 06:00,['2019/11/26 06:00'],"['2019/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15402002.2019.1696346 [doi]'],ppublish,Behav Sleep Med. 2021 Jan-Feb;19(1):12-25. doi: 10.1080/15402002.2019.1696346.

This large part of the overall burden underlines a growing need for innovation to support the treatment of mental disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This empirical study features two groups of patients; a group of nine patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder and a group of twelve patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. The patients in the study carry a smartwatch for six weeks, continuously collecting data into a digital health platform. Additionally, they answer five daily wellbeing questions in a mobile app. To supplement that data, they also answer a questionnaire three times over the interval and at the end of the period they attend a semi-structured interview. We offer four main aspects to consider for PGHD in mental health: i) sharing data easily with healthcare professionals, ii) being able to engage with your own PGHD, iii) the watch use can help the patients regulate routine in their daily life, iv) tonality and phrasing.","['Sigurethardottir, Steinunn Groa', 'Islind, Anna Sigridur', 'Oskarsdottir, Maria']","['Sigurethardottir SG', 'Islind AS', 'Oskarsdottir M']","['Reykjavik University, Department of Computer Science, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Reykjavik University, Department of Computer Science, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Reykjavik University, Department of Computer Science, Reykjavik, Iceland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Stud Health Technol Inform,Studies in health technology and informatics,9214582,,"['*Bipolar Disorder/therapy', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Mobile Applications', '*Schizophrenia/diagnosis/therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bipolar Disorder', 'Digital Platform', 'Mental Health', 'Mobile Application', 'Schizophrenia', 'Smartwatch', 'eHealth', 'mHealth']",2022/05/26 06:00,2022/05/27 06:00,['2022/05/25 08:33'],"['2022/05/25 08:33 [entrez]', '2022/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['SHTI220445 [pii]', '10.3233/SHTI220445 [doi]']",ppublish,Stud Health Technol Inform. 2022 May 25;294:239-243. doi: 10.3233/SHTI220445.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This situation could be explained among other reasons due to the difficulties to define and operationalise what good mental health is. The current manuscript, produced by the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Thematic Working Group on the Prevention of Mental Disorders and Mental Health Promotion (ECNP TWG PMD-MHP), presents a critical review of the available operationalizations for good mental health. A pragmatic conceptual operationalisation of good mental health is a much-needed step towards more standardised research in this field. Good mental health can be defined as a state of well-being that allows individuals to cope with the normal stresses of life and function productively. Universal and selective interventions are suitable to promote mental health. Core domains that define good mental health encompass: (i) mental health literacy, (ii) attitude towards mental disorders, (iii) self-perceptions and values, (iv) cognitive skills, (v) academic/ occupational performance, (vi) emotions, (vii) behaviours, (viii) self-management strategies, (ix) social skills, (x) family and significant relationships (xi) physical health, (xii) sexual health, (xiii) meaning of life, (xiv) and quality of life. These domains should be widely traceable in the literature and can be used to conduct further empirical research in the field of good mental health. Such data can lead to more robust evidence to identify and establish the pathways to follow in order to improve mental health.","['Fusar-Poli, Paolo', 'Salazar de Pablo, Gonzalo', 'De Micheli, Andrea', 'Nieman, Dorien H', 'Correll, Christoph U', 'Kessing, Lars Vedel', 'Pfennig, Andrea', 'Bechdolf, Andreas', 'Borgwardt, Stefan', 'Arango, Celso', 'van Amelsvoort, Therese']","['Fusar-Poli P', 'Salazar de Pablo G', 'De Micheli A', 'Nieman DH', 'Correll CU', 'Kessing LV', 'Pfennig A', 'Bechdolf A', 'Borgwardt S', 'Arango C', 'van Amelsvoort T']","[""Early Psychosis: Interventions and Clinical-detection (EPIC) lab, Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK; OASIS service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK; Department of Brain and Behavioural Sciences, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy; National Institute for Health Research, Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.

In addition, rightly or wrongly sexuality often defines people and also affects social attitudes. These attitudes, if negative, can contribute to stigma and prevent people from help seeking if they are suffering from mental health problems. Recent changes in policy towards same-sex relationships have been positive in many countries including the UK and the USA, whereas in others such as Russia and Uganda attitudes have become more negative and punitive. Sexual activity is seen as having both pleasurable and procreational functions which contribute to society's attitudes to homosexual behaviour. Inevitably, individual responses to their own sexuality and sexual behaviour will be influenced by social attitudes. To ensure that those with various sexual variations can access psychiatric services without discrimination, various levels of interventions are needed. Here we discuss different levels of intervention and organizational change that may make it possible. Social organization and institutional organization of services need to be sensitive, especially as rates of many mental disorders are high in individuals who may be sexually variant. Those providing services need to understand their own negative attitudes as well as prejudices to ensure that services are emotionally accessible.","['Kalra, Gurvinder', 'Ventriglio, Antonio', 'Bhugra, Dinesh']","['Kalra G', 'Ventriglio A', 'Bhugra D']","['a Flynn Inpatient Psychiatric Unit, La Trobe Regional Hospital (LRH), LRH Mental Health Services , Traralgon, Victoria , Australia ;', 'b Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Foggia , Foggia , Italy ;', ""c Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry , King's College London , De Crespigny Park, London , UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20151109,England,Int Rev Psychiatry,"International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)",8918131,IM,"['Health Services/*standards', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*standards', '*Prejudice', '*Sexuality']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Homosexuality', 'mental health services', 'organisations', 'sexual variation']",2015/11/11 06:00,2016/09/07 06:00,['2015/11/11 06:00'],"['2015/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09540261.2015.1094032 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Rev Psychiatry. 2015;27(5):463-9. doi: 10.3109/09540261.2015.1094032.

The goals of this study were to describe the prevalence and types of low back pain (acute vs. recurrent) among service members injured while on combat deployments, and to examine the differences in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression prevalence and severity, as well as quality of life, for individuals with low back pain compared with those without. METHOD: Baseline assessment data from a subset of participants (n = 4,397) in the Wounded Warrior Recovery Project, a large, longitudinal examination of patient-reported outcomes, were used in conjunction with Department of Defense medical records data. RESULTS: Almost half of participants had acute or recurrent low back pain diagnoses, and the majority of individuals had no diagnosis of low back pain prior to their deployment-related injury. Individuals with low back pain, particularly recurrent, screened positive for PTSD and depression at higher rates, reported more severe symptoms of these disorders, and demonstrated poorer quality of life than those without. CONCLUSIONS: Low back pain was a prevalent issue among service members with deployment-related injury and was associated with worsened mental health outcomes and quality of life. Health care providers and researchers in multiple disciplines should consider the complex relationships between pain and mental health in order to further optimize treatment and outcomes.

We argue that a human science is best achieved with the use of indexes, not diagnoses, to measure mental health. We present a brief history of diagnostic instruments and detail how a diagnosis is made. We show how use of diagnoses to measure mental health discounts much human suffering. They dichotomize the true range of feelings and emotions into crude either/or distinctions that do not reflect the reality of people's lives, and they often exclude suffering such as that due to loss or illness that does not meet medical model preconceptions about mental disorder. Using diagnoses to measure mental health presents a reified image of hidden disease knowable and manageable only by trained professionals--beyond the capacity of the suffering individuals to understand and control.","['Mirowsky, John', 'Ross, Catherine E']","['Mirowsky J', 'Ross CE']","['Department of Sociology, Ohio State University, 300 Bricker Hall, 190 North Oval Mall, Columbus, Ohio 43210-1353, USA. mirowsky.1@osu.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Health Soc Behav,Journal of health and social behavior,0103130,IM,"['Attitude to Health', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humanism', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*diagnosis', '*Mental Health', '*Sociology']",,,,,2002/07/05 10:00,2002/07/18 10:01,['2002/07/05 10:00'],"['2002/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Health Soc Behav. 2002 Jun;43(2):152-70.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High dynamics of the expenditure increase will result in the development of a model of community psychiatry and a gradual move away from the hospital psychiatric treatment towards mental health care in the open system, including the community one. METHODS: This research is based on data on the implementation of services for mental health care in the framework of agreements with the National Health Fund, which has been collected in the NFZ IT system. Some information is from 2010, which was adopted as the base date for the implementation of the principles of the National Mental Health Program in 2011. The data from the implementation of individual benefits in 2013 were used for the comparison. In addition, other selected organizational, economic and financial elements of the psychiatric care system were analyzed. RESULTS: In 2013, compared to 2010, increased the number of mental health care organizations: outpatient mental health clinics (an increase of 37 clinics), outpatient mental health day hospital wards (an increase of 25 wards) and community psychiatric treatment teams (an increase of 74 teams). The largest increase in the value of contracts (approx. 150%) was related to community treatment teams. CONCLUSIONS: Between 2010 and 2013 there was an increase in the value of cleared contracts in psychiatric care, in general and in each of the three forms of psychiatric care (i.e., in day wards, outpatient mental health clinics and in community teams). The highest increase in investments included community treatment teams, to a lesser extent day wards and outpatient clinics. The adopted organizational, economic and financial solutions in the mental health care system are in line with the objectives of the National Mental Health Program, including the assumed structure of Mental Health Centers.","['Lisiecka-Bielanowicz, Mira', 'Biechowska, Daria', 'Cianciara, Dorota']","['Lisiecka-Bielanowicz M', 'Biechowska D', 'Cianciara D']","['Zaklad Profilaktyki Zagrozen Srodowiskowych i Alergologii, Wydzial Nauki o Zdrowiu, Warszawski Uniwersytet Medyczny.', 'Zaklad Zdrowia Publicznego, Instytut Psychiatrii i Neurologii.', 'Zaklad Epidemiologii i Promocji Zdrowia, Szkola Zdrowia Publicznego, Centrum Medyczne Ksztalcenia Podyplomowego.']","['eng', 'pol']",,['Journal Article'],20180228,Poland,Psychiatr Pol,Psychiatria polska,0103314,IM,"['Community Mental Health Services/*economics/organization & administration', 'Health Services Accessibility/economics', 'Health Services Needs and Demand/*economics', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Psychiatric/*economics', 'Mental Disorders/*economics/therapy', 'Mental Health/*economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Poland', 'Psychiatric Department, Hospital/economics']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['community psychiatry', 'mental health services']",2018/04/29 06:00,2018/09/20 06:00,['2018/04/29 06:00'],"['2018/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['68147 [pii]', '10.12740/PP/68147 [doi]']",ppublish,Psychiatr Pol. 2018 Feb 28;52(1):143-156. doi: 10.12740/PP/68147.

The use of internet technologies has the potential to increase access to evidence-based mental health services for a larger proportion of the population with the use of fewer resources. However, despite extensive evidence that internet interventions can be effective in the treatment of mental health disorders, user adherence to such internet intervention is suboptimal. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to (1) inspect and identify the adaptive elements of IDPT for mental health disorders, (2) examine how system adaptation influences the efficacy of IDPT on mental health treatments, (3) identify the information architecture, adaptive dimensions, and strategies for implementing these interventions for mental illness, and (4) use the findings to create a conceptual framework that provides better user adherence and adaptiveness in IDPT for mental health issues. METHODS: The review followed the guidelines from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The research databases Medline (PubMed), ACM Digital Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane were searched for studies dating from January 2000 to January 2020. Based on predetermined selection criteria, data from eligible studies were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 3341 studies were initially identified based on the inclusion criteria. Following a review of the title, abstract, and full text, 31 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected, most of which described attempts to tailor interventions for mental health disorders. The most common adaptive elements were feedback messages to patients from therapists and intervention content. However, how these elements contribute to the efficacy of IDPT in mental health were not reported. The most common information architecture used by studies was tunnel-based, although a number of studies did not report the choice of information architecture used. Rule-based strategies were the most common adaptive strategies used by these studies. All of the studies were broadly grouped into two adaptive dimensions based on user preferences or using performance measures, such as psychometric tests. CONCLUSIONS: Several studies suggest that adaptive IDPT has the potential to enhance intervention outcomes and increase user adherence. There is a lack of studies reporting design elements, adaptive elements, and adaptive strategies in IDPT systems. Hence, focused research on adaptive IDPT systems and clinical trials to assess their effectiveness are needed.","['Mukhiya, Suresh Kumar', 'Wake, Jo Dugstad', 'Inal, Yavuz', 'Pun, Ka I', 'Lamo, Yngve']","['Mukhiya SK', 'Wake JD', 'Inal Y', 'Pun KI', 'Lamo Y']","['Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Bergen, Norway.', 'NORCE Norwegian Research Centre, Bergen, Norway.', 'University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Bergen, Norway.', 'Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20201127,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,IM,"['Humans', 'Internet/*standards', 'Mental Disorders/*therapy', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Psychotherapy/*methods']",PMC7732710,,['NOTNLM'],"['adaptive system', 'adaptive treatment', 'architecture centric development', 'cognitive behavioural therapy', 'flexible mHealth internet interventions', 'internet-based treatment', 'internet-delivered psychological treatment', 'literature review', 'mental health', 'tailored internet interventions']",2020/11/28 06:00,2021/03/02 06:00,['2020/11/27 12:07'],"['2020/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/27 12:07 [entrez]', '2020/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['v22i11e21066 [pii]', '10.2196/21066 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2020 Nov 27;22(11):e21066. doi: 10.2196/21066.,11,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1813-7633', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2515-7720', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9919-6637', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8763-5548', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9196-1779']",,['Conflicts of Interest: None declared.'],"['(c)Suresh Kumar Mukhiya, Jo Dugstad Wake, Yavuz Inal, Ka I Pun, Yngve Lamo.', 'Originally published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research', '(http://www.jmir.org), 27.11.2020.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, limited information is available on how judges make treatment decisions about evidence-based practices. In this qualitative study, we interviewed mental health court judges to evaluate: (1) perspectives toward the role of PTSD in criminal behavior; (2) knowledge about evidence-based practice for PTSD; (3) treatment decisions for defendants with PTSD; and (4) treatment decisions for defendants at risk for suicide, a common comorbidity with PTSD. We hypothesized that mental health court judges would report low familiarity with evidence-based practices for PTSD despite wide recognition of the impact of trauma on criminal behavior. Methods: Mental health court judges (N = 11, 60% women, 60% between 50-59 years) were recruited from 7 states in the US and completed a demographics questionnaire and semi-structured qualitative interview that was transcribed and double-coded. Results: Judges in mental health court unanimously agreed that PTSD is highly prevalent among their defendants, but that they had not having received formal education about evidence-based practices for PTSD. They reported relying on their team members to provide recommendations for treatment planning and viewed their role as the enforcer of the treatment teams' suggestions. Finally, judges also reported that suicide prevention is an important consideration and that there is a need for universal suicide risk assessments. Conclusions: These findings have implications for continuing education among judges in mental health court, and we recommend mandated training to increase awareness of evidence-based practices for PTSD and suicide prevention.","['Brown, Lily A', 'AlRabiah, Reem', 'Terasse, Melanie', 'Aksianiuk, Valeryia', 'Sisti, Dominic']","['Brown LA', 'AlRabiah R', 'Terasse M', 'Aksianiuk V', 'Sisti D']","['Department of Psychiatry, 6572University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, 6572University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Sociology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Scattergood Program for Applied Ethics in Behavioral Health Care, 6572University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Scattergood Program for Applied Ethics in Behavioral Health Care, 6572University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, 6572University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Scattergood Program for Applied Ethics in Behavioral Health Care, 6572University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20220427,England,Med Sci Law,"Medicine, science, and the law",0400721,IM,"['Humans', 'Female', 'Male', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/psychology', 'Mental Health', '*Mental Disorders/psychology', 'Comorbidity']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Posttraumatic stress disorder', 'continuing education', 'evidence-based practice', 'mental health court', 'suicide']",2022/04/28 06:00,2023/01/12 06:00,['2022/04/27 05:07'],"['2022/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2022/04/27 05:07 [entrez]']",['10.1177/00258024221096250 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Sci Law. 2023 Jan;63(1):42-52. doi: 10.1177/00258024221096250.

This seems to be particularly true among first responders. Unfortunately, the research regarding stigma in first responders is lacking. This may be due, in part, to the absence of appropriate measurement tools to allow such research. Police Officer Stigma Scale (POSS) has recently been developed to address this issue, but its psychometric properties have gone largely untested. Therefore, this study sought to identify the underlying factor structure and internal consistency of the POSS. This paper used a sample of 135 first responders. Using factor analysis with an orthogonal rotation on Stuart's 11-item POSS, the participant's results revealed two main components, accounting for a total of 72.79% of the overall variance. Factor one is ""maltreatment of colleagues with a mental disorder,"" and is associated with six of the 11 items on the scale, such as ""Most police officers believe that a colleague who has had a mental illness is not trustworthy."" Factor two is ""fear of disclosing a mental disorder."" It includes items such as ""Most police officers would not disclose to a supervisor/manager if they were experiencing a mental illness."" Findings from this research are similar to the results of previous studies with components such as unwillingness to disclose a mental health condition, fear of how the public will treat an individual with a mental disorder, and anger toward those who decide to seek treatment or get diagnosed with a mental illness. These findings imply that Stuart's POSS is reliable but needs to include two components rather than one. With the two main components, further research can now be conducted to understand why and ultimately mitigate maltreatment or stigma against first responders with a mental health condition.","['Burzee, Zachery', 'Bowers, Clint', 'Beidel, Deborah']","['Burzee Z', 'Bowers C', 'Beidel D']","['Department of Psychology, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States.', 'UCF RESTORES, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States.', 'UCF RESTORES, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20220920,Switzerland,Front Public Health,Frontiers in public health,101616579,IM,"['*Emergency Responders', 'Humans', '*Mental Disorders', 'Mental Health', 'Police', 'Social Stigma']",PMC9530805,,['NOTNLM'],"['firefighters', 'first responders', 'mental health stigma', 'police', 'public stigma', 'self-stigma', 'stigma']",2022/10/08 06:00,2022/10/12 06:00,['2022/10/07 02:38'],"['2022/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2022/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/10/07 02:38 [entrez]', '2022/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/10/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fpubh.2022.951347 [doi]'],epublish,Front Public Health. 2022 Sep 20;10:951347. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2022.951347. eCollection 2022.,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']","['Copyright (c) 2022 Burzee, Bowers and Beidel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the association between ozone (O3) and fine particles (PM2.5) and emergency department (ED) visits related to mental health outcomes, including psychosis, neurosis, neurotic/stress, substance use, mood/affective, depression, bipolar, schizotypal/delusional, schizophrenia, self-harm/suicide, and homicide/inflicted injury, from 2005 through 2013 in California. Air monitoring data were provided by the U.S. EPA's Air Quality System Data Mart and ED data were provided by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. We used the time-series method with a quasi-Poisson regression, controlling for apparent temperature, day of the week, holidays, and seasonal/long-term trends. Per 10 parts per billion increase, we observed significant cumulative 7-day associations between O3 and all mental health [0.64%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.21, 1.07], depression [1.87%, 95% CI: 0.62, 3.15], self-harm/suicide [1.43%, 95% CI: 0.35, 2.51], and bipolar [2.83%, 95% CI: 1.53, 4.15]. We observed 30-day lag associations between O3 and neurotic disorder [1.22%, 95% CI: 0.48, 1.97] and homicide/inflicted injury [2.01%, 95% CI: 1.00, 3.02]. Same-day mean PM2.5 was associated with a 0.42% [95% CI: 0.14, 0.70] increase in all mental health, 1.15% [95% CI: 0.62, 1.69] increase in homicide/inflicted injury, and a 0.57% [95% CI: 0.22, 0.92] increase in neurotic disorders per 10 mug/m3 increase. Other outcomes not listed here were not statistically significant for O3 or PM2.5. Risk varied by age group and was generally greater for females, Asians, and Hispanics. We also observed seasonal variation for outcomes including but not limited to depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, self-harm/suicide, and homicide/inflicted injury. Ambient O3 or PM2.5 may increase the risk of mental health illness, though underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood.

METHODS: We compared screening status and weighted prevalence of selected mental disorders from the two-stage school-based South Carolina Project to Learn About Youth-Mental Health (Time 1) and its replication study (Time 2) conducted between 2014 and 2017. During stage 1, two teacher screeners were used to group students into high or low risk for a mental disorder. During stage 2, parents of selected students completed a structured diagnostic interview to assess whether their child met criteria for specific disorders. RESULTS: For stage 1, 19.9% of students screened as high risk for a mental disorder at Time 2 compared to 17.8% at Time 1. Among students included at both timepoints, 9.1% screened as high risk at both timepoints while screening status changed for 20.7%. The overall prevalence of included mental disorders was approximately 18% at both time points There were no differences (P-values >.05) in prevalence of individual mental disorders between Time 1 (range:0.3%-6.7%) and Time 2 (range:1.2%-7.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Study findings demonstrate that similar methodology yielded similar prevalence estimates of mental disorders and can inform community-level planning for improving mental health in children.","['Wanga, Valentine', 'Danielson, Melissa L', 'Bitsko, Rebecca H', 'Holbrook, Joseph R', 'Lipton, Corey', 'Claussen, Angelika H', 'Siceloff, E Rebekah', 'Flory, Kate']","['Wanga V', 'Danielson ML', 'Bitsko RH', 'Holbrook JR', 'Lipton C', 'Claussen AH', 'Siceloff ER', 'Flory K']","['Division of Human Development and Disability, National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA; Epidemic Intelligence Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA.

Multilevel analysis.,158-63,,BACKGROUND: The relationship between the Mental Illness Needs Index (MINI) and the common mental disorders is not known. AIMS: To investigate associations between the small-area MINI score and common mental disorder at individual level. METHOD: Mental health status was measured using the Mental Health Inventory of the Short Form 36 instrument (SF-36). Data from the Caerphilly Health and Social Needs population survey were analysed in multilevel models of 10 653 individuals aged 18-74 years nested within the 2001 UK census geographies of 110 lower super output areas and 33 wards. RESULTS: The MINI score was significantly associated with common mental disorder after adjusting for individual risk factors. This association was stronger at the smaller spatial scale of the lower super output area and for individuals who were permanently sick or disabled. CONCLUSIONS: The MINI is potentially useful for small-area needs assessment and service planning for common mental disorder in community settings.,"['Fone, David L', 'Dunstan, Frank', 'John, Ann', 'Lloyd, Keith']","['Fone DL', 'Dunstan F', 'John A', 'Lloyd K']","['Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Psychiatry,The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,0342367,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Health Services Needs and Demand/organization & administration', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*therapy', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Risk Factors', 'Small-Area Analysis', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Unemployment/*psychology', 'Wales']",,,,,2007/08/02 09:00,2008/01/08 09:00,['2007/08/02 09:00'],"['2007/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S000712500017312X [pii]', '10.1192/bjp.bp.106.027458 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Psychiatry. 2007 Aug;191:158-63. doi: 10.1192/bjp.bp.106.027458.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recognition and exploration of this lineage can inform how we communicate about mental health going forward, as reflected by the 9 papers which make up this special issue. Our introduction provides some framework for the history of communicating mental health over the past 300 years. We will show that there have been diverse ways and means of describing, disseminating and discussing mental health, in relation both to therapeutic practices and between practitioners, patients and the public. Communicating about mental health, we argue, has been informed by the desire for positive change, as much as by developments in reporting, legislation and technology. However, while the modes of communication have developed, the issues involved remain essentially the same. Most practitioners have sought to understand and to innovate, though not always with positive results. Some lost sight of patients as people; patients have felt and have been ignored or silenced by doctors and carers. Money has always talked, for without adequate investment services and care have suffered, contributing to the stigma surrounding mental illness. While it is certainly 'time to talk' to improve experiences, it is also time to change the language that underpins cultural attitudes towards mental illness, time to listen to people with mental health issues and, crucially, time to hear.","['Wynter, Rebecca', 'Smith, Leonard']","['Wynter R', 'Smith L']","['History of Medicine Unit, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'History of Medicine Unit, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Introductory Journal Article']",,United States,Med Humanit,Medical humanities,100959585,IM,"['History, 18th Century', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', '*Mental Disorders', 'Mental Health/*history', 'Mental Health Services/history', '*Social Stigma']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['History', 'Mental health care']",2017/06/01 06:00,2018/04/06 06:00,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['2016/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['medhum-2016-011082 [pii]', '10.1136/medhum-2016-011082 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Humanit. 2017 Jun;43(2):73-80. doi: 10.1136/medhum-2016-011082.,2,,,['Competing interests: None declared.'],"['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

In romantic relationships, impaired mental health does not only affect the individual but also their partner and therefore needs to be coped with dyadically. In this systematic review, we summarize research examining dyadic coping (DC) in the context of mental health and individual and relational outcomes. We searched for peer-reviewed articles published between January 1990 and April 2023 on PsycInfo, Medline, and PSYNDEX on DC and mental health within romantic relationships. A total of 60 qualitative, quantitative, and intervention studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting on 16,394 individuals and 4,945 dyads. To synthesize the studies, we used a narrative synthesis approach. Overall, stress expression and positive DC yielded beneficial individual and relational outcomes, whereas, for negative DC, the opposite was true. Results differed between mental health clusters and context played an important role (e.g., symptom severity, life phase). Due to the great diversity of studies and variables, further research should focus on understudied mental health clusters (e.g., anxiety disorders). Clinicians are advised to view mental health issues as a dyadic rather than an individual phenomenon (""we-disease"") and develop tailored couple-centered interventions.","['Landolt, Selina A', 'Weitkamp, Katharina', 'Roth, Michelle', 'Sisson, Natalie M', 'Bodenmann, Guy']","['Landolt SA', 'Weitkamp K', 'Roth M', 'Sisson NM', 'Bodenmann G']","['Department of Psychology, University of Zurich, Switzerland.

In the course of many of these emergencies, firefighters witness events which have the potential to induce emotional trauma, such as badly injured people, deceased children, and individuals who are highly distraught. Previous research suggests that repeated exposure to these traumas (RET) may have negative impacts on the emotional and mental health of fire service personnel. Research on the mental health of firefighters has been limited to small surveys reporting the prevalence of specific mental health problems such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder among firefighters. OBJECTIVE: Despite the likelihood that RET leads to negative outcomes in firefighters, data is lacking on how exposure impacts fire service personnel. The current study examines the experiences of firefighters related to RET. METHODS: Using formative research methods, we examined the beliefs and experiences of firefighters and administrators from across the United States regarding the impact of RET on firefighter health. RESULTS: Study findings highlight the cumulative psychological toll of repeated exposure to traumatic events including desensitization, flashbacks, and irritability. CONCLUSION: Results of the current study suggest that RET is a significant concern for emergency responders that warrants additional research and attention. It is likely that the long term consequences of RET are closely intertwined with other mental health outcomes and general well-being of this important occupational group.","['Jahnke, Sara A', 'Poston, Walker S Carlos', 'Haddock, Christopher K', 'Murphy, Beth']","['Jahnke SA', 'Poston WS', 'Haddock CK', 'Murphy B']","['Center for Fire, Rescue & EMS Health Research, Institute for Biobehavioral Health Research, National Development & Research Institutes, Leawood, KS, USA.', 'Center for Fire, Rescue & EMS Health Research, Institute for Biobehavioral Health Research, National Development & Research Institutes, Leawood, KS, USA.', 'Center for Fire, Rescue & EMS Health Research, Institute for Biobehavioral Health Research, National Development & Research Institutes, Leawood, KS, USA.', 'Integrative Mental Health and Wellness, Bellevue, WA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Work,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",9204382,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Depression/etiology/psychology', 'Female', 'Firefighters/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/etiology/psychology', 'United States', 'Wounds and Injuries/*psychology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['EMS', 'Firefighters', 'depression', 'mental health', 'post-traumatic stress', 'trauma']",2016/02/19 06:00,2017/05/23 06:00,['2016/02/19 06:00'],"['2016/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['WOR2255 [pii]', '10.3233/WOR-162255 [doi]']",ppublish,Work. 2016 Feb 15;53(4):737-44. doi: 10.3233/WOR-162255.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2007 and 2009, we administered online surveys with brief mental health screens to random samples of students at 26 campuses nationwide. We used sample probability weights to adjust for survey nonresponse. A total of 14,175 students completed the survey, corresponding to a 44% participation rate. The prevalence of positive screens was 17.3% for depression, 4.1% for panic disorder, 7.0% for generalized anxiety, 6.3% for suicidal ideation, and 15.3% for nonsuicidal self-injury. Mental health problems were significantly associated with sex, race/ethnicity, religiosity, relationship status, living on campus, and financial situation. The prevalence of conditions varied substantially across the campuses, although campus-level variation was still a small proportion of overall variation in student mental health. The findings offer a starting point for identifying individual and contextual factors that may be useful to target in intervention strategies.","['Eisenberg, Daniel', 'Hunt, Justin', 'Speer, Nicole']","['Eisenberg D', 'Hunt J', 'Speer N']","['Department of Health Management and Policy, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, USA. daneis@umich.edu']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Nerv Ment Dis,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,0375402,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Students/*psychology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Universities/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2013/01/01 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2013/01/01 06:00'],"['2013/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['00005053-201301000-00012 [pii]', '10.1097/NMD.0b013e31827ab077 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nerv Ment Dis. 2013 Jan;201(1):60-7. doi: 10.1097/NMD.0b013e31827ab077.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to examine whether maternal prenatal mental health disorders are associated with stillbirth and/or infant mortality. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Scopus were searched for studies examining the association of any maternal prenatal (occurring before or during pregnancy) mental health disorder(s) and stillbirth or infant mortality. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the I(2) statistic. Subgroup analyses were performed to identify the source of heterogeneity. Of 4487 records identified, 28 met our inclusion criteria with 27 contributing to the meta-analyses. Over 60% of studies examined stillbirth and 54% of them evaluated neonatal or infant mortality. Thirteen studies investigated the association between maternal depression and anxiety and stillbirth/infant mortality, pooled OR, 1.42 (95% CI, 1.16-1.73; I(2), 76.7%). Another 13 studies evaluated the association between severe maternal mental illness and stillbirth/infant mortality, pooled OR, 1.47 (95% CI, 1.28-1.68; I(2), 62.3%). We found similar results for the association of any maternal mental health disorders and stillbirth/infant mortality (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.43-1.77) and in subgroup analyses according to types of fetal/infant mortality. We found no significant evidence of publication bias. Maternal prenatal mental health disorders appear to be associated with a moderate increase in the risk of stillbirth and infant mortality, although the mechanisms are unclear. Efforts to prevent and treat these disorders may reduce the scale of stillbirth/infant deaths.","['Adane, Akilew A', 'Bailey, Helen D', 'Morgan, Vera A', 'Galbally, Megan', 'Farrant, Brad M', 'Marriott, Rhonda', 'White, Scott W', 'Shepherd, Carrington Cj']","['Adane AA', 'Bailey HD', 'Morgan VA', 'Galbally M', 'Farrant BM', 'Marriott R', 'White SW', 'Shepherd CC']","['Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, P.O.

Findings show that public interest was highest for major depressive disorder, followed by anxiety disorder, substance abuse, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Among them, public interest in schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and substance abuse improved following the Act's legislation.

This systematic review sought to summarise current knowledge regarding the mental health of adolescents and pre-adolescents diagnosed with inherited arrhythmia syndromes. Searches combining psychological problems with inherited cardiac arrhythmia diagnoses identified 16 studies with paediatric (<18 years) inherited arrhythmia patients. All studies were cross-sectional; 8/16 required an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Methods were quantitative (n=11), qualitative (n=4), or mixed (n=1), with 14-100% of participants having an inherited arrhythmia syndrome. Mean/median age in 13/16 studies was 12-16 years. Patients and parents reported lower quality of life, particularly in relation to physical function, social relationships, restriction of peer activities, bodily pain, and mental and emotional health. Self-perceptions and behaviour were similar to healthy populations. Rates of anxiety and depression (15-33% of these patients) were not increased in these studies where patients were assessed 2+ years after diagnosis. Higher mental health risk occurred among patients who have a diagnosed sibling, those with cardiomyopathy, and those who report decreased quality of life. Mental health research among youth with inherited arrhythmias is extremely limited and of low quality. Data, primarily from patients 2-4 years after diagnosis or treatment with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, indicate that quality of life may be decreased and 15-33% experience mental health issues. Future research is required to examine the mental health and quality of life of paediatric patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes, whether or not they have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, from time of diagnosis.","['Longmuir, Patricia E', 'Sampson, Margaret', 'Ham, Jennifer', 'Weekes, Makenzie', 'Patel, Bhavika J', 'Gow, Robert M']","['Longmuir PE', 'Sampson M', 'Ham J', 'Weekes M', 'Patel BJ', 'Gow RM']","[""1Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute,Ottawa,Ontario,Canada."", ""1Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute,Ottawa,Ontario,Canada."", ""1Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute,Ottawa,Ontario,Canada."", ""1Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute,Ottawa,Ontario,Canada."", ""1Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute,Ottawa,Ontario,Canada."", '2Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine,University of Ottawa,Ottawa,Ontario,Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20180118,England,Cardiol Young,Cardiology in the young,9200019,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', '*Arrhythmias, Cardiac/congenital/epidemiology/psychology', 'Child', 'Global Health', 'Humans', '*Mental Health', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', '*Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Syndrome']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['anxiety', 'arrhythmia', 'child', 'depression', 'mental health']",2018/01/19 06:00,2018/09/11 06:00,['2018/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['S104795111700289X [pii]', '10.1017/S104795111700289X [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiol Young. 2018 May;28(5):621-631. doi: 10.1017/S104795111700289X.

Additionally, parent-child interaction is important for the child's socio-emotional development. To date, the relationship between attachment and temperament and character for child mental health development and its effects on parents remains mostly unclear. The aim of the present study was thus to examine the relationship of attachment, temperament and character, parental stress, and mental health problems among 125 children (mean age = 7.14 years) in Switzerland. Temperament and character, attachment disorder (symptoms), parental stress, and mental health problems were assessed with psychometric questionnaires; attachment was assessed with an additional observational measure. Descriptive characters of the sample were presented, and group differences and correlations were computed. For temperament traits, results revealed significant group differences for novelty seeking and persistence and attachment disorder types. For character traits, the findings showed significant group differences for self-directedness and cooperativeness and attachment disorder types. Moderate effect sizes for groups differences were found. Further, the mixed-type (inhibited and disinhibited) and inhibited attachment disorder type were the most burdened groups. The present findings suggest that temperament and character traits, as well as parental stress and mental health problems are associated with the occurrence of attachment disorders among children. Future longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed to examine the causal relationships of temperament and character with attachment, including person-related and environmental factors among children.","['Schroder, Martin', 'Seker, Suheyla', ""d'Huart, Delfine"", 'Izat, Yonca', 'Bolten, Margarete', 'Schmeck, Klaus', 'Schmid, Marc']","['Schroder M', 'Seker S', ""d'Huart D"", 'Izat Y', 'Bolten M', 'Schmeck K', 'Schmid M']","['Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Research, University Psychiatric Clinics Basel, University of Basel, 4002 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Research, University Psychiatric Clinics Basel, University of Basel, 4002 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Research, University Psychiatric Clinics Basel, University of Basel, 4002 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Vivantes Clinic Friedrichshain, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Berlin, 10249 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Research, University Psychiatric Clinics Basel, University of Basel, 4002 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Research, University Psychiatric Clinics Basel, University of Basel, 4002 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Research, University Psychiatric Clinics Basel, University of Basel, 4002 Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20221122,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,IM,"['Humans', 'Child', '*Mental Health', '*Character', 'Temperament', 'Personality Inventory', 'Psychometrics']",PMC9737910,,['NOTNLM'],"['attachment', 'character', 'developmental psychology', 'foster care', 'mental health problems', 'parental stress', 'personality', 'temperament']",2022/12/12 06:00,2022/12/15 06:00,['2022/12/11 01:06'],"['2022/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2022/11/14 00:00 [revised]', '2022/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/12/11 01:06 [entrez]', '2022/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph192315458 [pii]', 'ijerph-19-15458 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph192315458 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2022 Nov 22;19(23):15458. doi: 10.3390/ijerph192315458.,23,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7343-880X'],,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deconstructing and reconstructing behaviour relevant to mental health disorders: The benefits of a psychological approach, with a focus on addiction. NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV XX(X)XXX-XXX, 2021. - Current treatments for mental health disorders are successful only for some patients, and there is an unmet clinical need for new treatment development. One challenge for treatment development has been how best to model complex human conditions in animals, where mechanisms can be more readily studied with a range of neuroscientific techniques. We suggest that an approach to modelling based on associative animal learning theory provides a suitable framework for deconstructing complex mental health disorders such that they can be studied in animals. These individual simple models can subsequently be used in combination to 'reconstruct' a more complex model of the mental health disorder of interest. Using examples primarily from the field of drug addiction, we explore the 'psychological approach' and suggest that in addition to facilitating translation and backtranslation of tasks between animal models and patients, this approach is also highly concordant with the concept of triangulation.","['Rutherford, Lydia G', 'Milton, Amy L']","['Rutherford LG', 'Milton AL']","['Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.

It is challenging to provide an in-depth understanding of recovery in a nursing curriculum because there are so many competing content areas and, as a result, time is constrained. However, because it is so vital to understand, educators would benefit from developing and sharing teaching strategies that explore recovery deeply, memorably, and engagingly, in order to encourage theory to be put into practice. Recent research into narrative pedagogy suggests that better use of stories, especially those that have strong emotional pull, such as well-made films and memoirs, may offer solutions to creative educators. Stories can have transformative potential, because once heard and heeded, the person can never go back to exactly how they were before. Recovery learned in this way becomes a threshold concept for the mental health curriculum. This paper outlines an engaging and time-efficient teaching strategy to develop these skills, drawing on the concept of narrative pedagogy.","['McAllister, Margaret']",['McAllister M'],"['School of Nursing and Midwifery, CQ University, Noosaville, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150514,Australia,Int J Ment Health Nurs,International journal of mental health nursing,101140527,,"['Education, Nursing/*methods', 'Empathy', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/diagnosis/nursing', 'Mental Health/*education', '*Motion Pictures', 'Teaching']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['film', 'mental health nursing education', 'narrative', 'stories', 'transformative learning']",2015/05/16 06:00,2017/01/18 06:00,['2015/05/16 06:00'],"['2015/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/inm.12134 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Ment Health Nurs. 2015 Aug;24(4):304-13. doi: 10.1111/inm.12134.

Effective coping behavior has been shown to be a psychosocial stress modifier in both occupational and nonoccupational settings. METHODS: Data were collected by using a web-based survey that administered the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist-Civilian, General Coping Questionnaire-30, and a supplementary questionnaire assessing various risk factors. Logistic regression models were used to test for the association of the 3 coping styles with probable PTSD following disaster exposure among federal disaster responders. RESULTS: In this sample of 549 study subjects, avoidant coping behavior was most associated with probable PTSD. In tested regression models, the odds ratios ranged from 1.19 to 1.26 and 95% confidence intervals ranged from 1.08 to 1.35. With control for various predictors, emotion-based coping behavior was also found to be associated with probable PTSD (odds ratio=1.11; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.22). CONCLUSION: This study found that in disaster responders exposed to traumatic disaster events, the likelihood of probable PTSD can be influenced by individual coping behavior style and other covariates. The continued probability of disasters underscores the critical importance of these findings both in terms of guiding mental health practitioners in treating exposed disaster responders and in stimulating future research.","['Loo, George T', 'DiMaggio, Charles J', 'Gershon, Robyn R', 'Canton, David B', 'Morse, Stephen S', 'Galea, Sandro']","['Loo GT', 'DiMaggio CJ', 'Gershon RR', 'Canton DB', 'Morse SS', 'Galea S']","['1Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,New York,New York.', '2New York University School of Medicine,New York,New York.', '3University of California at San Francisco,Institute for Health Policy Studies,San Francisco,California.', '4Shasta Community Health Center,Redding,California.', '5Columbia University,Mailman School of Public Health,New York,New York.', '6Boston University School of Public Health,Boston,Massachusetts.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20151223,United States,Disaster Med Public Health Prep,Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,101297401,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Disaster Medicine/statistics & numerical data', 'Emergency Responders/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['coping behavior', 'disaster medicine', 'emergency responders', 'mental health', 'post-traumatic', 'stress disorders']",2015/12/24 06:00,2016/10/25 06:00,['2015/12/24 06:00'],"['2015/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S193578931500141X [pii]', '10.1017/dmp.2015.141 [doi]']",ppublish,Disaster Med Public Health Prep. 2016 Feb;10(1):108-17. doi: 10.1017/dmp.2015.141.

The first was the birth of modern psychiatry in 18th century France. The second was the development of the field of inquiry in antiquity about the psuche and its mental activities, and the third was the turn of early Christian thought about mind and soul. A comparison between early modern and ancient concepts of ""the passions"" reveals the moral and ethical aspects of the concept ""mental health,"" and shows that more than for any other kind of illness, the history of mental illness and mental health is embedded within a moralistic philosophical perspective. Pathology as a field of study of ""the passions,"" whatever their definition was, enabled thinkers to refer to mental illness and health in moral terms. Although ""passions"" meant different things to different authors in different times, it was used by all as means to link between inner mental activities and the way the body react to the outside world. We can see it as an obligatory element to conceptualize illness, disorder, and health in regards to mental activities. Pagan ancient authors as well as early Christian authors used it to construct new theories and praxes about mental health, while early modern psychiatrists used it to develop corporeal methods of cure. In all currents of thought the concept of ""passions"" and the definition of the ways in which they affected the mind were used to distinguish mental illness and mental health from any other type of illness and health.

The present study sought to examine attitudes of college students regarding mental illness as part of a campus-wide ""common readings"" program. The book selected was a non-fiction account of a young girl with mental illness and the program was developed to initiate dialogue about young people with mental problems. Faculty from multiple disciplines collaborated on the project. A sample of 309 students completed a web-based survey after reading a vignette about an adolescent girl with mental illness. The vignette description was based on a character in the book selected in the program. The instruments measured attribution of stigma, social distance, and familiarity with people who have mental illness. Results demonstrated that younger students and those who are less familiar with mental illness were more likely to stigmatize and maintain social distance from those who are mentally ill. Awareness of the study findings can assist health professionals and mental health workers to identify interventions that can decrease stigma.

The electronic archives of the Italian newspaper ""La Stampa"" have been searched for the term ""schizo"". Selected articles were grouped in articles related to mental health (rMH) or article not related to mental health (nrMH). 946 articles were identified. Schizophrenia-related terms were used in 356 (36.03%) article rMH, which mainly reinforce negative stereotypes regarding mental illness both in rMH and nrMH groups. Over time, only in the rMH group a significant reduction of articles reinforcing negative stereotypes was found. Several factors have been identified as predictors of article reinforcing negative stereotypes: unnecessarily dramatic or sensational headline or content; inaccurate or not in the correct context use of medical terminology; emphasis to the illness rather than to the person; mental disorders are the same; disclosure of particular individual has a mental illness. Although there has been a significant reduction in stigmatizing articles, in the rMH group one article out of three reinforces negative stereotypes.","['Pingani, Luca', 'Sampogna, Gaia', 'Borghi, Giulia', 'Nasi, Annamaria', 'Coriani, Sandra', 'Luciano, Mario', 'Galeazzi, Gian Maria', 'Evans-Lacko, Sara', 'Fiorillo, Andrea']","['Pingani L', 'Sampogna G', 'Borghi G', 'Nasi A', 'Coriani S', 'Luciano M', 'Galeazzi GM', 'Evans-Lacko S', 'Fiorillo A']","['Human Resources Department, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale - IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Via Amendola, 2, 42121 Reggio Emilia, Italy; Degree Course in Psychiatric Rehabilitation, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Amendola, 2, 42121 Reggio Emilia, Italy.

In this study, I contend that, within the context of stigmatization, linked fate may also be compellingly conceptualized as an expression of collective threat and vulnerability with potential relevance for the mental health of African Americans, in particular. Nevertheless, existing research on race and mental health has remained silent on this issue, as linked fate has received little scholarly attention from researchers interested in mental health. Building on prior research on ethnoracial identity, stigmatization, and mental health among African Americans, I introduce linked fate as a neglected, yet important phenomenon among stigmatized minorities, which is deeply associated with ethnoracial identification and should also be considered when examining the consequences of ethnoracial identification on the mental health of African Americans. Using nationally-representative data and logistic regression, I find that linked fate not only fails to be health-protective but is significantly associated with poorer mental health among African Americans in the form of increased suffering from major depression, bipolar I, and anxiety disorders.","['Monk, Ellis P Jr']",['Monk EP Jr'],"['Harvard University, Department of Sociology, William James Hall, Cambridge, MA, 02138, USA.

The objective of this study was to investigate the link between chronic conditions and psychiatric disorders. The authors hypothesize that patients with chronic conditions have a higher comorbidity of certain psychiatric disorders compared to healthy individuals. Patients from Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine (Rowan SOM) Family Medicine offices completed an anonymous survey about medical and psychiatric diagnoses (Appendix 1). Multivariate analysis was used to examine the relationships between patients' rank of control of their chronic medical and psychiatric conditions compared to the age of onset and total number of conditions. One-hundred thirteen study participants reported having at least one chronic condition and seventy-four reported having at least one psychiatric disorder listed on the survey. Among the participants comorbid with both medical and psychiatric conditions, patients' ranking of control of their chronic conditions positively correlated with their ranking of control of their psychiatric disorders (p = 0.009). Patients' ranking of control of their chronic conditions negatively correlated with the total number of psychiatric disorders (p = 0.002). The study did not generate significant evidence to support the original hypothesis. The results highlight a strong relationship between patients' perceived control of their physical health and mental health. The comorbidity of both chronic conditions and psychiatric disorders may present challenges for patients. Utilizing a holistic approach to patient care can help clinicians improve patient outcomes.","['Patel, Pooja', 'Mancuso, Alison']","['Patel P', 'Mancuso A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Rutgers University New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey.', 'Department of Family Medicine, Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine, Stratford, New Jersey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20220621,England,Psychol Health Med,"Psychology, health & medicine",9604099,IM,"['Humans', '*Mental Health', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology/diagnosis', 'Health Status', 'Comorbidity', 'Chronic Disease']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic conditions', 'holistic approach', 'mental health', 'psychiatric disorders', 'psychiatry']",2022/06/22 06:00,2023/06/12 06:42,['2022/06/21 07:42'],"['2023/06/12 06:42 [medline]', '2022/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/06/21 07:42 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13548506.2022.2088815 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychol Health Med. 2023 Jul;28(6):1421-1429. doi: 10.1080/13548506.2022.2088815.

This study is the first to examine an existing stress-model from the general population, in patients diagnosed with adjustment disorders, using a longitudinal design. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 108 patients consecutively admitted for adjustment disorders. Associations of stress perception, emotional distress, resources, and mental health were measured at three time points: the outpatients' presentation, admission for inpatient treatment, and discharge from the hospital. To evaluate a longitudinal stress model of ADs, we examined whether stress at admission predicted mental health at each of the three time points using multiple linear regressions and structural equation modeling. A series of repeated-measures one-way analyses of variance (rANOVAs) was performed to assess change over time. RESULTS: Significant within-participant changes from baseline were observed between hospital admission and discharge with regard to mental health, stress perception, and emotional distress (p<0.001). Stress perception explained nearly half of the total variance (44%) of mental health at baseline; the adjusted R2 increased (0.48), taking emotional distress (i.e., depressive symptoms) into account. The best predictor of mental health at discharge was the level of emotional distress (i.e., anxiety level) at baseline (beta= -0.23, R2corr=0.56, p<0.001). With a CFI of 0.86 and an NFI of 0.86, the fit indices did not allow for acceptance of the stress-model (Cmin/df=15.26; RMSEA=0.21). CONCLUSIONS: Stress perception is an important predictor in adjustment disorders, and mental health-related treatment goals are dependent on and significantly impacted by stress perception and emotional distress.","['Kocalevent, Ruya-Daniela', 'Mierke, Annett', 'Danzer, Gerhard', 'Klapp, Burghard F']","['Kocalevent RD', 'Mierke A', 'Danzer G', 'Klapp BF']","['Institute and Policlinic for Medical Psychology, University Medical Center, Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.', 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140513,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adjustment Disorders/*etiology/*physiopathology', 'Affective Symptoms/physiopathology', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Stress, Psychological/*physiopathology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors']",PMC4019534,,,,2014/05/16 06:00,2014/12/31 06:00,['2014/05/15 06:00'],"['2013/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-13-44506 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0097303 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 May 13;9(5):e97303. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0097303. eCollection 2014.,5,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,['PLoS One. 2014;9(6):e101377'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since timely tracking of these disease patterns is crucial to disaster planning, response, and recovery, syndromic surveillance keyword filters were developed by the New York State Department of Health to study the short- and long-term impacts of Hurricane Sandy. Emergency department syndromic surveillance is recognized as a valuable tool for informing public health activities during and immediately following a disaster. Data typically consist of daily visit reports from hospital emergency departments (EDs) of basic patient data and free-text chief complaints. To develop keyword lists, comparisons were made with existing CDC categories and then integrated with lists from the New York City and New Jersey health departments in a collaborative effort. Two comprehensive lists were developed, each containing multiple subcategories and over 100 keywords for both mental health and injury. The data classifiers using these keywords were used to assess impacts of Sandy on mental health and injuries in New York State. The lists will be validated by comparing the ED chief complaint keyword with the final ICD diagnosis code.

LD score regression was used to investigate genetic correlations between neuroticism and the 34 health outcomes. Mendelian randomization was performed to investigate mutual causal relationships between neuroticism and the 34 health outcomes. Neuroticism genetically correlates with a majority of health-related traits and confers causal effects on 12 mental traits (major depressive disorder (MDD), insomnia, subjective well-being (SWB, negatively), schizophrenia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, alcohol dependence, loneliness, anorexia nervosa, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychiatric disorders) and two physical diseases (cardiovascular disease and hypertensive disease). Conversely, MDD, SWB, and insomnia have a causal effect on neuroticism. We highlighted key genes contributing to the causal associations between neuroticism and MDD, including RBFOX1, RERE, SOX5, and TCF4, and those contributing to the causal associations between neuroticism and cardiovascular diseases, including MAD1L1, ARNTL, RERE, and SOX6.

Little evidence regarding alignment or differential advantages of instruments or items has appeared to date. AIMS: Population-based psychometric study of items employed in public mental health narratives. METHOD: Multidimensional item response theory was applied to General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) and EQ-5D items (Health Survey for England, 2010-2012; n = 19 290). RESULTS: A bifactor model provided the best account of the data and showed that the GHQ-12 and WEMWBS items assess mainly the same construct. Only one item of the EQ-5D showed relevant overlap with this dimension (anxiety/depression). Findings were corroborated by comparisons with alternative models and cross-validation analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The consequences of this lack of differentiation (GHQ-12 v.

METHODS: Electronic health record data from several US healthcare systems were used to compare outcomes of four groups of patients who underwent bariatric surgery in 2012 and 2013. These included the following: people with (1) no mental illness, (2) mild-to-moderate depression or anxiety, (3) severe depression or anxiety, and (4) bipolar, psychosis, or schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Groups were compared on weight loss trajectory using generalized estimating equations using B-spline bases and on all-cause emergency department visits and hospital days using zero-inflated Poisson and negative binomial regression up to 2 years after surgery. Models were adjusted for demographic and health covariates, including baseline healthcare use. RESULTS: Among 8,192 patients, mean age was 44.3 (10.7) years, 79.9% were female, and 45.6% were white. Fifty-seven percent had preoperative mental illness. There were no differences between groups for weight loss, but patients with preoperative severe depression or anxiety or bipolar, psychosis, or schizophrenia spectrum disorders had higher follow-up levels of emergency department visits and hospital days compared to those with no mental illness. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter study, mental illness was not associated with differential weight loss after bariatric surgery, but additional research could focus on reducing acute care use among these patients.","['Fisher, David', 'Coleman, Karen J', 'Arterburn, David E', 'Fischer, Heidi', 'Yamamoto, Ayae', 'Young, Deborah R', 'Sherwood, Nancy E', 'Trinacty, Connie Mah', 'Lewis, Kristina H']","['Fisher D', 'Coleman KJ', 'Arterburn DE', 'Fischer H', 'Yamamoto A', 'Young DR', 'Sherwood NE', 'Trinacty CM', 'Lewis KH']","['The Permanente Medical Group, Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente, Oakland, California, USA.', 'Department of Research and Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, California, USA.', 'Group Health Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Research and Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, California, USA.', 'Department of Research and Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, California, USA.', 'Department of Research and Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, California, USA.', 'HealthPartners Institute, Bloomington, Minnesota, USA.', 'Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research, Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.', 'Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Epidemiology & Prevention, Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.', 'Center for Clinical and Outcomes Research, Kaiser Permanente Georgia, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Obesity (Silver Spring),"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",101264860,IM,"['Adult', 'Bariatric Surgery/*methods', 'Cohort Studies', 'Depressive Disorder, Major/*complications', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*trends']",,,,,2017/04/26 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/04/26 06:00'],"['2016/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/oby.21814 [doi]'],ppublish,Obesity (Silver Spring). 2017 May;25(5):850-856. doi: 10.1002/oby.21814.,5,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4921-7230'],"['Obesity (Silver Spring). 2017 May;25(5):819.

In this paper, we present SituMan, a solution that provides situation awareness to MoodBuster, an ecological momentary assessment and intervention mobile application used to request self-assessments from patients in depression treatments. SituMan has a fuzzy inference engine to identify patient situations using context data gathered from the sensors embedded in mobile devices. Situations are specified jointly by the patient and mental health professional, and they can represent the patient's daily routine (e.g., ""studying"", ""at work"", ""working out""). MoodBuster requests mental status self-assessments from patients at adequate moments using situation awareness. In addition, SituMan saves and displays patient situations in a summary, delivering them for consultation by mental health professionals. A first experimental evaluation was performed to assess the user satisfaction with the approaches to define and identify situations. This experiment showed that SituMan was well evaluated in both criteria. A second experiment was performed to assess the accuracy of the fuzzy engine to infer situations. Results from the second experiment showed that the fuzzy inference engine has a good accuracy to identify situations.","['Soares Teles, Ariel', 'Rocha, Artur', 'Jose da Silva E Silva, Francisco', 'Correia Lopes, Joao', ""O'Sullivan, Donal"", 'Van de Ven, Pepijn', 'Endler, Markus']","['Soares Teles A', 'Rocha A', 'Jose da Silva E Silva F', 'Correia Lopes J', ""O'Sullivan D"", 'Van de Ven P', 'Endler M']","['Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering, Federal University of Maranhao, 65080-805 Sao Luis, Brazil. ariel@lsdi.ufma.br.', 'Centre for Information Systems and Computer Graphics, Institute for Systems Engineering and Computers, Technology and Science, 4200-465 Porto, Portugal. artur.rocha@inesctec.pt.', 'Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering, Federal University of Maranhao, 65080-805 Sao Luis, Brazil. fssilva@lsdi.ufma.br.', 'Centre for Information Systems and Computer Graphics, Institute for Systems Engineering and Computers, Technology and Science, 4200-465 Porto, Portugal. jlopes@fe.up.pt.', 'Department of Informatics Engineering, Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto, 4200-465 Porto, Portugal. jlopes@fe.up.pt.', 'Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Limerick, V94 T9PX Limerick, Ireland. donal.osullivan@ul.ie.', 'Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Limerick, V94 T9PX Limerick, Ireland. pepijn.vandeven@ul.ie.', 'Department of Informatics, Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro, 22453-900 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. endler@inf.puc-rio.br.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170110,Switzerland,Sensors (Basel),"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",101204366,IM,"['Awareness', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders', '*Mental Health', 'Mobile Applications']",PMC5298700,,['NOTNLM'],"['ecological momentary assessment', 'fuzzy logic', 'mental disorder treatment', 'mobile mental health', 'situation awareness']",2017/01/12 06:00,2018/05/18 06:00,['2017/01/12 06:00'],"['2016/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['s17010127 [pii]', 'sensors-17-00127 [pii]', '10.3390/s17010127 [doi]']",epublish,Sensors (Basel). 2017 Jan 10;17(1):127. doi: 10.3390/s17010127.,1,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective cohort study of 2016-2017 Medicare data to compare the prevalence of physical and mental health conditions in a national sample of autistic older adults (N = 4685) to a matched population comparison (N = 46,850) cohort. Autistic older adults had significantly greater odds of nearly all physical health conditions including epilepsy (odds ratio = 18.9; 95% confidence interval = 17.2-20.7), Parkinson's disease (odds ratio = 6.1; 95% confidence interval = 5.3-7.0), and gastrointestinal conditions (odds ratio = 5.2; 95% confidence interval = 4.9-5.5). Most mental health conditions were more common among autistic older adults, including schizophrenia and psychotic disorders (odds ratio = 25.3; 95% confidence interval = 22.4-28.7), attention deficit disorders (odds ratio = 24.4; 95% confidence interval = 16.2-31.0), personality disorders (odds ratio = 24.1; 95% confidence interval = 17.8-32.5), and suicidality or self-inflicted injury (odds ratio = 11.1; 95% confidence interval = 8.9-13.8). Health conditions commonly associated with advanced age in the general population (e.g. osteoporosis, cognitive disorders, heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, osteoarthritis) were also significantly more common among autistic older adults. By highlighting the significant physical and mental health needs for which autistic older adults require care, our findings can inform healthcare systems, healthcare providers, and public health initiatives seeking to promote well-being in this growing population.","['Hand, Brittany N', 'Angell, Amber M', 'Harris, Lauren', 'Carpenter, Laura Arnstein']","['Hand BN', 'Angell AM', 'Harris L', 'Carpenter LA']","['The Ohio State University, USA.', 'University of Florida, USA.', 'The Ohio State University, USA.', 'Medical University of South Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191127,England,Autism,Autism : the international journal of research and practice,9713494,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autistic Disorder/*epidemiology', 'Comorbidity', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medicare/*statistics & numerical data', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC7433648,,['NOTNLM'],"['adults', 'autism spectrum disorders', 'health services', 'medical comorbidity', 'psychiatric comorbidity']",2019/11/28 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2019/11/28 06:00'],"['2019/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1177_1362361319890793 [pii]', '10.1177/1362361319890793 [doi]']",ppublish,Autism. 2020 Apr;24(3):755-764. doi: 10.1177/1362361319890793.

Yet, no comprehensive study has been conducted on the overall quality of mental health information searched for online. This study examined the first 20 search results of two popular search engines-Google and Bing-for 11 common mental health terms. They were analyzed using the DISCERN instrument, an adaptation of the Depression Website Content Checklist (ADWCC), Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level readability measures, HONCode badge display, and commercial status, resulting in an analysis of 440 web pages. Quality of Web site results varied based on type of disorder examined, with higher quality Web sites found for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and dysthymia, and lower quality ratings for phobia, anxiety, and panic disorder Web sites. Of the total Web sites analyzed, 67.5% had good or better quality content. Nearly one-third of the search results produced Web sites from three entities: WebMD, Wikipedia, and the Mayo Clinic. The mean Flesch Reading Ease score was 41.21, and the mean Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score was 11.68. The presence of the HONCode badge and noncommercial status was found to have a small correlation with Web site quality, and Web sites displaying the HONCode badge and commercial sites had lower readability scores. Popular search engines appear to offer generally reliable results pointing to mostly good or better quality mental health Web sites. However, additional work is needed to make these sites more readable.","['Grohol, John M', 'Slimowicz, Joseph', 'Granda, Rebecca']","['Grohol JM', 'Slimowicz J', 'Granda R']","['1 Psych Central , Newburyport, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20131116,United States,Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw,"Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",101528721,IM,"['*Comprehension', 'Humans', '*Information Dissemination', '*Internet', '*Mental Health']",,,,,2013/11/19 06:00,2015/01/02 06:00,['2013/11/19 06:00'],"['2013/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cyber.2013.0258 [doi]'],ppublish,Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw. 2014 Apr;17(4):216-21. doi: 10.1089/cyber.2013.0258.

At the beginning of this millenium, with much improved scientific knowledge, experience and possibilities, but confronted with new challenges we are observing the tempestuous historical features which have influenced the development of mental health care. Mental health is crucial for the welfare of a society and its individuals, since such disorders are not only the cause of emotional suffering, but they also deteriorate the quality of life, cause alienation and discrimination of an individual. At the same time, they are a great economic burden to the society as they require long-term therapy and often result in poor productivity. In order to decrease the burden of mental disorders it is required to stimulate prevention and improvement of mental health of the population within the framework of national policies, legislation and financing.","['Backovic, Dusan']",['Backovic D'],"['Institut za higijenu i medicinsku ekologiju, Medicinski fakultet, Beograd. dbacko@ptt.rs']",['srp'],,"['English Abstract', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,Serbia,Med Pregl,Medicinski pregled,2985249R,IM,"['Health Promotion/history', 'History, 18th Century', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*history', 'Mental Health/*history', 'World Health Organization/history']",,,,,2011/05/11 06:00,2011/06/08 06:00,['2011/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/mpns1012833b [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pregl. 2010 Nov-Dec;63(11-12):833-8. doi: 10.2298/mpns1012833b.,11-12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Qualitative descriptive and interpretative content analysis was used. Stigmatization of users is shaping up in their trajectory in the health center. Identity changes from person to ""patient,"" which generates dependence on the expert role of healthcare professionals. Stigma is expressed in the interactions between a health institution, a professional team, and a user, reproducing power and control relationships associated with the biomedical model and reinforcing a cycle of chronification in the user.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of U.S. SMs who served on active duty from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010. The exposed cohort consisted of SMs who received an incident diagnosis of TBI during the exposure period. The unexposed cohort was populated with a 10% random sample of SMs with any other medical diagnosis over the exposure period. RESULTS: After adjusting for various demographic factors, TBI severity, historic diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), comorbid PTSD, and comorbid mental health outcomes, the TBI cohort (n = 53,817) demonstrated elevated incident rate ratio of developing AUD (adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) 1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4, 1.6, p < 0.0001) as compared to an unexposed cohort (n = 151,776). The TBI cohort did not demonstrate elevated risk of ODUD as compared to the unexposed cohort (adjusted IRR 1.0, 95% CI 1.0, 1.2, p = 0.178).

Many are instead seeking support and information regarding their mental health via the Web, especially via social networking sites (SNSs), and hence, there is a promising opportunity to use SNSs to deliver or integrate with youth-focused online mental health interventions. Previous reviews have evaluated the effectiveness of SNSs for specific disorders in young people; however, none of the reviews have covered the breadth of SNS-based youth mental health interventions available across all mental health issues. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to systematically identify available evidence regarding the use of SNS-based interventions to support the mental health of young people aged up to 25 years, to evaluate their effectiveness, suitability, and safety, and identify gaps and opportunities for future research. METHODS: The PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched using Medical Subject Headings terms and exploded keywords and phrases. Retrieved abstracts (n=974) were double screened, yielding 235 articles for screening at the full-text level. Of these, 9 articles met the review inclusion criteria. Given the small number of studies, and the variety of outcome measures used, a quantitative meta-analysis was not possible. RESULTS: The 9 articles (quantitative studies, qualitative studies, and descriptions of the iterative design process) covered 5 separate interventions. Of the 5 interventions, 2 interventions used purpose-built platforms based on the moderated online social therapy (MOST) model, 2 used Facebook, and 1 evaluated a purpose-built mobile app. The 2 MOST interventions targeted specific mental health issues (depression and psychosis), whereas the others focused on improving mental health literacy, social support, and general well-being. Only 3 quantitative studies were identified, and all used a pre-post design (without a control group) to establish proof of concept. Of the outcome variables assessed, there were significant improvements in mental health knowledge and number of depressive symptoms but no improvement in anxiety or psychosis symptoms. Acceptability of and engagement with the SNS platforms were generally high, as were perceptions of usefulness and safety. Moderation by clinical experts was identified as a key component of the more successful interventions. When offered a choice, users showed a preference for mobile apps over Web-based interfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence reviewed suggests young people find SNS-based interventions highly usable, engaging, and supportive. However, future studies need to address the current lack of high-quality evidence for their efficacy in reducing mental health symptoms. Given young people are already turning to SNSs to engage in knowledge seeking and peer-to-peer support, SNS-based youth mental health interventions provide an opportunity to address some of the barriers young people face in accessing qualified mental health support and information.","['Ridout, Brad', 'Campbell, Andrew']","['Ridout B', 'Campbell A']","['Cyberpsychology Research Group, Faculty of Health Sciences, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Cyberpsychology Research Group, Faculty of Health Sciences, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20181218,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', '*Social Networking', 'Young Adult']",PMC6315265,,['NOTNLM'],"['mental health', 'social media', 'social networking', 'social support', 'support groups']",2018/12/20 06:00,2019/10/08 06:00,['2018/12/20 06:00'],"['2018/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['v20i12e12244 [pii]', '10.2196/12244 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2018 Dec 18;20(12):e12244. doi: 10.2196/12244.,12,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8067-0490', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2217-2589']",,['Conflicts of Interest: None declared.'],"['(c)Brad Ridout, Andrew Campbell.

METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WANFANG DATA, and VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals were searched for articles published from January 1, 2019, to April 19, 2020. The prevalence estimates of adverse mental health symptoms in medical staff were pooled using the random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 35 articles and data of 25,343 medical staff were used in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence estimates in medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic were as follows (ordered from high to low): fear-related symptoms, 67% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 61%-73%); high levels of perceived stress, 56% (95% CI = 32%-79%), anxiety symptoms, 41% (95% CI = 35%-47%); insomnia, 41% (95% CI = 33%-50%); posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, 38% (95% CI = 34%-43%); depressive symptoms, 27% (95% CI = 20%-34%); and somatic symptoms, 16% (95% CI = 3%-36%). The subgroup analysis revealed that the prevalence estimates of fear-related symptoms were consistently high. CONCLUSIONS: Medical staff during the COVID-19 epidemic have a high prevalence of adverse mental health symptoms.

A key limitation is clinicians' reluctance to include MAT in their routine practice due, in part, to low confidence about managing SUDs and limited awareness of the disease model of addiction. This study evaluates the impact of a 1-day MAT training for community mental health clinicians using a 30-item pre- and post-training questionnaire. Of the 109 clinicians who attended the training, 107 completed the pre- and post-training questionnaires. Factor analysis of the questionnaire identified two domains: readiness to address SUDs among patients (factor 1) and understanding SUDs as diseases (factor 2). Post training, there was a significant change in both factor 1 (p = .00001) and factor 2 (p = .00003), indicating that a brief MAT training can increase clinicians' confidence and readiness to address SUDs and improve their understanding of the disease model of addiction.","['Iheanacho, Theddeus', 'Bommersbach, Tanner', 'Fuehrlein, Brian', 'Arnaout, Bachaar', 'Dike, Charles']","['Iheanacho T', 'Bommersbach T', 'Fuehrlein B', 'Arnaout B', 'Dike C']","['Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA. theddeus.iheanacho@yale.edu.', 'VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA. theddeus.iheanacho@yale.edu.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, 300 George Street, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA. theddeus.iheanacho@yale.edu.', 'Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA.', 'Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA.', 'Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', ""Connecticut's Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, Hartford, CT, USA.""]",['eng'],['R25 DA035163/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200215,United States,Community Ment Health J,Community mental health journal,0005735,IM,"['Crisis Intervention', 'Humans', '*Mental Health', '*Substance-Related Disorders/drug therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC7429311,['NIHMS1585175'],['NOTNLM'],"['Addiction', 'Community mental health', 'Medication-assisted treatment', 'Substance use disorder', 'Training']",2020/02/18 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/02/17 06:00'],"['2019/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10597-020-00586-8 [pii]', '10.1007/s10597-020-00586-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Community Ment Health J. 2020 Nov;56(8):1429-1435. doi: 10.1007/s10597-020-00586-8.

Movement-based and mind body-focused practices, such as yoga, may play an important role as complementary mental health supports for refugees. Data on the effectiveness of these practices in these populations are limited, and further research is needed. However, these practices can still be introduced in a safe way by trained professionals and offered as adjunctive therapeutic approaches to traditional Western psychotherapy options.

The exposure to preflight, flight, and resettlement stressors puts refugee children and their families at risk of developing emotional and behavioral disorders. A unique Western-based approach of mental health problems seems to be insufficient to address the complexity of interactions between individual vulnerabilities and more ecological surrounding systems. We looked into (1) the reasons for referral; and (2) the process diagnostic outcomes after ethnopsychiatric and psychological assessment. We conducted a thematic content analysis on 93 files of refugee children. The findings suggest that mental health care professionals need to hold into account the multiplicity and intertwining of ongoing challenges to the well-being of refugee children. The integration of a Western-based psychiatric assessment with a more ecologically based view can lead to a more culturally sensitive approach in refugee children and their families. This way, both under- and overdiagnosis of psychiatric disorders could be avoided to further optimalise mental health care in this population.","[""Villanueva O'Driscoll, Julia"", 'Serneels, Geertrui', 'Imeraj, Lindita']","[""Villanueva O'Driscoll J"", 'Serneels G', 'Imeraj L']","['Solentra vzw, Child and Adolescent Department (PAika), Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 101, 1090, Jette, Belgium. jvillanu@vub.ac.be.', 'Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Pleinlaan 2, 1050, Elsene, Belgium. jvillanu@vub.ac.be.', 'Solentra vzw, Child and Adolescent Department (PAika), Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 101, 1090, Jette, Belgium.', 'Solentra vzw, Child and Adolescent Department (PAika), Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 101, 1090, Jette, Belgium.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 101, 1090, Jette, Belgium.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170407,Germany,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,European child & adolescent psychiatry,9212296,IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Mental Health Services/*standards', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Refugees/*psychology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Culturally sensitive approach', 'Ecological framework', 'File study', 'Mental health care', 'Refugee children', 'Refugees']",2017/04/09 06:00,2018/03/10 06:00,['2017/04/09 06:00'],"['2016/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00787-017-0981-3 [pii]', '10.1007/s00787-017-0981-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2017 Nov;26(11):1331-1341. doi: 10.1007/s00787-017-0981-3.

Studies carried out in Kenya suggest a need for a robust service for the treatment, prevention, and promotion of child and adolescent mental health. Despite a few existing services to provide treatment and management of mental health disorders, we need more knowledge about their effectiveness in the management of these disorders. This paper describes a study protocol that aims to evaluate the process and outcomes of psychotherapies offered to children and adolescents seeking mental health services at the Kenyatta National Hospital in Kenya. METHODS: This study will use a prospective cohort approach that will follow adolescent patients (12-17 years of age) receiving mental health services in the youth clinics at the Kenyatta National Hospital for a period of 12 months. During this time a mixed methods research will be carried out, focusing on treatment outcomes, therapeutic relationship, understanding of psychotherapy, and other mental health interventions offered to the young patients. In this proposed study, we define outcome as the alleviation of symptoms, which will be assessed quantitatively using longitudinal patient data collected session-wise. Process refers to the mechanisms identified to promote change in the adolescent. For example, individual participant or clinician characteristics, therapeutic alliance will be assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. In each session, assessments will be used to reduce problems due to attrition and to enable calculation of longitudinal change trajectories using growth curve modeling. For this study, these will be referred to as session-wise assessments. Qualitative work will include interviews with adolescent patients, their caregivers as well as feedback from the mental health care providers on existing services and their barriers to providing care. CONCLUSION: This study aims to understand the mechanisms through which change takes place beyond the context of psychotherapy. What are the moderators and through which mechanisms do they operate to improve mental health outcomes in young people?","['Wambua, Grace Nduku', 'Kumar, Manasi', 'Falkenstrom, Fredrik', 'Cuijpers, Pim']","['Wambua GN', 'Kumar M', 'Falkenstrom F', 'Cuijpers P']","['Department of Clinical, Neuro and Developmental Psychology, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. wambua.nduku@gmail.com.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Department of Behavioral Sciences and Learning, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical, Neuro and Developmental Psychology, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200527,England,BMC Psychiatry,BMC psychiatry,100968559,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kenya', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Mental Health Services/*standards', 'Prospective Studies', '*Psychotherapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC7251869,,['NOTNLM'],"['Child and adolescent mental health', 'Outcomes', 'Process', 'Psychotherapy']",2020/05/29 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2019/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12888-020-02611-2 [pii]', '2611 [pii]', '10.1186/s12888-020-02611-2 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Psychiatry. 2020 May 27;20(1):263. doi: 10.1186/s12888-020-02611-2.,1,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1795-6634'],,['The authors declare that there are no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, there is preliminary evidence to support the possibility of epigenetic mediation: environmental factors are reported to influence offspring DNAm, which in turn associate with child and adolescent psychopathology. However, all analyses have been correlational in nature and, as these studies have focussed on children and adolescents, DNAm has been based on peripheral tissue (cord blood, whole blood, buccal cells). Therefore, the extent to which DNAm could represent a causal mechanism (e.g., a surrogate of central nervous system function) or a biomarker (i.e., an indicator of the pathological process leading to disease) is unclear. This short report has 2 main components. First, 2 studies are summarized, one a candidate gene study and the other an epigenome-wide association study in which DNAm was reported to (partially) mediate the link between adversity and child development. Second, there is a discussion of (1) the ""tissue issue,"" (2) maximizing the interpretability of candidate gene and epigenome-wide approaches, and (3) the need for examining DNAm as a potential biomarker for mental health. It is argued that advances within these 3 areas will make clearer the role of DNAm in the link between adversity and child and adolescent mental health.","['Barker, Edward D']",['Barker ED'],,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180223,Switzerland,Psychopathology,Psychopathology,8401537,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Epigenomics/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Mouth Mucosa', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorders/*diagnosis/pathology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adolescence', 'Adversity', 'Biomarker', 'Childhood', 'DNA methylation', 'Developmental psychopathology', 'Epigenetics', 'Mediator']",2018/02/27 06:00,2018/07/18 06:00,['2018/02/26 06:00'],"['2017/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/02/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['000486683 [pii]', '10.1159/000486683 [doi]']",ppublish,Psychopathology. 2018;51(2):71-75. doi: 10.1159/000486683.

Arts-based groups provide opportunities for shared emotional experiences and emotion regulation. This study explores emotion regulation strategies and the emotional effects of arts-based group participation in adults with mental health problems and in controls. DESIGN AND METHOD: The 62 participants included 39 adults with chronic mental health problems who were members of arts-based groups (ABG) and 23 comparison choir (CC) members who were not specifically experiencing mental health problems. The repeated measures design included self-reports of emotion upon waking (T1), the hour before group (T2), end of the group (T3), and evening (T4), as well as participant notes to explain their emotion ratings at each time. They also completed measures of individual and interpersonal emotion regulation. RESULTS: The ABG participants engaged marginally more in affect worsening strategies than CC (p = .057 and .08), but there were no other group differences. All participants reported a significant increase in positive emotions, F (3, 180) = 28.044, p < .001, np2 = .319; and a decrease in negative emotions during the arts-based activity: F (2.637, 155.597) = 21.09, p < .001, np2 = .263. The influence on positive emotions was short-lived, while the effect on negative emotions lasted until evening. CONCLUSION: Findings show that participation in arts-based groups benefits the emotions of both healthy adults and those experiencing mental health conditions through individual and interpersonal processes.

SUD is often comorbid with significant mental health challenges, trauma and negative social determinants of health. SUDs contribute to increased burden of chronic disease and can lead to increased mortality and shorter life expectancy, not just through overdose but also through increased rates of mental and physical chronic disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to explore the evidence regarding lifestyle interventions as either primary interventions or adjuncts to existing treatments for individuals with SUD. DISCUSSION: Lifestyle interventions can play a significant part in the management of people with SUD. These interventions play a part in SUD treatment and relapse prevention as well as improving physical and mental health and quality of life. These interventions ideally can be instituted and managed through community services and primary care.","['Naren, Thileepan', 'Cook, Jon', 'Armstrong, Ferghal', 'Manger, Sam']","['Naren T', 'Cook J', 'Armstrong F', 'Manger S']","['MBBS, MHM, MPH, FACRRM, FRACGP, FASLM, GAICD, Addiction Medicine Advanced Trainee, Western Health, St Albans, Vic; Host, Cracking Addiction Podcast.', 'MBBS, FRACGP, FAChAM, Addiction Medicine Specialist, Head of Unit, Western Health, St Albans, Vic.', 'MB BCh BAO, MRCGP, DCH, DRCOG, Dip Occ Med, DPD, FAChAM, FASLM, General Practitioner and Addiction Medicine Specialist, Nyora Medical Centre, Nyora, Vic; Host, Cracking Addiction Podcast.', 'MBBS, BSc, FRACGP, FASLM, General Practitioner and Senior Lecturer, James Cook University, Townsville, Qld; President, The Australasian Society of Lifestyle Medicine; Host, The GP Show Podcast.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Australia,Aust J Gen Pract,Australian journal of general practice,101718099,IM,"['Comorbidity', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Mental Health', '*Quality of Life', '*Substance-Related Disorders/psychology']",,,,,2022/08/01 06:00,2022/08/03 06:00,['2022/07/31 20:02'],"['2022/07/31 20:02 [entrez]', '2022/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/08/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31128/AJGP-02-22-6331 [doi]'],ppublish,Aust J Gen Pract. 2022 Aug;51(8):560-564. doi: 10.31128/AJGP-02-22-6331.,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A substantial number of models experience mental health issues due to the nature of their occupation, however, most avoid speaking out due to fear of stigma and losing out on future work. Moreover, problematic eating behaviours in attempts to improve body image can have profoundly adverse effects on mental and physical health, even leading to death in extreme cases, yet these behaviours are being reinforced and rewarded with success and career progression. Indeed, the term 'Paris Thin' was used in relation to the deaths of models from starvation who were in pursuit of 'the perfect body' whilst working in France, the epicentre of the fashion world. Although improvements have been made over the past decade, conversations surrounding common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety remain minimal at best and discussions about other serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder are virtually absent. Campaigns that amplify the voices of models living with a mental health condition must therefore be supported to reduce mental health related stigma in the industry and encourage those who are suffering and struggling to seek professional help. Research in this area is urgently needed to yield new insights that will help to improve the mental health of models.","['Newby, Sorcha', 'Hankir, Ahmed', 'Zaman, Rashid']","['Newby S', 'Hankir A', 'Zaman R']","['De Montfort University, Leicester, UK, P1719245X@my365.dmu.ac.uk.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Croatia,Psychiatr Danub,Psychiatria Danubina,9424753,IM,"['Anxiety Disorders', 'Humans', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology', 'Mental Health', 'Paris', '*Schizophrenia', 'Social Stigma']",,,,,2021/12/05 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/12/04 12:04'],"['2021/12/04 12:04 [entrez]', '2021/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Psychiatr Danub. 2021 Dec;33(Suppl 11):133-136.,Suppl 11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a novel class of probiotics, the application of psychobiotics has led researchers to focus on a new area in neuroscience. In the past five years, some psychobiotics strains were reported to inhibit inflammation and decreased cortisol levels, resulting in an amelioration of the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Psychobiotics are efficacious in improving neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Use of psychobiotics can improve GI function, ASD symptoms, motor functions of patients with PD and cognition in patients with AD. However, the evidence for the effects of psychobiotics on mental and neurological conditions/disorders remains limited. Further studies of psychobiotics are needed in order to determine into their effectiveness and mechanism as treatments for various psychiatric disorders in the future.","['Cheng, Li-Hao', 'Liu, Yen-Wenn', 'Wu, Chien-Chen', 'Wang, Sabrina', 'Tsai, Ying-Chieh']","['Cheng LH', 'Liu YW', 'Wu CC', 'Wang S', 'Tsai YC']","['Bened Biomedical Co., Ltd., Taipei 10448, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 11221, Taiwan.', 'Microbiome Research Center, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 11221, Taiwan.', 'Bened Biomedical Co., Ltd., Taipei 10448, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 11221, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 11221, Taiwan.', 'Microbiome Research Center, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 11221, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190210,China (Republic : 1949- ),J Food Drug Anal,Journal of food and drug analysis,101630927,IM,"['Humans', '*Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorders/psychology/*therapy', '*Probiotics']",PMC9307042,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bifidobacterium', 'Lactobacillus', 'Probiotics', 'Psychiatric disorders', 'Psychobiotics']",2019/07/22 06:00,2020/07/08 06:00,['2019/07/21 06:00'],"['2018/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['j.jfda.2019.01.002 [pii]', 'jfda-27-03-632 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jfda.2019.01.002 [doi]']",ppublish,J Food Drug Anal. 2019 Jul;27(3):632-648. doi: 10.1016/j.jfda.2019.01.002.

We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of singleton infants born between the years of 1989 and 1993 using a linkage of the Nova Scotia Atlee Perinatal Database with administrative health data. Offspring were followed from birth to age 18 years. Maternal weight status was categorized according to WHO body mass index cutoffs. The number of physician visits for any mental health condition, mood, anxiety, and adjustment disorders, conduct disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from age 0-18 years was determined from ICD codes in physician billings and hospital discharge abstract data. Negative binomial regression adjusting for sociodemographics, maternal psychiatric disorders and smoking was used to model the association. In total, 38,211 mother-offspring pairs were included in the cohort. Within the first 18 years of life, offspring of mothers with obesity had significantly more physician visits for any mental health condition [adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.26, 95% CI 1.19-1.34], mood, anxiety, and adjustment disorders (IRR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07-1.25), conduct disorder (IRR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08-1.45), and ADHD (IRR 1.45, 95% CI 1.24-1.69) compared to mothers of normal weight. Associations for mood, anxiety, and adjustment disorders and conduct disorder were strongest at 13-18 years.

METHODS: We used a cohort study of Hurricane Ike survivors (n=508) to assess the spatial distribution of postdisaster mental health wellness (most likely resilience trajectory for posttraumatic stress symptoms [PTSS] and depression) and general wellness (most likely resilience trajectory for PTSS, depression, functional impairment, and days of poor health) in Galveston, Texas. We applied the spatial scan statistic (SaTScan) and geographically weighted regression. RESULTS: We found spatial clusters of high likelihood wellness in areas north of Texas City and spatial concentrations of low likelihood wellness in Galveston Island. Geographic variation was found in predictors of wellness, showing increasing associations with both forms of wellness the closer respondents were located to Galveston City in Galveston Island. CONCLUSIONS: Predictors for postdisaster wellness may manifest differently across geographic space with concentrations of lower likelihood wellness and increased associations with predictors in areas of higher exposure. Our approach could be used to inform geographically targeted interventions to promote mental health and general wellness in disaster-affected communities.","['Gruebner, Oliver', 'Lowe, Sarah R', 'Tracy, Melissa', 'Cerda, Magdalena', 'Joshi, Spruha', 'Norris, Fran H', 'Galea, Sandro']","['Gruebner O', 'Lowe SR', 'Tracy M', 'Cerda M', 'Joshi S', 'Norris FH', 'Galea S']","['1Department of Epidemiology,Mailman School of Public Health,Columbia University,New York,New York.', '1Department of Epidemiology,Mailman School of Public Health,Columbia University,New York,New York.', '2Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics,School of Public Health,University at Albany,State University of New York,Albany,New York.', '1Department of Epidemiology,Mailman School of Public Health,Columbia University,New York,New York.', '1Department of Epidemiology,Mailman School of Public Health,Columbia University,New York,New York.', '3Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth,Hanover,New Hampshire.', '4School of Public Health,Boston University,Boston,Massachusetts.']",['eng'],['T32-MH-13043/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20160128,United States,Disaster Med Public Health Prep,Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,101297401,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclonic Storms/*statistics & numerical data', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', '*Geography', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Resilience, Psychological', 'Risk Factors', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology/etiology', 'Stress, Psychological/etiology/psychology', 'Survivors/psychology', 'Texas/epidemiology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['geographic mapping', 'mental disorders', 'natural disasters', 'post-traumatic stress disorders', 'psychological resilience']",2016/01/29 06:00,2017/01/10 06:00,['2016/01/29 06:00'],"['2016/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S193578931500172X [pii]', '10.1017/dmp.2015.172 [doi]']",ppublish,Disaster Med Public Health Prep. 2016 Apr;10(2):261-73. doi: 10.1017/dmp.2015.172.

However, no measure is available to assess individual differences in the expansiveness or breadth of concepts of mental disorder. Four studies aimed to develop and validate two such measures. The Concept Breadth-Vertical (CB-V) scale assesses variability in the severity threshold at which unusual behavior or experience is judged to reflect disorder, whereas the Concept Breadth-Horizontal (CB-H) scale assesses variability in the range of phenomena judged to be disorders. METHODS: In a pilot study (N = 201) for the CB-V, participants read vignettes of varying severity for each of the 10 mental disorders, and rated whether the subject had a disorder. Study 1 (N = 502) used exploratory factor analyses to examine 10 CB-V items from the pilot study and 20 vignette-based items for constructing the CB-H. Study 2 (N = 298) employed confirmatory factor analysis to validate the scales' structure and examined their convergent validity with a measure of harm concept breadth and their discriminant validity with measures of mental health literacy. Study 3 (N = 298) explored associations of the scales with other mental health variables, including stigma and help-seeking attitudes. RESULTS: Study 1 supported the unifactorial structure of each item set, refined each set into a scale, and demonstrated acceptable reliabilities. Study 2 provided support for the scales' convergent and discriminant validities. Study 3 showed that the scales were associated negatively with stigma, and positively with help-seeking attitudes and self-reported mental health problems. Studies 2 and 3 further indicated that younger and more politically liberal participants hold broader concepts of mental disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The new concept breadth scales are psychometrically sound measures of a promising new concept in the study of beliefs and attitudes about mental health. Potential future research directions are discussed.","['Tse, Jesse S Y', 'Haslam, Nick']","['Tse JSY', 'Haslam N']","['Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, University of Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia. jtse@student.unimelb.edu.au.', 'Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, University of Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20231004,England,BMC Psychiatry,BMC psychiatry,100968559,IM,"['Humans', '*Individuality', 'Pilot Projects', '*Mental Disorders/diagnosis/psychology', 'Social Stigma', 'Mental Health']",PMC10548567,,['NOTNLM'],"['Concept breadth', 'Concept creep', 'Help-seeking attitudes', 'Mental disorder', 'Mental health literacy', 'Mental illness', 'Stigma']",2023/10/05 01:00,2023/10/06 06:43,['2023/10/04 23:37'],"['2023/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2023/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/10/06 06:43 [medline]', '2023/10/05 01:00 [pubmed]', '2023/10/04 23:37 [entrez]']","['10.1186/s12888-023-05152-6 [pii]', '5152 [pii]', '10.1186/s12888-023-05152-6 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Psychiatry. 2023 Oct 4;23(1):718. doi: 10.1186/s12888-023-05152-6.,1,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3912-1515', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1913-2340']",,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],"['(c) 2023.

Efforts to locally validate mental health assessments are of particular value, yet gold-standard clinical validation is costly, time-intensive, and reliant on available professionals. This study aimed to validate assessment items for mental distress in Kenya, using an innovative gold standard and a combination of culturally adapted and locally developed items. The mixed-method study drew on surveys and semi-structured interviews, conducted by lay interviewers, with 48 caregivers. Interviews were used to designate mental health ""cases"" or ""non-cases"" based on emotional health problems, identified through a collaborative clinical rating process with local input. Individual mental health survey items were evaluated for their ability to discriminate between cases and non-cases. Discriminant survey items included 23 items adapted from existing mental health assessment tools, as well as 6 new items developed for the specific cultural context. When items were combined into a scale, results showed good psychometric properties. The use of clinically rated semi-structured interviews provides a promising alternative gold standard that can help address the challenges of conducting diagnostic clinical validation in low-resource settings.","['Watson, Leah K', 'Kaiser, Bonnie N', 'Giusto, Ali M', 'Ayuku, David', 'Puffer, Eve S']","['Watson LK', 'Kaiser BN', 'Giusto AM', 'Ayuku D', 'Puffer ES']","[""Centre for Global Health Research, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada."", 'Duke Global Health Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke Global Health Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Anthropology, Global Health Program, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Duke Global Health Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'College of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, Department of Behavioral Sciences, Moi University, Eldoret, Kenya.', 'Duke Global Health Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['F32 MH113288/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 MH096724/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 MH08091607/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'Duke Global Health Institute, Duke University/']",['Journal Article'],20190617,England,Int J Psychol,International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie,0107305,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kenya', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychometrics/*methods', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC7321828,['NIHMS1588501'],['NOTNLM'],"['Family functioning', 'Kenya', 'Measure development', 'Mental health', 'Validation']",2019/06/19 06:00,2020/07/16 06:00,['2019/06/19 06:00'],"['2018/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijop.12604 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Psychol. 2020 Jun;55(3):425-434. doi: 10.1002/ijop.12604.

Owing to the high and growing demand for mental health care, a large number of such information and communication technology systems have been developed in recent years. Consequently, a diverse system landscape formed. OBJECTIVE: This literature review aims to give an overview of this landscape of e-mental health systems for the prevention and treatment of major depressive disorder, focusing on three main research questions: (1) What types of systems exist? (2) How technologically advanced are these systems? (3) How has the system landscape evolved between 2000 and 2017? METHODS: Publications eligible for inclusion described e-mental health software for the prevention or treatment of major depressive disorder. Additionally, the software had to have been evaluated with end users and developed since 2000. After screening, 270 records remained for inclusion. We constructed a taxonomy concerning software systems, their functions, how technologized these were in their realization, and how systems were evaluated, and then, we extracted this information from the included records. We define here as functions any component of the system that delivers either treatment or adherence support to the user. For this coding process, an elaborate classification hierarchy for functions was developed yielding a total of 133 systems with 2163 functions. The systems and their functions were analyzed quantitatively, with a focus on technological realization. RESULTS: There are various types of systems. However, most are delivered on the World Wide Web (76%), and most implement cognitive behavioral therapy techniques (85%). In terms of content, systems contain twice as many treatment functions as adherence support functions, on average. Furthermore, autonomous systems, those not including human guidance, are equally as technologized and have one-third less functions than guided ones. Therefore, lack of guidance is neither compensated with additional functions nor compensated by technologizing functions to a greater degree. Although several high-tech solutions could be found, the average system falls between a purely informational system and one that allows for data entry but without automatically processing these data. Moreover, no clear increase in the technological capabilities of systems showed in the field, between 2000 and 2017, despite a marked growth in system quantity. Finally, more sophisticated systems were evaluated less often in comparative trials than less sophisticated ones (OR 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that when developers create systems, there is a greater focus on implementing therapeutic treatment than adherence support. Although the field is very active, as evidenced by the growing number of systems developed per year, the technological possibilities explored are limited. In addition to allowing developers to compare their system with others, we anticipate that this review will help researchers identify opportunities in the field.","['Burger, Franziska', 'Neerincx, Mark A', 'Brinkman, Willem-Paul']","['Burger F', 'Neerincx MA', 'Brinkman WP']","['Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands.', 'Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands.', 'Nederlandse Organisatie voor Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek (TNO), Department of Perceptual and Cognitive Systems, Soesterberg, Netherlands.', 'Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20200120,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,IM,"['Depressive Disorder, Major/psychology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Telemedicine/*methods']",PMC6997926,,['NOTNLM'],"['eHealth', 'major depressive disorder', 'systematic review', 'technology']",2020/01/21 06:00,2020/07/31 06:00,['2020/01/21 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['v22i1e12599 [pii]', '10.2196/12599 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2020 Jan 20;22(1):e12599. doi: 10.2196/12599.,1,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0184-382X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8161-5722', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8485-7092']",,['Conflicts of Interest: None declared.'],"['(c)Franziska Burger, Mark A Neerincx, Willem-Paul Brinkman.

However, the prevalence of severe mental disorder in adolescents (2%), is too low for specialised CAMHC to be offered in each of the 390 Dutch municipalities. CAMHC needs to be organised at a supraregional level. Since the introduction of the Youth Act there has been a disturbing lack of coherence and a time- and money-devouring new bureaucracy at this level that threatens the survival of CAMHC.

The objective was to estimate the association between heavy metals and metalloids in soil and the prevalence of mental disorders in the adult population of Spain. METHODS: Individual data came from the Spanish National Health Survey 2011-2012, 18,073 individuals residing in 1772 census sections. Mental health was measured with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. The concentration estimates of heavy metal and metalloid levels in topsoil (upper soil horizon) came from the Geochemical Atlas of Spain based on 13,317 soil samples. Levels of lead (Pb), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd) and manganese (Mn) were estimated in each census section by ""ordinary Kriging"". Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by multilevel logistic regression models. RESULTS: Compared with the lowest Pb concentration levels quartile, the OR for the second quartile was 1.29 (95%CI: 1.11-1.50), increasing progressively to 1.37 (95%CI: 1.17-1.60) and 1.51 (95%CI: 1.27-1.79) in the third and fourth quartiles, respectively. For As, the association was observed in the third and fourth quartiles: 1.21 (95%CI: 1.04-1.41) and 1.42 (95% CI: 1.21-1.65), respectively. Cd was associated also following a gradient from the second quartile: 1.34 (95%CI: 1.15-1.57) through the fourth: 1.84 (95%CI: 1.56-2.15). In contrast, Mn only showed a positive association at the second quartile. Additionally, individuals consuming vegetables > once a day the OR for the fourth quartile of Pb concentration, vs. the first, increased to 2.93 (95%CI: 1.97-4.36); similarly for As: 3.00 (95%CI: 2.08-4.31), and for Cd: 3.49 (95%CI: 2.33-5.22). CONCLUSIONS: Living in areas with a higher concentration of heavy metals and metalloids in soil was associated with an increased probability of having a mental disorder. These relationships were strengthened in individuals reporting consuming vegetables > once a day.","['Ayuso-Alvarez, A', 'Simon, L', 'Nunez, O', 'Rodriguez-Blazquez, C', 'Martin-Mendez, I', 'Bel-Lan, A', 'Lopez-Abente, G', 'Merlo, J', 'Fernandez-Navarro, P', 'Galan, I']","['Ayuso-Alvarez A', 'Simon L', 'Nunez O', 'Rodriguez-Blazquez C', 'Martin-Mendez I', 'Bel-Lan A', 'Lopez-Abente G', 'Merlo J', 'Fernandez-Navarro P', 'Galan I']","['Department of Chronic Diseases, National Centre for Epidemiology, Institute of Health Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Autonomous University of Madrid/IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Chronic Diseases, National Centre for Epidemiology, Institute of Health Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cancer & Environmental Epidemiology Unit, National Centre for Epidemiology, Institute of Health Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Chronic Diseases, National Centre for Epidemiology, Institute of Health Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; Consortium for Biomedical Research in Epidemiology & Public Health (CIBER en Epidemiologia y Salud Publica - CIBERESP), Spain.', 'Geochemistry Unit, Geological and Mining Institute of Spain, Madrid, Spain.', 'Geochemistry Unit, Geological and Mining Institute of Spain, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cancer & Environmental Epidemiology Unit, National Centre for Epidemiology, Institute of Health Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; Consortium for Biomedical Research in Epidemiology & Public Health (CIBER en Epidemiologia y Salud Publica - CIBERESP), Spain.', 'Research Unit of Social Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Cancer & Environmental Epidemiology Unit, National Centre for Epidemiology, Institute of Health Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; Consortium for Biomedical Research in Epidemiology & Public Health (CIBER en Epidemiologia y Salud Publica - CIBERESP), Spain.', 'Department of Chronic Diseases, National Centre for Epidemiology, Institute of Health Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Autonomous University of Madrid/IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain.

Nurses should be provided with information regarding early detection, coping skills and treatment for anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSS)/post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other mental health disorders. Early intervention is important as mental health disorders can cause dysfunction, internal suffering, and in the most extreme situations, lead to death if not properly cared for. Healthcare corporations should consider providing coverage for mental health treatment for employees who experience COVID-19 traumas. With the implementation of healthy coping skills and therapeutic intervention, nurses will be able to let go of the negative impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and reintegrate into their roles as caring and entrusted health care providers.

Over the same period, the CAF strengthened its mental health system. This article explores the effect of these events on the prevalence of past-year mental disorders over the period 2002-2013. METHOD: The data sources were 2 highly comparable population-based mental health surveys of CAF Regular Force personnel done in 2002 and 2013 (n = 5155 and 6996, respectively). Data were collected via in-person interviews with Statistics Canada personnel using the World Health Organization's Composite International Diagnostic Interview to assess past-year disorders. RESULTS: In 2013, 16.5% had 1 or more of the 6 past-year disorders assessed in the survey, with the most common conditions being major depressive episode (MDE), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which affected 8.0%, 5.3%, and 4.7%, respectively. The prevalence of PTSD, GAD, and panic disorder has increased significantly since 2002 (adjusted odds ratios from logistic regression models = 2.1, 3.0, and 1.9, respectively), while no change was seen for MDE. The comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders increased significantly over time, being seen in 27.4% and 41.0% of those with mental disorders in 2002 and 2013, respectively. CONCLUSION: There has been an increase in the prevalence of PTSD and other anxiety disorders and of the extent of comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders in CAF personnel over the period 2002-2013.","['Zamorski, Mark A', 'Bennett, Rachel E', 'Rusu, Corneliu', 'Weeks, Murray', 'Boulos, David', 'Garber, Bryan G']","['Zamorski MA', 'Bennett RE', 'Rusu C', 'Weeks M', 'Boulos D', 'Garber BG']","['Directorate of Mental Health, Canadian Forces Health Services Group Headquarters, Ottawa, Ontario Department of Family Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario mark.zamorski@forces.gc.ca.', 'Directorate of Mental Health, Canadian Forces Health Services Group Headquarters, Ottawa, Ontario.', 'Directorate of Mental Health, Canadian Forces Health Services Group Headquarters, Ottawa, Ontario.', 'Directorate of Mental Health, Canadian Forces Health Services Group Headquarters, Ottawa, Ontario.', 'Directorate of Mental Health, Canadian Forces Health Services Group Headquarters, Ottawa, Ontario.', 'Directorate of Mental Health, Canadian Forces Health Services Group Headquarters, Ottawa, Ontario.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Can J Psychiatry,Canadian journal of psychiatry.

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study utilizing a Web-based survey of pediatric residency PDs to assess program characteristics, learning modalities PDs currently had or would implement, and their knowledge of the new American Academy of Pediatrics' MH competencies. PDs then ranked their residents' knowledge and skills for 29 MH competencies. Analyses included descriptive statistics and bivariate and multivariate analyses to assess for associations between variables, particularly MH model of care and perceived competence. RESULTS: Ninety-nine PDs (51%) responded. A total of 87% of PDs reported that MH care was taught as part of another rotation, yet PDs were receptive to curricular changes. Only 45% of PDs were aware of the 2009 American Academy of Pediatrics competencies, and PDs infrequently rated their residents' MH skills and knowledge to be above average. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was an exception: 64% reported above-average ADHD knowledge in diagnoses and 57% in treatment. There was an association between enhanced MH services in continuity clinics and perceived resident systems-based practice (P < .01) and medical knowledge (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: PDs acknowledged that MH training is not emphasized, leading to deficiencies in their residents' knowledge and skills in MH care. The receptivity of PDs suggests the need for targeted dissemination of national guidelines or curriculum. Integrated models of care may be one way to improve resident competencies, but this deserves further study.","['Green, Cori', 'Hampton, Elisa', 'Ward, Mary J', 'Shao, Huibo', 'Bostwick, Susan']","['Green C', 'Hampton E', 'Ward MJ', 'Shao H', 'Bostwick S']","['Department of Pediatrics, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.

The network stability, structure and (bridge) centrality of the nodes were assessed for the total group and each ED type. Network differences between the ED types were also examined. RESULTS: ED psychopathology was only weakly connected with the well-being domains. Psychological well-being was the most central node in the domain network. The most central nodes in the symptom network were feeling depressed, feeling worthless, purpose in life and self-acceptance. Bridge symptoms between well-being and psychopathology were self-acceptance, environmental mastery, interested in life and feeling depressed. There were no network differences between the ED types in both the domain and symptom networks. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows novel associations between well-being and psychopathology in ED patients. Central domains and their underlying symptoms may be especially important to consider in treatment for promoting mental health in ED patients.","['de Vos, Jan Alexander', 'Radstaak, Mirjam', 'Bohlmeijer, Ernst T', 'Westerhof, Gerben J']","['de Vos JA', 'Radstaak M', 'Bohlmeijer ET', 'Westerhof GJ']","['Department of Psychology, Health and Technology, Centre for eHealth and Wellbeing Research, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands.', 'Stichting Human Concern, Centrum voor eetstoornissen, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Psychology, Health and Technology, Centre for eHealth and Wellbeing Research, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Psychology, Health and Technology, Centre for eHealth and Wellbeing Research, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Psychology, Health and Technology, Centre for eHealth and Wellbeing Research, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210505,England,Eur Eat Disord Rev,European eating disorders review : the journal of the Eating Disorders Association,9436977,IM,"['*Anorexia Nervosa/psychology', '*Bulimia Nervosa/psychology', '*Feeding and Eating Disorders', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Psychometrics']",PMC8252750,,['NOTNLM'],"['eating disorders', 'network analysis', 'positive functioning', 'positive mental health', 'psychological well-being', 'well-being']",2021/05/06 06:00,2022/03/29 06:00,['2021/05/05 09:17'],"['2021/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/03/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/05 09:17 [entrez]']","['ERV2832 [pii]', '10.1002/erv.2832 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Eat Disord Rev. 2021 Jul;29(4):559-574. doi: 10.1002/erv.2832.

However, barriers exist in the provision of these services and access is limited. Therefore, researchers are beginning to develop and deliver interventions online and via mobile phones. Previous research has indicated that interventions delivered in this format are acceptable for people with SMI. However, a comprehensive systematic review is needed to investigate the acceptability of online and mobile phone-delivered interventions for SMI in depth. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to 1) identify the hypothetical acceptability (acceptability prior to or without the delivery of an intervention) and actual acceptability (acceptability where an intervention was delivered) of online and mobile phone-delivered interventions for SMI, 2) investigate the impact of factors such as demographic and clinical characteristics on acceptability, and 3) identify common participant views in qualitative studies that pinpoint factors influencing acceptability. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the databases PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science in April 2015, which yielded a total of 8017 search results, with 49 studies meeting the full inclusion criteria. Studies were included if they measured acceptability through participant views, module completion rates, or intervention use. Studies delivering interventions were included if the delivery method was online or via mobile phones. RESULTS: The hypothetical acceptability of online and mobile phone-delivered interventions for SMI was relatively low, while actual acceptability tended to be high. Hypothetical acceptability was higher for interventions delivered via text messages than by emails. The majority of studies that assessed the impact of demographic characteristics on acceptability reported no significant relationships between the two. Additionally, actual acceptability was higher when participants were provided remote online support. Common qualitative factors relating to acceptability were safety and privacy concerns, the importance of an engaging and appealing delivery format, the inclusion of peer support, computer and mobile phone literacy, technical issues, and concerns about the impact of psychological state on intervention use. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides an in-depth focus on the acceptability of online and mobile phone-delivered interventions for SMI and identified the need for further research in this area. Based on the results from this review, we recommend that researchers measure both hypothetical and actual acceptability to identify whether initial perceptions of online and mobile phone-delivered interventions change after access. In addition, more focus is needed on the potential impact of demographic and clinical characteristics on acceptability. The review also identified issues with module completion rates and intervention use as measures of acceptability. We therefore advise researchers to obtain qualitative reports of acceptability throughout each phase of intervention development and testing. Further implications and opportunities for future research are discussed.","['Berry, Natalie', 'Lobban, Fiona', 'Emsley, Richard', 'Bucci, Sandra']","['Berry N', 'Lobban F', 'Emsley R', 'Bucci S']","['Health eResearch Centre (HeRC), Institute of Population Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom. natalie.berry@manchester.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['HS&DR/14/04/16/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'MR/L005301/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'PB-PG-0807-14075/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'MR/K006665/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20160531,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Phone/*statistics & numerical data', 'Counseling', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*therapy', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Telemedicine/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC4908305,,['NOTNLM'],"['acceptability', 'bipolar disorder', 'eHealth', 'mHealth', 'personality disorder', 'psychosis', 'severe mental health', 'severe mental health problems (SMI)']",2016/06/02 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2015/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['v18i5e121 [pii]', '10.2196/jmir.5250 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2016 May 31;18(5):e121. doi: 10.2196/jmir.5250.,5,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7414-1541', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6594-4350', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1218-675X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6197-5333']",,"['Conflicts of Interest: SB and RE are investigators for a mobile-delivered', 'intervention for early psychosis (Actissist).

Specifically, this study tested whether higher levels of experienced discrimination would be longitudinally associated with lower levels of symptomatic remission, functional restoration, well-being, and life satisfaction and whether these associations would be mediated by higher levels of self-stigma content and process. A total of 202 people with mental disorders completed questionnaires at three time points (i.e., T1, T2, and T3) over two years. Path analyses showed that experienced discrimination at T1 was positively associated with self-stigma content and process at T2, which were, in turn, negatively associated with symptomatic remission, functional restoration, well-being, and life satisfaction at T3. Bootstrap analyses further revealed that experienced discrimination at T1 had indirect effects on symptomatic remission, functional restoration, well-being, and life satisfaction at T3 through self-stigma content and process at T2. This study shows that experienced discrimination may exacerbate self-stigma content and process and, in turn, impede recovery and wellness among people with mental disorders. Our findings highlight the importance of designing and implementing stigma and self-stigma reduction programs in order to enable people with mental disorders to attain mental illness recovery and positive mental health.","['Chan, Kevin Ka Shing', 'Tsui, Jack Ka Chun']","['Chan KKS', 'Tsui JKC']","['Department of Psychology, The Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Centre for Psychosocial Health, The Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.

However, little is known about the MH comorbidities of HS. OBJECTIVES: To determine the MH disorders and cost burden associated with HS. METHODS: Data were examined from the 2002-2012 National Inpatient Sample, comprising approximately a 20% sample of all U.S. paediatric and adult hospitalizations (87 053 155 admissions). RESULTS: MH disorders were much more common in inpatients with vs. without HS (34.27% vs. 20.05%). In multivariable logistic regression models controlling for sex, age, race/ethnicity and insurance status, HS was associated with significantly higher odds of an MH disorder (adjusted odds ratio 2.53, 95% confidence interval 2.42-2.63), including 10 of 15 MH disorders examined. In contrast, HS was not associated with primary hospitalization for an MH disorder overall (odds ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.84-1.07), but it was associated with primary hospitalization for eight of 15 MH disorders examined. Among inpatients with HS, primary admission for an MH disorder was associated with female sex, public or no insurance and more chronic diseases, but inversely associated with older age and nonwhite race/ethnicity. HS was associated with > $38 million (USD) of excess mean annual costs of hospitalization for MH disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Inpatients with HS had increased odds of comorbid MH disorders, overall, and multiple primary MH admissions, in particular, which were associated with considerable excess costs.","['Patel, K R', 'Rastogi, S', 'Singam, V', 'Lee, H H', 'Amin, A Z', 'Silverberg, J I']","['Patel KR', 'Rastogi S', 'Singam V', 'Lee HH', 'Amin AZ', 'Silverberg JI']","['Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, 60611, U.S.A.', 'Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, 60611, U.S.A.', 'Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, 60611, U.S.A.', 'Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, 60611, U.S.A.', 'Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, 60611, U.S.A.', 'Department of Dermatology, Preventive Medicine and Medical Social Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, 60611, U.S.A.', 'Northwestern Medicine Multidisciplinary Eczema Center, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.']",['eng'],['K12 HS023011/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20190226,England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa/economics/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Hospitalization/economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/economics/*epidemiology/psychology/therapy', 'Mental Health/economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2018/11/14 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2018/11/14 06:00'],"['2018/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjd.17416 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2019 Aug;181(2):275-281. doi: 10.1111/bjd.17416.

High unemployment is conceptualized as a stressor having serious effects on individuals' mental health. Data from surveys administered repeatedly over 15 years (1997-2011) described changes over time in the prevalence of chronic mental illness among US adults. The data allowed us to pinpoint changes characterizing the White majority--but not Black, Hispanic, or Asian minorities--and to ask whether such changes were attributable to economic conditions (measured via national unemployment rates). METHODS: We combined 1.5 decades' worth of National Health Interview Survey data in one secondary analysis. We took social structural and demographic factors into account and let adjusted probability of chronic mental illness indicate prevalence of chronic mental illness RESULTS: We observed, as a general trend, that chronic mental illness probability increased as the unemployment rate rose. A greater increase in probability was observed for Blacks than Whites, notably during 2007-2011, the heart of the recession CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed that structural risk posed by the recent recession and by vulnerability to the recession's effects was differentially linked to Blacks. This led to the group's high probability of chronic mental illness, observed even when individual-level social structural and demographic factors were controlled. Future research should specify the particular kinds of vulnerability that created the additional disadvantage experienced by Black respondents.","['Lo, Celia C', 'Cheng, Tyrone C']","['Lo CC', 'Cheng TC']","['School of Social Work, University of Alabama, Box 870314, Tuscaloosa, AL, 35487-0314, USA, clo@ua.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140221,Germany,Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,8804358,IM,"['Adult', 'Chronic Disease/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Demography', 'Economic Recession', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/*ethnology', 'Mental Health/ethnology/statistics & numerical data', 'Minority Groups/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', 'Racial Groups/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Unemployment/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology/ethnology']",,,,,2014/02/22 06:00,2014/11/02 06:00,['2014/02/22 06:00'],"['2013/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00127-014-0844-x [doi]'],ppublish,Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol. 2014 Jul;49(7):1119-28. doi: 10.1007/s00127-014-0844-x.

Less is known about the impact on mental health of their relatives, and potential interventions to support them. METHODS: Systematic review and narrative synthesis. OUTCOMES: 28 studies were identified, sixteen quantitative and twelve qualitative. One involved health workers' relatives, and the rest covered relatives of directly affected individuals. We found considerable burden of mental ill-health in both groups. Among relatives of healthcare workers, 29.4% reported symptoms consistent with probable anxiety disorder and 33.7% with probable depression. Prevalence rates for probable anxiety disorder ranged from 24-42% and probable depression 17-51% for the relatives of affected people. One study found a 2% prevalence of PTSD and another found odds of PTSS were significantly higher among relatives of affected individuals compared with the general population. Only two intervention studies were identified and both were descriptive in nature. INTERPRETATION: Available evidence suggests relatives of people affected by infective outbreaks report mental ill-health. Having a relative who died particularly increased risk. Good outcomes for relatives of affected individuals were promoted by practical and social support, public health guidance that recognises the caring role of relatives, and being supported to see the positives as well as negatives in their situation. Good outcomes for relatives of health workers were promoted by perceived effectiveness of protective equipment. High quality evidence on potential interventions to support relatives is lacking. FUNDING: No external funding sought.","['Gentry, Sarah V', 'Thomas-Meyer, Molly', 'Tyrrell, Carina S B', 'Mavrodaris, Angelique', 'Williams, Richard', 'Wallbank, Sonya', 'Chitsabesan, Prathiba', 'Greenberg, Neil', 'Ahmed, Aliko', 'Abdul Pari, Anees Ahmed']","['Gentry SV', 'Thomas-Meyer M', 'Tyrrell CSB', 'Mavrodaris A', 'Williams R', 'Wallbank S', 'Chitsabesan P', 'Greenberg N', 'Ahmed A', 'Abdul Pari AA']","['Public Health England, East of England, UK; Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, UK.', 'Public Health England, East of England, UK.', 'Public Health England, East of England, UK; MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, UK.', 'Public Health England, East of England, UK.', 'University of South Wales, UK.', 'NHS England, UK.', 'Manchester Metropolitan University, UK.', ""King's College London, UK."", 'Public Health England, East of England, UK.', 'Public Health England, East of England, UK; NHS England, UK.

Anxiety and depressive disorders are the most common followed by substance use disorder. Many people who suffer from a mental illness do not seek help. Studies have shown that the stigma of being perceived as having a mental illness prevents many adults from seeking help. Mental Health First Aid  (MHFA) is an educational program geared towards educating MHFA responders to assist those who may be experiencing a mental health condition or disorder. Pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare professionals, and many are trained in delivering MHFA. The literature on MHFA suggests that it is an effective educational program for those that take the training course. What is lacking is evidence that MHFA interventions positively affect help-seeking behaviours after an intervention has occurred between a mental health first air responder and an individual requiring MHFA. This paper highlights this issue and provides suggestions for future research.","['Chowdhary, Azmeta', 'Zlotnikova, Victoria', 'Lucas, Cherie', 'Lonie, John M']","['Chowdhary A', 'Zlotnikova V', 'Lucas C', 'Lonie JM']","['Long Island University, College of Pharmacy, 75 Dekalb Avenue, Brooklyn, NY, 11201, USA.', 'Long Island University, College of Pharmacy, 75 Dekalb Avenue, Brooklyn, NY, 11201, USA.', 'University of Technology, Graduate School of Health (Pharmacy Discipline), 67 Thomas Street, Ultimo, Sydney, Australia.', 'Long Island University, College of Pharmacy, 75 Dekalb Avenue, Brooklyn, NY, 11201, USA.

The present review examines the recent evidence of the possible association between economic recessions and mental health outcomes. METHODS: Literature review of records identified through Medline, PsycINFO, SciELO, and EBSCO Host. Only original research papers, published between 2004 and 2014, peer-reviewed, non-qualitative research, and reporting on associations between economic factors and proxies of mental health were considered. RESULTS: One-hundred-one papers met the inclusion criteria. The evidence was consistent that economic recessions and mediators such as unemployment, income decline, and unmanageable debts are significantly associated with poor mental wellbeing, increased rates of common mental disorders, substance-related disorders, and suicidal behaviours. CONCLUSION: On the basis of a thorough analysis of the selected investigations, we conclude that periods of economic recession are possibly associated with a higher prevalence of mental health problems, including common mental disorders, substance disorders, and ultimately suicidal behaviour. Most of the research is based on cross-sectional studies, which seriously limits causality inferences. Conclusions are summarised, taking into account international policy recommendations concerning the cost-effective measures that can possibly reduce the occurrence of negative mental health outcomes in populations during periods of economic recession.","['Frasquilho, Diana', 'Matos, Margarida Gaspar', 'Salonna, Ferdinand', 'Guerreiro, Diogo', 'Storti, Claudia C', 'Gaspar, Tania', 'Caldas-de-Almeida, Jose M']","['Frasquilho D', 'Matos MG', 'Salonna F', 'Guerreiro D', 'Storti CC', 'Gaspar T', 'Caldas-de-Almeida JM']","['Medical School, CMDT, Nova University Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Faculty of Human Kinetics, ISAMB, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Institute of Active Lifestyle, Faculty of Physical Culture, Palacky University Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic. ferdinand.salonna@upol.cz.', 'Psychiatry Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Aventura Social/ISAMB, University of Lisbon and Lisbon Lusiada University, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Department of Mental Health, Medical School, Nova University Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20160203,England,BMC Public Health,BMC public health,100968562,IM,"['Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Economic Recession/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Income', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Suicide', 'Unemployment/psychology']",PMC4741013,,,,2016/02/06 06:00,2016/09/01 06:00,['2016/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12889-016-2720-y [pii]', '2720 [pii]', '10.1186/s12889-016-2720-y [doi]']",epublish,BMC Public Health. 2016 Feb 3;16:115. doi: 10.1186/s12889-016-2720-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crisis intervention teams (CITs), already used in the USA, are now attracting wider interest, including in the UK. Investment in these interventions is growing, so it is important to have evidence of their effectiveness. AIM: To conduct a systematic literature review to answer questions about effectiveness of police-mental health service models for responding to people with mental disorder and suspected offending or public safety problems. METHODS: A population/participant, intervention/indicator, comparator/control, outcome (PICO) framework was developed and keywords used to locate research studies within 29 databases. The 3179 results returned were screened by two researchers against preset inclusion and exclusion criteria. This resulted in 23 studies being included from which were taken the study methodology and findings and on which a narrative synthesis was conducted. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies could be included, overall showing a positive impact of the interventions considered, but no well-designed randomised controlled trials to test this optimistic view rigorously. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, rather than indicating that one approach is more effective than another, the review points to the need for a multi-faceted approach within a structured and integrated model, such as the CIT model. This is generally not the current pattern of interventions, and policy makers, service commissioners and providers may wish to review future options.

Using data from 868 Latinos of Mexican origin, we further investigated the extent to which religious attendance mediated the direct path between generation status and lifetime prevalence rates of any substance use disorder, depressive disorder, and anxiety disorder. Results indicate that Mexican immigrants endorsed lower lifetime prevalence rates of depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder and endorsed higher levels of religious attendance. Second, results indicate a significant negative relationship between religious attendance and prevalence rates for depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder. Third, results indicate that religious attendance was a mediator for the relationship between generation status and the lifetime prevalence rates of substance use disorder only. These results provide a contribution toward the discussion of the immigrant health paradox and further highlight the role that religious attendance plays in the relationship between generational status and the lifetime prevalence rates of substance use disorder.

Focused on Palestinians, this paper discusses the collective trauma Palestinians experienced and how it manifests in transgenerational effects on the body and mind that may be post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or perhaps another distinct condition that is yet to be codified in the Western medical lexicon. It describes local alternatives to Western medical diagnostic tools like the ""ease to disease"" diagnostic scale and the sociopolitical context-in this case, the Palestinian fight for karamah, or dignity-from which such alternatives arise. Based on these findings, a novel theoretical framework, the comprehensive communal trauma intervention model (CCTIM), a truly transdisciplinary population-level model for treating mental health in vulnerable communities globally, is proposed. It articulates the need to address the root cause of collective trauma, make modifications to the healthcare system, and cultivate strategic equity-oriented and research-based partnerships.","['Yudkin, Joshua S', 'Bakshi, Parul', 'Craker, Kelsey', 'Taha, Sari']","['Yudkin JS', 'Bakshi P', 'Craker K', 'Taha S']","['Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetics and Environmental Sciences, University of Texas Health Sciences Center At Houston School of Public Health, 6011 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX, 75235, USA.

29731158,NLM,MEDLINE,20190318,20220331,2468-2667 (Electronic),3,2018 May,The effect of post-traumatic stress disorder on refugees' parenting and their children's mental health: a cohort study.,e249-e258,S2468-2667(18)30051-3 [pii] 10.1016/S2468-2667(18)30051-3 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents, who account for most of the world's refugees, have an increased prevalence of psychological disorders. The mental health of refugee children is often associated with the severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in their caregivers. Despite the potential for refugee caregivers' PTSD to affect child mental health, little evidence exists concerning the underlying mechanisms of this association. This study tested the effect of refugee caregivers' previous trauma and levels of ongoing stressors on current PTSD, and in turn how this influences parenting behaviour and consequent child psychological health. METHODS: This cohort study recruited participants from the Building a New Life in Australia study, a population-based prospective cohort study of refugees admitted to 11 sites in Australia between October, 2013, and February, 2014. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older and the principal or secondary applicant (ie, the refugee applicant within a migrating family unit) for a humanitarian visa awarded between May, 2013, and December, 2013. Primary caregiver PTSD and postmigration difficulties were assessed at Wave 1 (in 2013), and caregiver PTSD was reassessed at Wave 2 (in 2014). At Wave 3, between October, 2015, and February, 2016, primary caregivers repeated measures of trauma history, postmigration difficulties, probable PTSD, and harsh and warm parenting style, and completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for their child. We used path analysis to investigate temporal patterns in PTSD, trauma history, postmigration stressors, parenting style, and children's psychological difficulties. FINDINGS: The current data comprised 411 primary caregivers who provided responses in relation to at least one child (660 children). 394 primary caregivers with 639 children had data on independent variables and were included in the final model. Path analyses revealed that caregivers' trauma history and postmigration difficulties were associated with greater subsequent PTSD, which in turn was associated with greater harsh parenting and in turn, higher levels of child conduct problems (beta=0.049, p=0.0214), hyperactivity (beta=0.044, p=0.0241), emotional symptoms (beta=0.041, p=0.0218), and peer problems (beta=0.007, p=0.047). There was also a direct path from primary caregiver PTSD to children's emotional problems (beta=0.144, p=0.0001). INTERPRETATION: PTSD in refugees is associated with harsh parenting styles, leading to adverse effects on their children's mental health. Programmes to enhance refugee children's mental health should account for PTSD in parents and caregivers, and the parenting behaviours that these children are exposed to.

Recent studies have identified mental health problems among the survivors, but little is known about the impact of the Sichuan earthquake on the mental health of pregnant women in the area. The main objective was to assess the impact of the Sichuan earthquake on the mental health of pregnant women in earthquake stricken areas. METHODS: During November 2009 and January 2010, 311 pregnant women were interviewed. Symptoms of PTSD were measured using IES-R, while symptoms of antenatal depression were measured using EPDS. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of PTSD symptoms was 12.2% (95% CI, 9.0-16.4). The rate of major depression was 40.8% (95% CI, 35.5-46.4). Living through an earthquake has been significantly correlated with PTSD but no significant correlation has been found with depression. The perceived stresses of pregnancy are significantly correlated with both depression and PTSD. LIMITATIONS: Lack of long term follow up data and comparison group from non earthquake struck area. CONCLUSIONS: 18 months after the Sichuan earthquake, the incidence of depression and PTSD were still quite high among pregnant women in the earthquake stricken areas. Depression was more common than PTSD. Living through an earthquake has been significantly correlated with PTSD but not with depression.","['Qu, Zhiyong', 'Tian, Donghua', 'Zhang, Qin', 'Wang, Xiaohua', 'He, Huan', 'Zhang, Xiulan', 'Huang, Lili', 'Xu, Fan']","['Qu Z', 'Tian D', 'Zhang Q', 'Wang X', 'He H', 'Zhang X', 'Huang L', 'Xu F']","['School of Social Development and Public Policy, China Institute of Health, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.', 'School of Social Development and Public Policy, China Institute of Health, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.', ""MianZhu People's Hosiptal, Mianzhu, China."", 'School of Social Development and Public Policy, China Institute of Health, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.', 'School of Social Development and Public Policy, China Institute of Health, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.', 'School of Social Development and Public Policy, China Institute of Health, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.

Target areas for mental health literacy programs should be guided by research that tests the impact of improving knowledge of psychological constructs associated with the development of mental health problems. AIMS: This study investigated the impact of providing corrective information about the nature of intrusive thoughts on their subsequent appraisal in a community sample. METHOD: In an online, experimental design, 148 community participants completed measures of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and appraisals (Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised [OCI-R]; Intrusions Inventory [III]). Individuals were instructed to read either a brief informational text about the nature of intrusive thoughts or a control text. All participants then completed post-test measurements of appraisals. Intervention effectiveness was analysed using hierarchical multiple regression. RESULTS: Individuals in the intervention group reported significantly lower levels of maladaptive appraisals than those in the control group (alpha = .05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the efficacy of provision of brief written information in reducing negative appraisals of intrusive thoughts in a community sample. It suggests a possible role for education about intrusive thoughts as a prevention strategy for obsessive-compulsive disorder.","['Rees, Clare S', 'Austen, Tomas', 'Anderson, Rebecca A', 'Egan, Sarah J']","['Rees CS', 'Austen T', 'Anderson RA', 'Egan SJ']","['Curtin University,Perth,Australia.', 'Curtin University,Perth,Australia.', 'Curtin University,Perth,Australia.', 'Curtin University,Perth,Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20131126,United States,Behav Cogn Psychother,Behavioural and cognitive psychotherapy,9418292,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Attitude to Health', '*Cognitive Behavioral Therapy', 'Controlled Before-After Studies', 'Female', '*Health Literacy', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*psychology', 'Mental Health/*education', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/diagnosis/psychology', '*Reinforcement, Verbal', '*Thinking', 'Western Australia', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2013/11/28 06:00,2015/01/21 06:00,['2013/11/28 06:00'],"['2013/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S1352465813000994 [pii]', '10.1017/S1352465813000994 [doi]']",ppublish,Behav Cogn Psychother. 2014 Jul;42(4):502-7. doi: 10.1017/S1352465813000994.

About half of those patients are diagnosed in primary care. Objective: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to improve the screening and diagnosing of anxiety and/or depression among adult patients at a primary care clinic by implementing an evidence-based mental health screening interview technique. Methods: The team implemented a mental health screening interview technique that incorporates background, affect, trouble, handling, and empathy and motivational interviewing techniques in addition to self-report surveys. Pre- and post-intervention surveys were conducted to assess providers' perceptions of the new interview technique. ICD-10 code data were gathered to assess the effectiveness of the new mental health screening interview technique. Results: The number of documented diagnoses of single-episode major depressive disorder decreased by 18%, recurrent major depressive disorder increased by 34%, and anxiety disorders increased by 3%. There were more favorable provider perceptions of the new screening interview technique versus the traditional screening method. Conclusions: The results show an improvement in provider comfort and providers preferred the new mental health screening when using an evidence-based mental health screening interview technique. Implications for nursing: The results show the potential benefits of using a structured mental health interview with self-report screening tools when diagnosing anxiety and depression in primary care.","[""D'Amico, Lauren N"", 'Hanania, Hannah', 'Lee, Loretta T']","[""D'Amico LN"", 'Hanania H', 'Lee LT']","['University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Nursing, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Nursing, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Nursing, Birmingham, AL, USA llee@uab.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Dr Nurs Pract,Journal of doctoral nursing practice,101685366,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', '*Mental Health', '*Depressive Disorder, Major', 'Quality Improvement', 'Anxiety Disorders/diagnosis', 'Primary Health Care']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['interview screening', 'mental health', 'primary care', 'quality improvement']",2023/12/05 00:41,2023/12/06 06:42,['2023/12/04 20:42'],"['2023/12/06 06:42 [medline]', '2023/12/05 00:41 [pubmed]', '2023/12/04 20:42 [entrez]']","['16/3/196 [pii]', '10.1891/JDNP-2022-0042 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dr Nurs Pract. 2023 Dec 1;16(3):196-204. doi: 10.1891/JDNP-2022-0042.,3,,,,"['(c) Copyright 2023 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent national statistics describing acute care hospitalizations for mental health conditions are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To describe national trends in pediatric mental health hospitalizations between 2009 and 2019, to compare utilization among mental health and non-mental health hospitalizations, and to characterize variation in utilization across hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis of the 2009, 2012, 2016, and 2019 Kids' Inpatient Database, a nationally representative database of US acute care hospital discharges. Analysis included 4 767 840 weighted hospitalizations among children 3 to 17 years of age. EXPOSURES: Hospitalizations with primary mental health diagnoses were identified using the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Disorders Classification System, which classified mental health diagnoses into 30 mutually exclusive disorder types. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Measures included number and proportion of hospitalizations with a primary mental health diagnosis and with attempted suicide, suicidal ideation, or self-injury; number and proportion of hospital days and interfacility transfers attributable to mental health hospitalizations; mean lengths of stay (days) and transfer rates among mental health and non-mental health hospitalizations; and variation in these measures across hospitals. RESULTS: Of 201 932 pediatric mental health hospitalizations in 2019, 123 342 (61.1% [95% CI, 60.3%-61.9%]) were in females, 100 038 (49.5% [95% CI, 48.3%-50.7%]) were in adolescents aged 15 to 17 years, and 103 456 (51.3% [95% CI, 48.6%-53.9%]) were covered by Medicaid. Between 2009 and 2019, the number of pediatric mental health hospitalizations increased by 25.8%, and these hospitalizations accounted for a significantly higher proportion of pediatric hospitalizations (11.5% [95% CI, 10.2%-12.8%] vs 19.8% [95% CI, 17.7%-21.9%]), hospital days (22.2% [95% CI, 19.1%-25.3%] vs 28.7% [95% CI, 24.4%-33.0%]), and interfacility transfers (36.9% [95% CI, 33.2%-40.5%] vs 49.3% [95% CI, 45.9%-52.7%]). The percentage of mental health hospitalizations with attempted suicide, suicidal ideation, or self-injury diagnoses increased significantly from 30.7% (95% CI, 28.6%-32.8%) in 2009 to 64.2% (95% CI, 62.3%-66.2%) in 2019. Length of stay and interfacility transfer rates varied significantly across hospitals. Across all years, mental health hospitalizations had significantly longer mean lengths of stay and higher transfer rates compared with non-mental health hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Between 2009 and 2019, the number and proportion of pediatric acute care hospitalizations due to mental health diagnoses increased significantly. The majority of mental health hospitalizations in 2019 included a diagnosis of attempted suicide, suicidal ideation, or self-injury, underscoring the increasing importance of this concern.","['Arakelyan, Mary', 'Freyleue, Seneca', 'Avula, Divya', 'McLaren, Jennifer L', ""O'Malley, A James"", 'Leyenaar, JoAnna K']","['Arakelyan M', 'Freyleue S', 'Avula D', 'McLaren JL', ""O'Malley AJ"", 'Leyenaar JK']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Dartmouth Health Children's, Lebanon, New Hampshire."", 'The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy & Clinical Practice, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire.', 'The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy & Clinical Practice, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire.', 'University of Louisville School of Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Dartmouth Health Children's, Lebanon, New Hampshire."", 'The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy & Clinical Practice, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Dartmouth Health, Lebanon, New Hampshire.', 'The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy & Clinical Practice, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire.', 'Department of Biomedical Data Science, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Dartmouth Health Children's, Lebanon, New Hampshire."", 'The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy & Clinical Practice, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data/trends', '*Hospitals/statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Hospitals, Pediatric/statistics & numerical data/trends', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology/therapy', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Suicide/statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Male', 'Medicaid/statistics & numerical data/trends']",PMC10051095,,,,2023/03/29 06:00,2023/03/30 06:11,['2023/03/28 11:03'],"['2023/03/30 06:11 [medline]', '2023/03/28 11:03 [entrez]', '2023/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]']","['2802915 [pii]', 'joi230020 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.2023.1992 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2023 Mar 28;329(12):1000-1011. doi: 10.1001/jama.2023.1992.,12,,"['JAMA. 2023 Aug 1;330(5):473-474.

Differences in preparation and military engagement experiences between active component and reserve component forces have long suggested that the psychiatric consequences of military engagement differ by component. We conducted a systematic review of prevalence and new onset of psychiatric disorders among reserve component forces and a meta-analysis of prevalence estimates comparing reserve component and active component forces, and we documented stage-sequential drivers of psychiatric burden among reserve component forces. We identified 27 reports from 19 unique samples published between 1985 and 2012: 9 studies reporting on the reserve component alone and 10 reporting on both the reserve component and the active component. The pooled prevalence for alcohol use disorders of 14.5% (95% confidence interval: 12.7, 15.2) among the reserve component was higher than that of 11.7% (95% confidence interval: 10.9, 12.6) among the active component, while there were no component differences for depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. We observed substantial heterogeneity in prevalence estimates reported by the reserve component. Published studies suggest that stage-sequential risk factors throughout the deployment cycle predicted alcohol use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and, to a lesser degree, depression. Improved and more standardized documentation of the mental health burden, as well as study of explanatory factors within a life-course framework, is necessary to inform mitigating strategies and to reduce psychiatric burden among reserve component forces.","['Cohen, Gregory H', 'Fink, David S', 'Sampson, Laura', 'Galea, Sandro']","['Cohen GH', 'Fink DS', 'Sampson L', 'Galea S']",,['eng'],"['R01 MH082729/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DA031099/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', '1R01-MH082729/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'T32DA031099/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20150116,United States,Epidemiol Rev,Epidemiologic reviews,7910703,IM,"['Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Military Personnel/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Models, Statistical', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Veterans/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Veterans Health/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC4325668,,['NOTNLM'],"['alcoholism', 'depression', 'mental health', 'military medicine', 'stress disorders, post-traumatic', ""veterans' health""]",2015/01/18 06:00,2015/11/10 06:00,['2015/01/18 06:00'],"['2015/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['mxu007 [pii]', '10.1093/epirev/mxu007 [doi]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Rev. 2015;37(1):7-22. doi: 10.1093/epirev/mxu007.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: During the preparation of the article, the following was processed: scientific research on ensuring the rights of persons suffering from mental disorders in criminal proceedings; provisions of international agreements on the provision of psychiatric care; the legal position of the ECHR on the observance of the right to a fair trial of persons suffering from mental disorders (6 decisions were analyzed in which the ECHR addressed these issues in the context of the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention); criminal procedural legislation of individual states; the results of a survey conducted by the authors of 88 judges (judges of local courts of Ukraine) on key issues of ensuring the participation of a person suffering from a mental disorder in a court hearing. In the process of research a set of general scientific and special methods of cognition was used (comparative-legal method, systemic-structural method, generalization method, method of analysis and synthesis, method of sociological research, method of expert assessments, etc.). RESULTS: Results: According to the results of the research: a) the legal positions of the ECHR to ensure the right of a person suffering from a mental disorder to a fair trial are identified and generalized (Article 6 of the Convention); b) criteria for the legality of restricting the right of a person suffering from a mental disorder to personal participation in the trial are proposed. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: An analysis of the ECHR's key positions led to the conclusion that there was a violation of a person's right to a fair trial in national case law (Article 6 of theConvention), due in part to the lack of clear criteria for legally restricting a person's right to a trial.","['Tatsiy, Vasyl Y', 'Tyshchenko, Olga I', 'Titko, Ivan A']","['Tatsiy VY', 'Tyshchenko OI', 'Titko IA']","['Yaroslav Mudryi National Law University, Kharkiv, Ukraine.', 'Yaroslav Mudryi National Law University, Kharkiv, Ukraine.', 'Poltava Law Institute of Yaroslav Mudryi National Law University, Poltava, Ukraine.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Poland,Wiad Lek,"Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)",9705467,IM,"['*Criminals', 'Human Rights', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Psychotic Disorders', 'Ukraine']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['ECHR practice', 'expert opinion', 'mental disorder', 'mental health', 'right to a fair trial']",2021/02/22 06:00,2021/02/24 06:00,['2021/02/21 20:39'],"['2021/02/21 20:39 [entrez]', '2021/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Wiad Lek. 2020;73(12 cz 2):2737-2742.,12 cz 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is limited knowledge about when this pattern emerged or whether it has been a historically fixed feature. The objective of this study was to assess whether socioeconomic and gender gaps in mental health changed during the period 1900-1959 in Sweden. We used historical micro data which report all necessary information on individuals' demographic characteristics, occupational attainment and mental disorders (N = 2,450) in a Swedish population of 193,893. Changes over time was tested using multilevel Cox proportional hazard models. We tested how gender-specific risks of mental disorder changed and how gender-specific socioeconomic status was related to risks of mental disorder later in life. We found a reversal in gender gaps in mental health during the study period. Women had a lower risk than men in 1900 and higher risks in 1959. For men, we found a negative gradient in SES risks in 1900 and a positive gradient in 1959. For women, we found no clear SES gradient in the risk of mental disorder. These findings suggest that the contemporary patterns in socioeconomic and gender gaps in mental disorder emerged during the 1940s and 1950s and have since then persisted.","['Junkka, Johan', 'Sandstrom, Glenn', 'Vikstrom, Lotta']","['Junkka J', 'Sandstrom G', 'Vikstrom L']","['Centre for Demographic and Ageing Research, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Centre for Demographic and Ageing Research, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Historical, Philosophical and Religious Studies, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Centre for Demographic and Ageing Research, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Historical, Philosophical and Religious Studies, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200430,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Geography', '*Health Status Disparities', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', '*Social Class', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC7192474,,,,2020/05/01 06:00,2020/08/01 06:00,['2020/05/01 06:00'],"['2020/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-20-01789 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0232462 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Apr 30;15(4):e0232462. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0232462. eCollection 2020.,4,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1527-279X'],,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Mental Health First Aid concept (MHFA) was founded in 2000 in Australia by Kitchener and Jorm, in order to provide the population with mental health first aid skills. The aim of the concept is, through an educational intervention (course), to increase confidence in how to help people suffering from mental health problems. Further, secondary aims are to increase the mental health literacy of the public by increasing knowledge, reduce stigma and initiate more supportive actions leading towards professional care. An investigation of the effect of MHFA offered a Danish population is needed. METHODS: The design is a randomized waitlist-controlled superiority trial, in which 500 participants will be allocated to either the intervention group or the control group. The control group will attend the course six months later, hence waiting list design. From fall 2013 to spring 2014 participants will be educated to be ""mental health first-aiders"" following a manualized, two days MHFA course. All the participants will answer a questionnaire at base-line and at 6 months follow-up. The questionnaire is a back-translation of the questionnaire used in Australian trials. The trial will be complemented by a qualitative study, in which focus groups will be carried out. DISCUSSION: Outcomes measured are sensitive to interpretation, hence a challenge to uniform. This trial will add to the use of a mixed-methods design and exemplify how it can strengthen the analysis and take up the challenge of a sensitive outcome.

For example, psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and anxiety disorders have higher prevalence rates across a spectrum of autoimmune conditions compared to the general population. Additionally, subclinical immunological abnormalities are observed in a variety of psychiatric conditions, with chronic inflammation most extensively studied in the pathophysiology of depression. These observations blur the historical distinctions between mental and physical illness, yet clinical practice remains fragmented and primarily focused on differentially treating individual symptoms. PROPOSED THESIS: Therapeutically targeting inflammation offers translational opportunities for integrating mental and physical healthcare, a key niche of the interdisciplinary field of health psychology. CONCLUSION: Utilizing a psychoneuroimmunological lens, health psychologists and clinicians can reconceptualize healthcare through integrative treatment approaches and advocacy for comprehensive policy-level reform at both the individual-level of care as well as community-wide prevention approaches.","['Alessi, Maria G', 'Bennett, Jeanette M']","['Alessi MG', 'Bennett JM']","['Health Psychology PhD Program, UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA.', 'Health Psychology PhD Program, UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Psychological Science, UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200314,England,J Eval Clin Pract,Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,9609066,IM,"['*Behavioral Medicine', '*Bipolar Disorder', 'Humans', '*Mental Disorders', 'Mental Health', 'Psychoneuroimmunology', '*Schizophrenia']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['health psychology', 'immune health', 'mental health', 'psychoneuroimmunology']",2020/03/15 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/03/15 06:00'],"['2019/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jep.13386 [doi]'],ppublish,J Eval Clin Pract. 2020 Oct;26(5):1539-1547. doi: 10.1111/jep.13386.

Usually, categorical indicators of adolescent mental health issues (yes/no psychiatric disorder) are used in studies into long-term functional outcomes. This however does not take into account the full spectrum of mental health, nor does it consider the trajectory of mental health problem development over time. The aim of this study was twofold: (1) to identify distinct developmental trajectories of (co-occurring) internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms over the course of adolescence (ages 11-19), and (2) to document the associations between these adolescent trajectories and economic, social, and health outcomes in young adulthood (age 22), unadjusted and adjusted for childhood functioning, putative confounders and current mental health. METHODS: Data were used from the Dutch TRAILS cohort study (subsample n = 1524, 47.3% males). Self-reported INT and EXT symptoms using the Youth/Adult Self Report were assessed four times (ages 11y, 13y, 16y, 19y). Adolescent mental health trajectories were estimated using Parallel-Processes Latent Class Growth Analyses. Self-reported economic, social, and health outcomes and parent-reported current mental health (using Adult Behaviour Checklist) were assessed at age 22. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to test associations between trajectories and outcomes. RESULTS: Four distinct trajectory classes were identified: (1) a normative class with decreasing-low INT+EXT symptoms (n = 460), (2) continuous moderately-high INT+EXT (n = 298), (3) continuous moderate, INT>EXT (n = 414), and (4) decreasing moderate, EXT>INT (n = 352). Compared to the normative class, the other three trajectories generally predicted less optimal early-adult outcomes, with the strongest effects observed for individuals with continuous moderate-high levels of both INT and EXT symptoms throughout adolescence. The associations largely remained after adjustment for pre-adolescent functioning, selected confounders and current mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Both adolescent trajectories and current mental health had substantial independent effects on early-adult functioning.","['Oerlemans, Anoek M', 'Wardenaar, Klaas J', 'Raven, Dennis', 'Hartman, Catharina A', 'Ormel, Johan']","['Oerlemans AM', 'Wardenaar KJ', 'Raven D', 'Hartman CA', 'Ormel J']","['Department of Psychiatry, Interdisciplinary Center Psychopathology and Emotion Regulation (ICPE), University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Interdisciplinary Center Psychopathology and Emotion Regulation (ICPE), University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Interdisciplinary Center Psychopathology and Emotion Regulation (ICPE), University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Interdisciplinary Center Psychopathology and Emotion Regulation (ICPE), University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Interdisciplinary Center Psychopathology and Emotion Regulation (ICPE), University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200610,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Self Report/statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",PMC7286481,,,,2020/06/11 06:00,2020/08/21 06:00,['2020/06/11 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-19-24355 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0233648 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Jun 10;15(6):e0233648. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0233648. eCollection 2020.,6,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2922-1099'],,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This reflects persistent stigma as well as inadequate preparatory training or continuing education for healthcare professionals, including nurses. OBJECTIVE: To explore the impacts of the 1-day 'Enhancing Concurrent Disorder Care Intervention' on nurses' and student nurses' capacity to deliver care, grounded in current evidence, to patients with concurrent disorders in inpatient mental health settings. DESIGN: A Quasi-experimental intervention design was used with pre- and post(t)-test components, guided by the STROBE checklist for observational studies. SETTINGS: Five acute mental health units across two hospitals in British Columbia, Canada, as well as two schools of nursing representing students completing clinical practicum rotations within these settings. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-six nurses (Registered Nurses and Registered Psychiatric Nurses) and student nurses practicing in inpatient mental health care. METHODS: This educational intervention was informed by a pilot study, which included content validation from international concurrent disorder experts, and further refined through collaborative processes with lived experience and nurse partners. Intervention impacts were examined using online surveys conducted prior to the intervention and within two weeks post-intervention. Surveys assessed knowledge and attitudes about concurrent disorders using a validated instrument and questions developed by the study team. Descriptive statistics alongside paired and independent t-tests and two-way ANOVAs were used to compare survey scores before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Findings indicate that the intervention was effective in improving participants' knowledge and attitudes toward patients with concurrent disorders across participant groups. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing care and outcomes for patients with concurrent disorders is a global priority. Brief educational interventions aimed at nurses can provide an effective, low-barrier mechanism to address knowledge gaps that contribute to harmful care and adverse outcomes.","['Jenkins, Emily', 'Currie, Leanne M', 'Hirani, Saima', 'Garrod, Emma', 'Goodyear, Trevor', 'McGuinness, Liza', 'David, Anita', 'Bonnie, Kofi']","['Jenkins E', 'Currie LM', 'Hirani S', 'Garrod E', 'Goodyear T', 'McGuinness L', 'David A', 'Bonnie K']","['School of Nursing, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.

Increasingly, children with mental disorders seek care in the emergency department (ED). However, the ED is not an ideal setting. Pediatric mental health patients receive limited treatment and experience significantly longer length of stay (LOS) than other patients seen in the ED. This study examines patient and hospital factors associated with LOS and prolonged LOS (PLOS). METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of patients between the ages of 3 and 17 presenting at 2 participating urban EDs with a psychiatric diagnosis from May 2010 to May 2012. RESULTS: This study includes 939 patients with an average age of 14.1 years and a median LOS of 295 minutes. The diagnosis was the strongest predictor of LOS and PLOS. Patients with a psychotic disorder or suicide attempt or ideation experienced a longer LOS, 35% and 55% increases, respectively, and an increased odds of PLOS (odds ratio, 3.07 and 8.36, respectively). Patient sex, previous history of self-harm, and the daily census were associated with both a longer LOS and PLOS. Ethnicity, site of admission, and year of admission were only associated with LOS. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis-specific management factors are the primary determinant of LOS. However, some patient characteristics and hospital operational factors are also associated with LOS. Organizational reforms and an evaluation of the required human and material resources are necessary to improve access to and availability of pediatric mental health care.","['Chakravarthy, Bharath', 'Yang, Allen', 'Ogbu, Uzor', 'Kim, Carole', 'Iqbal, Anum', 'Haight, Joanna', 'Anderson, Craig', 'DiMassa, Giancarlo', 'Bruckner, Tim', 'Bhargava, Rishi', 'Schreiber, Merrit', 'Lotfipour, Shahram']","['Chakravarthy B', 'Yang A', 'Ogbu U', 'Kim C', 'Iqbal A', 'Haight J', 'Anderson C', 'DiMassa G', 'Bruckner T', 'Bhargava R', 'Schreiber M', 'Lotfipour S']","['From the *Department of Emergency Medicine, University of California, Irvine Health School of Medicine, Orange; daggerDepartment of Emergency Medicine, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, Long Beach; and double daggerDepartment of Social Ecology, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Emerg Care,Pediatric emergency care,8507560,IM,"['Adolescent', 'California/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Emergency Service, Hospital/*organization & administration', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Hospitals, Urban/organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/psychology/therapy', 'Mental Health/ethnology/standards', 'Psychiatry/organization & administration/standards', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,2015/09/30 06:00,2018/05/19 06:00,['2015/09/30 06:00'],"['2015/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2015/09/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PEC.0000000000000509 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Emerg Care. 2017 Sep;33(9):613-619. doi: 10.1097/PEC.0000000000000509.,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The act also restricts the use of managed care tools that apply to behavioral health benefits in ways that differ from how they apply to medical-surgical benefits. The only precedent for this approach is Oregon's state parity law, which was implemented in 2007. The goal of this study was to estimate the effect of Oregon's parity law on expenditures for mental health and substance abuse treatment services. METHOD: The authors compared expenditures for commercially insured individuals in four Oregon health plans from 2005 through 2008 and a matched group of commercially insured individuals in Oregon who were exempt from parity. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, the authors analyzed the effect of comprehensive parity on spending for mental health and substance abuse services. RESULTS: Increases in spending on mental health and substance abuse services after implementation of Oregon's parity law were almost entirely the result of a general trend observed among individuals with and without parity. Expenditures per enrollee for mental health and substance abuse services attributable to parity were positive, but they did not differ significantly from zero in any of the four plans. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral health insurance parity rules that place restrictions on how plans manage mental health and substance abuse services can improve insurance protections without substantial increases in total costs.","['McConnell, K John', 'Gast, Samuel H N', 'Ridgely, M Susan', 'Wallace, Neal', 'Jacuzzi, Natalie', 'Rieckmann, Traci', 'McFarland, Bentson H', 'McCarty, Dennis']","['McConnell KJ', 'Gast SH', 'Ridgely MS', 'Wallace N', 'Jacuzzi N', 'Rieckmann T', 'McFarland BH', 'McCarty D']","['Oregon Health and Science University, USA. mcconnjo@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 DA024024/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA024024-03/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DA024024/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110902,United States,Am J Psychiatry,The American journal of psychiatry,0370512,IM,"['Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Insurance Coverage/economics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Insurance, Health/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Mental Disorders/economics/*therapy', 'Mental Health/economics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Mental Health Services/economics/legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical data', 'Oregon', 'Substance-Related Disorders/economics/*therapy', 'United States']",PMC3263406,['NIHMS348851'],,,2011/09/06 06:00,2012/02/23 06:00,['2011/09/06 06:00'],"['2011/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['appi.ajp.2011.11020320 [pii]', '10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.11020320 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Psychiatry. 2012 Jan;169(1):31-8. doi: 10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.11020320.

The Prevail intervention programme aims to reduce stigma and to educate staff and managers about evidence-based low intensity psychological interventions for common mental disorders (depression, anxiety, stress, and distress). Prevail is innovative in taking a public health approach. It is designed to be given to all employees irrespective of their past or current mental health. Prevail was evaluated in three studies examining: (1) the acceptability of the intervention and perceived usefulness; (2) whether the intervention altered stigmatic attitudes and motivation to seek help; and (3) whether the intervention reduced sickness absence, both overall and due to mental health problems. METHODS: A two-armed cluster randomised control trial (RCT) evaluated the effectiveness of Prevail. Employees (N = 1051) at a large UK government institution were randomised to an active intervention or control arm in teams identified by their managers (n = 67). Employees in the active arm received the Prevail Staff Intervention. The managers in the active arm also received the Prevail Managers Intervention. Participants' satisfaction and analysis of the Prevail Intervention were gathered by a bespoke questionnaire. Questionnaire measures of attitudes to mental health and mental health stigma were taken 1-2 weeks prior to the intervention and approximately 4 weeks post-intervention. Data relating to sickness absence were gathered via the official records in the time period 3-month post-intervention and for the same period 12 months earlier. RESULTS: Prevail was evaluated highly favourably by both the staff and their managers. Prevail produced significant reductions in self-stigma and anticipated stigma due to mental health difficulties. Crucially, sickness absence was significantly reduced by the Prevail Intervention. DISCUSSION: Prevail achieved its goals of producing a palatable and engaging intervention that altered staff's attitudes and stigmatic beliefs related to mental health and, crucially, produced a strong reduction in work-pace absenteeism. As the Prevail programme is aimed at common mental health problems and was not specialised to this particular workforce, the study provides the evidence-base for a mental health intervention programme that could be used by many organisations across the world.

Four latent classes were identified: income hardship, divorce, mental health or substance abuse exposure, and high ACEs overall. Children in three of the four classes were significantly more likely to have any childhood internalizing disorder when compared to children reporting no ACEs, while children in all classes were significantly more likely to have a comorbid history of anxiety and depression.

Since a large proportion of lifetime mental illness starts before adulthood, such interventions are particularly important during childhood and adolescence. Prevention is important for the sustainable reduction of the burden of mental disorder since once it has arisen, treatment can only reduce a relatively small proportion of such burden. The challenge for clinicians is to incorporate such interventions into non-clinical and clinical practice as well as engaging with a range of other service providers including public health. Similar strategies can be employed in both the European and global contexts. Promotion of mental well-being can prevent mental disorder but is also important in the recovery from mental disorder.

Health system and individual level factors such as lack of mental health professionals and infrastructure, poor awareness about mental health, stigma related to help seeking, are responsible for poor awareness and use of mental health services. We implemented a mental health services delivery model that leveraged technology and task sharing to facilitate identification and treatment of common mental disorders (CMDs) such as stress, depression, anxiety and suicide risk in rural areas of the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. The intervention was delivered by lay village health workers (Accredited Social Health Activists - ASHAs) and primary care doctors. An anti-stigma campaign was implemented prior to this activity. This paper reports the process evaluation of the intervention using mixed methods. METHODS: A mixed methods pre-post evaluation assessed the intervention using quantitative service usage analytics from the server, and qualitative interviews with different stakeholders. Barriers and facilitators in implementing the intervention were identified. RESULTS: Health service use increased significantly at post-intervention, ASHAs could followup 78.6% of those who had screened positive, and 78.6% of the 1243 Interactive Voice Response System calls made, were successful. Most respondents were aware of the intervention. They indicated that knowledge received through the intervention empowered them to approach ASHAs and share their mental health symptoms. ASHAs and doctors opined that EDSS was useful and easy to use. Medical camps organized in villages to increase access to the doctor were received positively by all. However, some aspects or facilitators of the intervention need to be improved, including network connectivity, booster training, anti-stigma campaigns, quality of mental health services provided by doctors, provision of psychotropic medications at primary health centers and frequency of health camps. CONCLUSION: The respondents' views helped to understand the barriers and facilitators for improving the likely effectiveness of the intervention using Andersen's Modified Behavioral Model of Health Services Use, and identify the mechanisms by which those factors affected mental health services uptake in the community.

The project was implemented during March - November 2018 in the Belgorod Oblast of the Russian Federation. The study implemented such methods of collecting primary sociological data as monitoring of educational and social activities of individuals with mental health problems residing in psycho-neurological boarding school; half-structured interview of experts - employees of psycho-neurological boarding school and teachers. Actually, social adaptation of individuals with mental health problems is an acute social problem. They belong to the most vulnerable population group wrapped with complex of social stereotypes and various signs of social deadaptation. The social adaptation of such personalities is achieved by involvement into social educational activities. The study results demonstrated that there are a number of psychological and pedagogical difficulties in face-to-face training for individuals with mental health problems. Among them are serious emotional reactions in response to actions of teacher or other students; behavior disorders, decreasing of education motivation, inadequate self-assessment. The remote education permits to avoid these and other difficulties. The individual with mental health problems while in appropriate comfortable conditions can receive effective education, support themselves materially and be useful member of society. The study established such most effective methods of remote education for individuals with mental health problems as information-receptive method; reproductive method; method of cognitive visualization of case studies from practice and research method.","['Volkova, O A', 'Voloshina, I G', 'Dolya, R Yu', 'Kadutsky, R A']","['Volkova OA', 'Voloshina IG', 'Dolya RY', 'Kadutsky RA']","['The Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education ""The Belgorod State National Research University"", 308009, Belgorod, Russia, volkovaoa@rambler.ru.', 'The Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education ""The Belgorod State National Research University"", 308009, Belgorod, Russia.', 'The Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education ""The Belgorod State National Research University"", 308009, Belgorod, Russia.', 'The Federal State Public Educational Institution of High Education ""The I.

Social media are ubiquitous today, and adolescents use them to express their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. New interdisciplinary methods allow the automatic analysis of the massive amounts of data (big data) available on social networking websites using machine-learning tools to detect indicators of mental-health problems and disorders by identifying differences with common activity and communication patterns. This review first introduces the concept and potential fields of applications of big data in social media. It then discusses the first studies that used big data analyses and detected mental-health problems by identifying differences in the structure of social networks, in the use of certain words, and in the communication of opinions and sentiments. Future studies employing several assessment points could use longitudinal mediation analysis to model intraindividual changes in order to understand when and through which mechanisms social media use has an impact on mental health. Furthermore, future studies should include additional mental disorders, various sources of information, a broader age range, and additional social-networking websites to develop more precise models for the early detection of mental disorders. This would enable the development of personalised intervention programs to promote mental health and resilience in adolescents.","['Schmidt, Stefanie J', 'Kaess, Michael']","['Schmidt SJ', 'Kaess M']","['Abteilung fur Klinische Psychologie und Psychotherapie, Universitat Bern, Schweiz.', 'Universitatsklinik fur Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Universitat Bern, Schweiz.', 'Universitatsklinik fur Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Universitat Bern, Schweiz.', 'Sektion fur Translationale Psychobiologie in der Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie, Klinik fur Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie, Zentrum fur Psychosoziale Medizin, Universitatsklinikum Heidelberg, Deutschland.']",['ger'],,['Journal Article'],20181030,Switzerland,Z Kinder Jugendpsychiatr Psychother,Zeitschrift fur Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und Psychotherapie,9801717,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', '*Big Data', 'Communication', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Social Media/*statistics & numerical data']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adoleszenz', 'Big Data', 'Digitalisierung', 'Fruherkennung', 'Pravention', 'adolescence', 'big data', 'digital', 'early detection', 'prevention', 'social media', 'soziale Medien']",2018/10/31 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2018/10/31 06:00'],"['2018/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1024/1422-4917/a000623 [doi]'],ppublish,Z Kinder Jugendpsychiatr Psychother. 2020 Jan;48(1):47-56. doi: 10.1024/1422-4917/a000623.

METHODS: A pilot study was conducted using an EMHA questionnaire with questions about depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol use, sleep and anger/irritability. At pilot sites, the EMHA was completed during all routine and discharge medicals between May 2011 and July 2011. At the end of the study period, qualitative data were collected from participating medical officers and practice managers regarding their opinions about the pilot study. RESULTS: The quantitative data revealed an average pick-up rate for mental health (MH) problems. Out of the four military medical centres who participated and the 325 questionnaires collected, one referral to a Department of Community Mental Health was made. 26 (8%) patients were categorised as 'some concern and patient offered advice and/or reassurance'. The vast majority of patients were found to have no evidence of MH problems. However, using a validated alcohol screening tool, 64% of service personnel were found to have a score indicating 'higher risk drinking'. Analysis of the qualitative data suggests that the EMHA is an easy tool to implement with minimal additional time and resources needed. The interviewees pointed out a number of limitations and suggestions for possible further studies. CONCLUSIONS: The pilot study successfully demonstrated that the EMHA questionnaire is easy to administer, does not take up a large amount of additional resources or manpower and provides a useful check of MH status.

We know from international studies that the transition process makes adolescents vulnerable to mental illness. However, little is known about Belgian ATYA mental-health status. Nor are risk factors associated with their mental illness understood, in particular with regard to depressive and anxiety disorder. The aim of this study is (1) to discuss evolution in time of prevalence of depressive disorder (DD) and anxiety disorder (AD) among Belgian ATYA and (2), to identify risk factors associated with these disorders among ATYA. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data was extracted from the Belgian Health Interview Survey (BHIS), which is a cross-sectional population survey, carried out in 2001, 2004, 2008, and 2013. Information about the population's background characteristics, health services utilization, health behaviours and mental health status were extracted and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: ATYA prevalence of DD and AD was higher in 2013 in comparison with previous years. These changes were significant only for DD (F=4.466, p=0.004). In contrast with younger adolescents, among ATYA odds of DD were 28.2% higher (OR 1.282, 95% CI 0.967-1.698, p=0.084) and, odds of AD were 55.2% higher (OR 1.552, 95% CI 1.137-2.119, p=0.006). For ATYA, a poor quality of social support was the most predictive factor of DD (OR 11.187, 95% CI 5.530-22.629, p<0.0001) and AD (OR 6.238, 95% CI 2.845-13.676, p<0.0001); whereas, having a paid job was the most protective factor with regard to DD (OR 0.282, 95% CI 0.169-0.470, p<0.0001) and AD (OR 0.552, 95% CI 0.330-0.924, p<0.024). CONCLUSION: Prevalence of mental illness among Belgian ATYA appears to worsen in time. In comparison with younger adolescents, ATYA are more vulnerable to anxiety disorders. Adverse and protective risk factors were identified and discussed in a way to improve access, continuity and mental healthcare pathways for Belgian ATYA.","['Lepiece, Brice', 'Zdanowicz, Nicolas', 'de Becker, Emmanuel', 'de Timary, Philippe', 'Lorant, Vincent']","['Lepiece B', 'Zdanowicz N', 'de Becker E', 'de Timary P', 'Lorant V']","['Universite Catholique de Louvain, Institute for Health and Society (IRSS).

The aim of this study was to assess how common cocaine use is, and its mental health associations, in a large sample of university students. METHODS: Approximately 10 000 university students were invited to take part in an online survey, which assessed the use of cocaine (ever or past year), alcohol and drug use, mental health issues, and impulsive and compulsive tendencies. Group differences in demographic and clinical characteristics were characterized. RESULTS: A total of 3520 university students (57.7% female) completed the survey. Of these, 110 students (3.1%) reported using cocaine in the preceding year, and a further 163 students (4.6%) reported historical use more than a year ago. Cocaine use was associated with more years as a student, lower grade point averages, more use of other drugs, riskier sexual practices, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, treatment for psychological/emotional problems (including taking prescribed medication), and trait impulsivity. Of these associations, the link with trait impulsivity had the largest effect size. CONCLUSION: History of cocaine use appears relatively common in university students; and has a number of untoward associations in terms of mental health, use of other substances, and risky sexual practices. The most marked finding (in terms of effect size) was the link between cocaine use and trait impulsivity, supporting the importance of this construct in seeking out candidate vulnerability markers for use of cocaine and other drugs. Future work should use longitudinal designs to further characterize the nature of these associations.","['Chamberlain, Samuel R', 'Lust, Katherine', 'Grant, Jon E']","['Chamberlain SR', 'Lust K', 'Grant JE']","['Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Boynton Health Service, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MinnesotaUSA.', 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],['110049/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200630,United States,CNS Spectr,CNS spectrums,9702877,IM,"['Cocaine-Related Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Demography/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Male', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Safe Sex/statistics & numerical data', 'Students/*statistics & numerical data', 'Universities/statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",PMC8524652,['EMS86532'],['NOTNLM'],"['addiction', 'compulsivity', 'drugs', 'illicit', 'impulsivity', 'stimulant']",2020/07/01 06:00,2022/02/16 06:00,['2020/07/01 06:00'],"['2020/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/02/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['S1092852920001492 [pii]', '10.1017/S1092852920001492 [doi]']",ppublish,CNS Spectr. 2021 Oct;26(5):501-508. doi: 10.1017/S1092852920001492.

Higher rates of psychiatric illness are common when more than one disorder is present. Yet little is known about the rates and risk factors for EDs/ED symptoms in women attending treatment centers in Australia. The primary aim is to examine the prevalence of ED symptoms among women attending treatment centers. This study also examines past physical and sexual abuse and mental health as specific predictors of EDs/ED symptoms. Methods: Participants were 1,444 women attending residential treatment for substance use issues provided by the Salvation Army in Australia. Measures included the Addiction Severity Index, the Eating Disorder Screen for Primary Care, medication use, hospitalization, mental health, and past abuse. Results: Alcohol was the primary substance of concern for 53.3% of the women, followed by amphetamines (17.5%), and the mean age was 37.83 years (SD = 10.8). Nearly 60% of women screened positive for ED symptoms and 32% reported a previous or current ED. Women with a history of sexual abuse had significantly greater odds (1.96) of positive screening for an ED compared to those without a history of sexual abuse. Similarly, compared to women without a history of physical abuse, those who did have a history had significantly higher odds (1.59) of a positive screen for an ED. These women were also significantly more likely to have had a health care provider recommend they take medications for psychological or emotional problems in the past 30 days, chi(2)(1) = 8.42, p = .004, and during their lifetime, chi(2)(1) = 17.89, p < .001. They also had a significantly greater number of overnight hospitalizations for medical problems compared to those who screened negative, t(137) = -2.19, p = .03. Conclusions: Women with comorbid substance use issues and EDs are highly likely to have a history of past abuse. This combination of comorbidities makes treatment and recovery difficult. Increased awareness and research are required to explore integrated approaches to treatment that accommodate these vulnerabilities and improve long-term outcomes.","['Robinson, Laura D', 'Kelly, Peter J', 'Deane, Frank P', 'Reis, Samantha L']","['Robinson LD', 'Kelly PJ', 'Deane FP', 'Reis SL']","['School of Psychology, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia.', 'Illawarra Institute for Mental Health, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia.', 'School of Psychology, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia.', 'Illawarra Institute for Mental Health, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia.', 'School of Psychology, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia.', 'Illawarra Institute for Mental Health, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia.', 'School of Psychology, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190913,United States,J Dual Diagn,Journal of dual diagnosis,101197457,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry)', 'Feeding and Eating Disorders/*epidemiology/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Residential Treatment', 'Risk Factors', 'Substance-Related Disorders/*epidemiology/*psychology/therapy', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Substance use', 'co-occurring disorders', 'eating disorder symptoms', 'treatment']",2019/09/15 06:00,2020/08/11 06:00,['2019/09/15 06:00'],"['2019/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/09/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15504263.2019.1660019 [doi]'],ppublish,J Dual Diagn. 2019 Oct-Dec;15(4):270-280. doi: 10.1080/15504263.2019.1660019.

Treatment for these disorders is limited in low- and middle-income countries. This systematic review synthesizes the implementation processes and examines the effectiveness of psychological treatments for common mental disorders in adults delivered by nonspecialist providers in low- and middle-income countries. In total, 27 trials met the eligibility criteria; most treatments targeted depression or posttraumatic stress. Treatments were commonly delivered by community health workers or peers in primary care or community settings; they usually were delivered with fewer than 10 sessions over 2-3 months in an individual, face-to-face format. Treatments included common elements, such as nonspecific engagement and specific domains of behavioral, interpersonal, emotional, and cognitive elements. The pooled effect size was 0.49 (95% confidence interval = 0.36-0.62), favoring intervention conditions. Our review demonstrates that psychological treatments-comprising a parsimonious set of common elements and delivered by a low-cost, widely available human resource-have moderate to strong effects in reducing the burden of common mental disorders.","['Singla, Daisy R', 'Kohrt, Brandon A', 'Murray, Laura K', 'Anand, Arpita', 'Chorpita, Bruce F', 'Patel, Vikram']","['Singla DR', 'Kohrt BA', 'Murray LK', 'Anand A', 'Chorpita BF', 'Patel V']","['Sinai Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 1X5.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5T 1R8; email: daisy.singla@sinaihealthsystem.ca.', 'Duke Global Health Institute, Department of Psychiatry, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27710; email: brandon.kohrt@duke.edu.', 'Department of Mental Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21205; email: lmurra15@jhu.edu.', 'Sangath, Goa, India 403501; email: anand.arpita@gmail.com.', 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095; email: chorpita@ucla.edu.', 'Sangath, Goa, India 403501; email: anand.arpita@gmail.com.', 'Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115; email: vikram.patel@hms.harvard.edu.', 'Centre for Chronic Conditions and Injuries, Public Health Foundation of India, Gurgaon India 122022.']",['eng'],"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'K01 MH104310/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 MH095687/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', '106919/Z/15/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Annu Rev Clin Psychol,Annual review of clinical psychology,101235325,IM,"['Developing Countries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Global Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*therapy', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Psychotherapy/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC5506549,['NIHMS877140'],['NOTNLM'],"['common elements', 'global mental health', 'implementation processes', 'low- and middle-income countries', 'meta-analysis', 'psychological treatments', 'systematic review']",2017/05/10 06:00,2018/03/14 06:00,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032816-045217 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Clin Psychol. 2017 May 8;13:149-181. doi: 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032816-045217.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In March through April 2018 (6 months after Hurricane Maria), an online survey was used to assess the effects of the storm on mental health. A sample of 213 displaced Puerto Ricans living in urban and rural/suburban areas in Florida, as well as urban and rural areas of Puerto Rico, participated in the study. RESULTS: Rates of PTSD were high in both sites (Florida, 65.7%; Puerto Rico, 43.6%); however, participants in Florida were far more likely than those in Puerto Rico to meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD (OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.67-5.26). Among participants in both Florida and Puerto Rico, those living in urban areas were more likely than those in rural/suburban areas to meet criteria for PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that post-Hurricane Maria adjustment and adaptation may have been more psychologically taxing for Puerto Ricans who moved to Florida than it was for those who remained on the island, and more difficult for those in urban areas than it was for those in suburban or rural areas.

However, mental health at work is a crucial issue involving substantial costs and consequences. The aim of the study was to assess changes in behaviors and indicators of mental health in the French working population between 2006 and 2010, and to explore the differential changes according to age, origin, occupation, activity sector, public/private sector, self-employed/employee status and work contract. METHODS: The data came from the prospective national representative Sante et itineraire professionnel (SIP) survey, including a sample of 5600 French workers interviewed in 2006 and 2010. The behaviors and indicators of mental health studied were excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, sleep problems (sleep disorders and/or insufficient sleep duration), psychotropic drug use (antidepressants, anxiolytics and/or hypnotics), and poor self-reported health. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze changes in behaviors and indicators of mental health, and the analyses were adjusted for age. Covariates (age, origin, occupation, activity sector, public/private sector, self-employed/employee status and type of contract) were added separately to assess differential changes. RESULTS: Increases in excessive alcohol consumption among women, sleep problems among men, and smoking, insufficient sleep duration and poor self-reported health for both genders were observed in the French working population between 2006 and 2010. Some differential changes were observed, negative changes being more likely to affect young workers and workers with a permanent contract. CONCLUSION: Prevention policies should consider that behavior and indicators of mental health may deteriorate in times of economic crisis, especially among some sub-groups of the working population, such as young workers and workers with a permanent contract. These changes might foreshadow a forthcoming increase in mental disorders.","['Malard, L', 'Chastang, J-F', 'Niedhammer, I']","['Malard L', 'Chastang JF', 'Niedhammer I']","[""Inserm, UMR_S 1136, Institut Pierre-Louis d'epidemiologie et de sante publique, Equipe de recherche en epidemiologie sociale, 75013 Paris, France; Institut Pierre-Louis d'epidemiologie et de sante publique, Equipe de recherche en epidemiologie sociale, Sorbonne universites, UPMC universite Paris 06, UMR S 1136, 75013 Paris, France; Universite de Versailles-Saint-Quentin, 78000 Versailles, France."", ""Inserm, UMR_S 1136, Institut Pierre-Louis d'epidemiologie et de sante publique, Equipe de recherche en epidemiologie sociale, 75013 Paris, France; Institut Pierre-Louis d'epidemiologie et de sante publique, Equipe de recherche en epidemiologie sociale, Sorbonne universites, UPMC universite Paris 06, UMR S 1136, 75013 Paris, France."", ""Inserm, UMR_S 1136, Institut Pierre-Louis d'epidemiologie et de sante publique, Equipe de recherche en epidemiologie sociale, 75013 Paris, France; Institut Pierre-Louis d'epidemiologie et de sante publique, Equipe de recherche en epidemiologie sociale, Sorbonne universites, UPMC universite Paris 06, UMR S 1136, 75013 Paris, France.

Despite the implementation of strategies for promotion and prevention in mental health WHO's Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013(-)2020, the difficulty of diagnosis of mental disorders makes the objective ""To provide comprehensive, integrated, and responsive mental health and social care services in community-based settings"" hard to carry out. This paper presents a mental-disorder-aided diagnosis model (MDAD) to quantify the multipolarity sentiment affect intensity of users' short texts in social networks in order to analyze the 11-dimensional sentiment distribution. We searched the five mental disorder topics and collected data based on Twitter hashtag. Through sentiment distribution similarity calculations and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), people with a high probability of suffering from mental disorder can be detected in real time. In particular, mental health warnings can be made in time for users with an obvious emotional tendency in their tweets. In the experiments, we make a comprehensive evaluation of MDAD by five common adult mental disorders: depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, and panic disorder. Our proposed model can effectively diagnose common mental disorders by sentiment multipolarity analysis, providing strong support for the prevention and diagnosis of mental disorders.","['Zhou, Tie Hua', 'Hu, Gong Liang', 'Wang, Ling']","['Zhou TH', 'Hu GL', 'Wang L']","['Department of Computer Science and Technology, School of Computer Science, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin 132000, China. thzhou@neepu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Computer Science and Technology, School of Computer Science, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin 132000, China. 2201600508@neepu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Computer Science and Technology, School of Computer Science, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin 132000, China. smile2867ling@neepu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190316,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,IM,"['Adult', '*Anxiety Disorders', 'Data Collection', 'Emotions', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mental Health', '*Perception', 'Psychological Techniques', '*Social Networking']",PMC6466382,,['NOTNLM'],"['emotion perception', 'machine learning', 'psychological disorder', 'sentiments distribution', 'social network']",2019/03/20 06:00,2019/07/23 06:00,['2019/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph16060953 [pii]', 'ijerph-16-00953 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph16060953 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2019 Mar 16;16(6):953. doi: 10.3390/ijerph16060953.,6,,,"['The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the', 'publication of this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to achieve these objectives two main approaches were used: (1) a brief history of the different treatments and research with patients with mental illness or disability; (2) theoretical and conceptual analysis of the main problems concerning the mental health field, namely the notion of vulnerability, responsibility and autonomy and the use of placebo control groups. Two main questions prompted the reflection on whether the patient with a mental disorder can sign an Informed Consent, and whether the use of a placebo is acceptable. The existence of antagonistic and contradictory positions indicates that mental health research is hampered by biases that are difficult to overcome. Ethical investigation that may contribute to the healing of mental disorders should not however be overlooked merely because of the difficulties involved in its implementation.

Our aim was to examine evidence on the burden of mental disorders and access to and effectiveness of mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services in Syria and among Syrian refugees in neighboring countries. METHODS: A systematic review was done following systematic review criteria. Twelve bibliographic databases and additional gray literature sources were searched for quantitative and qualitative studies. Descriptive analysis and quality assessment were conducted. RESULTS: Twenty-eight eligible studies were identified, of which two were with conflict-affected populations within Syria. Levels of post-traumatic stress disorder ranged from 16 to 84%, depression from 11 to 49%, and anxiety disorder from 49 to 55%. Common risk factors were exposures to trauma and having a personal or family history of mental disorder. Financial and socio-cultural barriers were identified as the main obstacles to accessing MHPSS care. Evaluations of MHPSS services, albeit from predominantly nonrandomised designs, reported positive treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The MHPSS burden was high, but with considerable variation between studies. There are key evidence gaps on: MHPSS burden and interventions-particularly for those living within Syria; access and barriers to care; and implementation and evaluation of MHPSS interventions.","['Hendrickx, M', 'Woodward, A', 'Fuhr, D C', 'Sondorp, E', 'Roberts, B']","['Hendrickx M', 'Woodward A', 'Fuhr DC', 'Sondorp E', 'Roberts B']","['London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'KIT Health, KIT Royal Tropical Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Health Services Research and Policy, Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'KIT Health, KIT Royal Tropical Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Health Services Research and Policy, Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",,England,J Public Health (Oxf),"Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",101188638,IM,"['Humans', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology/therapy', 'Mental Health', '*Mental Health Services', 'Psychosocial Support Systems', '*Refugees', 'Syria']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Syria', 'access', 'health services', 'mental health', 'refugees']",2019/11/07 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2019/11/06 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['5557733 [pii]', '10.1093/pubmed/fdz097 [doi]']",ppublish,J Public Health (Oxf). 2020 Aug 18;42(3):e299-e310. doi: 10.1093/pubmed/fdz097.,3,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

METHOD: The study used both quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitatively, the WHO Mental Health Policy and Plan Checklist and the WHO Mental Health Legislation Checklist were employed to analyse the content of mental health policy, plans and legislation in Ghana. Qualitative data was gathered using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with key stakeholders in mental health at the macro, meso and micro levels. These were used to identify barriers to the implementation of mental health policy, and steps to overcoming these. RESULTS: Barriers to mental health policy implementation identified by participants include: low priority and lack of political commitment to mental health; limited human and financial resources: lack of intersectoral collaboration and consultation; inadequate policy dissemination; and an absence of research-based evidence to inform mental health policy. Suggested steps to overcoming the barriers include: revision of mental health policy and legislation; training and capacity development and wider consultation. CONCLUSION: These results call for well-articulated plans to address the barriers to the implementation of mental health policy in Ghana to reduce the burden associated with mental disorders.","['Awenva, A D', 'Read, U M', 'Ofori-Attah, A L', 'Doku, V C K', 'Akpalu, B', 'Osei, A O', 'Flisher, A J']","['Awenva AD', 'Read UM', 'Ofori-Attah AL', 'Doku VC', 'Akpalu B', 'Osei AO', 'Flisher AJ']","['Kintampo Health Research Centre, Ghana. dawemva@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Afr J Psychiatry (Johannesbg),African journal of psychiatry,101465030,IM,"['Ghana', 'Health Services Research/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*legislation & jurisprudence', '*Policy Making', 'Qualitative Research']",,,,,2010/10/20 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2010/10/20 06:00'],"['2010/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Afr J Psychiatry (Johannesbg). 2010 Jul;13(3):184-91.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['MHaPP Research Programme Consortium'],"['Flisher, Alan J', 'Lund, Crick', 'Agossou, Therese', 'Drew, Natalie', 'Faydi, Edwige', 'Funk, Michelle', 'Bhana, Arvin', 'Doku, Victor', 'Green, Andrew', 'Omar, Mayeh', 'Kigozi, Fred', 'Knapp, Martin', 'Mayeya, John', 'Mulutsi, Eva N', 'Ndyanabangi, Sheila Zaramba', 'Ofori-Atta, Angela', 'Osei, Akwasi', 'Petersen, Inge']","['Flisher AJ', 'Lund C', 'Agossou T', 'Drew N', 'Faydi E', 'Funk M', 'Bhana A', 'Doku V', 'Green A', 'Omar M', 'Kigozi F', 'Knapp M', 'Mayeya J', 'Mulutsi EN', 'Ndyanabangi SZ', 'Ofori-Atta A', 'Osei A', 'Petersen I']",,,,,

Cardiovascular disease is the main contributor to this early mortality, caused by higher rates of smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, sleep disturbance, excessive alcohol use or substance abuse and medication side effects. Therefore, we need to take a preventative approach and translate effective interventions for physical health into routine clinical practice. These interventions should be delivered across all stages of mental health disorders and could also have the added benefit of leading to improvements in mental health. Furthermore, we need to advocate to ensure that people affected by severe mental health disorders receive the appropriate medical assessments and treatments when indicated. This themed issue highlights that physical health is now an urgent priority for funding and development in mental health services.

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis with adolescents (ages 9-19) attending a primary care clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. We analyzed the results of four self-report tools: Children's Depression Inventory-Short, Revised Manifest Anxiety Scale, Child Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist, and a modified version of the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Scale. We used robust Poisson regression to quantify the association between social support and mental health. Among 278 adolescents, the majority were perinatally infected with HIV (92%), and had at least one deceased parent (59%). Depression symptom threshold scores were found among 8% of adolescents, and 7% screened positive for symptoms of anxiety. Few (1%) met the criteria for PTSD. Overall, 12% of adolescents screened positive for symptoms of depression, anxiety or PTSD. Older adolescents reported less social support than younger adolescents. Adolescents were less likely to have mental health symptoms if they had higher measures of social support (adjusted Prevalence Ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.20-0.73). Attention should be paid to social support for adolescents living with HIV as this may play an important role in their mental health.","['West, Nora', 'Schwartz, Sheree', 'Mudavanhu, Mutsa', 'Hanrahan, Colleen', 'France, Holly', 'Nel, Jeremy', 'Mutunga, Lillian', 'Bernhardt, Shelley', 'Bassett, Jean', 'Van Rie, Annelies']","['West N', 'Schwartz S', 'Mudavanhu M', 'Hanrahan C', 'France H', 'Nel J', 'Mutunga L', 'Bernhardt S', 'Bassett J', 'Van Rie A']","['a Department of Epidemiology , Johns Hopkins School of Public Health , Baltimore , MD , USA.', 'a Department of Epidemiology , Johns Hopkins School of Public Health , Baltimore , MD , USA.', 'b Witkoppen Health and Welfare Centre , Johannesburg , South Africa.', 'a Department of Epidemiology , Johns Hopkins School of Public Health , Baltimore , MD , USA.', 'b Witkoppen Health and Welfare Centre , Johannesburg , South Africa.', 'c Department of Infectious Diseases , Helen Joseph Hospital , Johannesburg , South Africa.', 'b Witkoppen Health and Welfare Centre , Johannesburg , South Africa.', 'b Witkoppen Health and Welfare Centre , Johannesburg , South Africa.', 'b Witkoppen Health and Welfare Centre , Johannesburg , South Africa.', 'd University of Antwerp , Antwerp , Belgium.', 'e Department of Epidemiology , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Gillings School of Global Public Health , Chapel Hill , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181010,England,AIDS Care,AIDS care,8915313,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anxiety/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depression/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mental Health/ethnology/statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', '*Social Support', 'South Africa/epidemiology', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adolescent health', 'HIV', 'mental health', 'social support']",2018/10/12 06:00,2019/11/20 06:00,['2018/10/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09540121.2018.1533222 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Care. 2019 Jan;31(1):117-124. doi: 10.1080/09540121.2018.1533222.

One year after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, we surveyed a multi-ethnic population of New York City adults (N= 2,368). We assessed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression, panic attack, anxiety symptoms, and general physical and mental health status. We classified study respondents into ""low,"" ""moderate,"" or ""high"" acculturation, based on survey responses. Bivariate results indicated that low acculturation individuals were more likely to experience negative life events, have low social support, and less likely to have pre-disaster mental health disorders. Those in the low acculturation group were also more likely to experience post-disaster perievent panic attacks, have higher anxiety, and have poorer mental health status. However, using logistic regression to control for confounding, and adjusting for multiple comparisons, we found that none of these outcomes were associated with acculturation status. Thus, our study suggests that acculturation was not associated with mental health outcomes following a major traumatic event.","['Adams, Richard E', 'Boscarino, Joseph A']","['Adams RE', 'Boscarino JA']","['Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA.', 'Geisinger Clinic, Danville, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 MH066403/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 MH086317/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-MH66403/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Int J Emerg Ment Health,International journal of emergency mental health,100888872,IM,"['*Acculturation', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disasters', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'New York City/epidemiology', 'September 11 Terrorist Attacks/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",PMC4007276,['NIHMS554580'],,,2014/02/25 06:00,2014/08/16 06:00,['2014/02/25 06:00'],"['2014/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Emerg Ment Health. 2013;15(2):85-96.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to assess whether gender and socioeconomic inequalities in poor mental health have changed since the onset of austerity policies. DESIGN: Repeat cross-sectional analysis of survey data. SETTING: England. PARTICIPANTS: Nationally and regionally representative samples of the working-age population (25-64 years) from the Health Survey for England (1991-2014). OUTCOME MEASURES: Population-level poor mental health was measured by General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ) caseness, stratified by gender and socioeconomic position (area-level deprivation and highest educational attainment). RESULTS: The prevalence of age-adjusted male GHQ caseness increased by 5.9% (95% CI 3.2% to 8.5%, p<0.001) from 2008 to 2009 in the immediate postrecession period, but recovered to prerecession levels after 2010. In women, there was little change in 2009 or 2010, but an increase of 3.0% (95% CI 1.0% to 5.1%, p=0.004) in 2012 compared with 2008 following the onset of austerity. Estimates were largely unchanged after further adjustment for socioeconomic position, employment status and household income as potential mediators. Relative socioeconomic inequalities in GHQ caseness narrowed from 2008 to 2010 immediately following the recession, with Relative Index of Inequality falling from 2.28 (95% CI 1.89 to 2.76, p<0.001) to 1.85 (95% CI 1.43 to 2.38, p<0.001), but returned to prerecession levels during austerity. CONCLUSIONS: Gender inequalities in poor mental health narrowed following the Great Recession but widened during austerity, creating the widest gender gap since 1994. Socioeconomic inequalities in poor mental health narrowed immediately postrecession, but this trend may now be reversing. Austerity policies could contribute to widening mental health inequalities.","['Thomson, Rachel M', 'Niedzwiedz, Claire L', 'Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal']","['Thomson RM', 'Niedzwiedz CL', 'Katikireddi SV']","['MRC/CSO Social & Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Public Health Department, NHS Ayrshire & Arran, Ayr, UK.', 'Institute of Health & Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'MRC/CSO Social & Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['SPHSU13/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom', 'SPHSU15/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom', 'MR/R024774/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12017/15/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'SCAF/15/02/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12017/13/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180830,England,BMJ Open,BMJ open,101552874,IM,"['Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Economic Recession/*statistics & numerical data', '*Economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Employment/economics/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', '*Health Status Disparities', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/economics/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Mental Health/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",PMC6119415,,['NOTNLM'],"['epidemiology', 'mental health', 'public health', 'social medicine']",2018/09/01 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2018/09/01 06:00'],"['2018/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['bmjopen-2018-022924 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022924 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Open. 2018 Aug 30;8(8):e022924. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022924.,8,,,['Competing interests: None declared.'],"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

The aim of this study is to increase our knowledge about possible pathways to well-being and integration for unaccompanied refugee minors as they strive to establish new lives in a host county. The present study followed a group of youth who fled to Norway without their caregivers at three time points; 6 months (n = 95; M age = 13.8, 80% boys), 2 years (n = 78; M age = 16.5, 83% boys), and 5 years (n = 47; M age 20.0, 83% boys) after arrival. Linear mixed effects models were used to assess whether age, gender, and trauma exposure prior to arrival were associated with levels and changes in symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTS), depression, anxiety, and externalizing symptoms over time. Regression analyses were conducted to examine whether daily hassles, perceived social support, and new trauma experiences predict PTS, internalization, externalization, and somatization. The mean levels of depression had decreased significantly at 5 years, but mean levels of anxiety, PTS, and externalizing symptoms did not. Females and severely trauma exposed had higher levels of symptoms. Higher age was associated with less change in symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress over time. Five years after arrival, many still experienced clinical levels of mental health problems, and level of daily hassles was an important predictor. Support may be needed not only at arrival to handle mental health problems in general and posttraumatic stress in particular, but also after resettlement. Help to manage daily hassles may be especially important to ensure well-being and integration.","['Jensen, Tine K', 'Skar, Ane-Marthe Solheim', 'Andersson, Elin Sofia', 'Birkeland, Marianne Skogbrott']","['Jensen TK', 'Skar AS', 'Andersson ES', 'Birkeland MS']","['Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Forskningsveien 3A, 0373, Oslo, Norway. tine.jensen@psykologi.uio.no.', 'Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, Gullhaugveien 1-3, Nydalen, Oslo, Norway. tine.jensen@psykologi.uio.no.', 'Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, Gullhaugveien 1-3, Nydalen, Oslo, Norway.', 'University of Oslo, Forskningsveien 3A, 0373, Oslo, Norway.', 'Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, Gullhaugveien 1-3, Nydalen, Oslo, Norway.', 'Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, Gullhaugveien 1-3, Nydalen, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190419,Germany,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,European child & adolescent psychiatry,9212296,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*trends', 'Minors/*psychology', 'Refugees/*psychology', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*psychology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Asylum seekers', 'Daily hassles', 'Mental health trajectories', 'Social support', 'Somatic complaints', 'Trauma']",2019/04/21 06:00,2020/01/31 06:00,['2019/04/21 06:00'],"['2019/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00787-019-01340-6 [pii]', '10.1007/s00787-019-01340-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2019 Dec;28(12):1671-1682. doi: 10.1007/s00787-019-01340-6.

As the prevalence of infectious disease declines, mental disorders are emerging as major contributors to the global burden of disease. Scientists understand little about the etiology of mental disorders, however, and many of the most popular psychopharmacological treatments, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, have only moderate-to-weak efficacy in treating symptoms and fail to target biological systems that correspond to discrete psychiatric syndromes. Consequently, despite dramatic increases in the treatment of some mental disorders, there has been no decrease in the prevalence of most mental disorders since accurate record keeping began. Many researchers and theorists are therefore endeavoring to rethink psychiatry from the ground-up. Anthropology, especially biological anthropology, can offer critical theoretical and empirical insights to combat mental illness globally. Biological anthropologists are unique in that we take a panhuman approach to human health and behavior and are trained to address each of Tinbergen's four levels of analysis as well as culture. The field is thus exceptionally well-situated to help resolve the mysteries of mental illness by integrating biological, evolutionary, and sociocultural perspectives.","['Syme, Kristen L', 'Hagen, Edward H']","['Syme KL', 'Hagen EH']","['Department of Anthropology, Washington State University, Vancouver, Washington.', 'Department of Anthropology, Washington State University, Vancouver, Washington.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191124,United States,Am J Phys Anthropol,American journal of physical anthropology,0400654,IM,"['*Anthropology', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*therapy', '*Mental Health']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['evolutionary medicine', 'mental health', 'psychopathology']",2019/11/26 06:00,2020/12/18 06:00,['2019/11/26 06:00'],"['2019/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajpa.23965 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Phys Anthropol. 2020 May;171 Suppl 70:87-117. doi: 10.1002/ajpa.23965.

CMH includes optimal functioning as well as the absence of psychopathology. Methods: Secondary data analyses of the nationally representative 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health. This study used bivariate and logistic regression analyses to estimate the odds ratios of CMH among community dwellers aged 50 and older with current cancer (n = 438), previous cancer (n = 1,174) and no cancer history (n = 9,279). CMH had three elements: (1) absence of mental illness, addictions and suicidal thoughts in the past year; (2) almost daily happiness or life satisfaction in the past month; (3) psychosocial well-being. Control variables included socio-demographics, health behaviours, current physical health and lifetime history of mental illness and childhood maltreatment. Results: Adults aged 50 and over with current cancer had a much lower prevalence of CMH (66.1%) than those with previous cancer (77.5%) and those with no cancer history (76.8%). After adjusting for 17 variables, the odds of CMH among those with current cancer remained substantially lower (OR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.49-0.79) than those without cancer. Among those who had ever had cancer, the odds of CMH were higher for female, white, married, and older respondents, as well as those with higher socioeconomic status, and no history of childhood physical abuse, substance abuse, depression or anxiety disorder. Conclusions: Those with former cancer have comparable odds of CMH to those with no cancer history, suggesting a high level of resilience among cancer survivors.","['Fuller-Thomson, Esme', 'West, Keri J']","['Fuller-Thomson E', 'West KJ']","['a Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work , University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada.', 'b Institute for Life Course & Aging, University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada.', 'c Department of Family & Community Medicine , University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada.', 'a Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work , University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180821,England,Aging Ment Health,Aging & mental health,9705773,IM,"['Aged', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Resilience, Psychological']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Psychosocial oncology', 'complete mental health', 'mental health', 'mental illness', 'resilience']",2018/08/22 06:00,2020/09/30 06:00,['2018/08/22 06:00'],"['2018/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13607863.2018.1481926 [doi]'],ppublish,Aging Ment Health. 2019 Sep;23(9):1263-1274. doi: 10.1080/13607863.2018.1481926.

Digital mental health is a promising solution to this short-fall in view of the population's digital literacy. In this review, we aim to: (i) investigate the effectiveness, acceptability, usability, and safety of digital health technologies (DHTs) for people with mental health problems in China; (ii) critically appraise the literature; and (iii) make recommendations for future research directions. The databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, WANFANG, and VIP were systemically searched for English and Chinese language articles evaluating DHTs for people with mental health problems in mainland China. Eligible studies were systematically reviewed. The heterogeneity of studies included precluded a meta-analysis. In total, 39 articles were retrieved, reporting on 32 DHTs for various mental health problems. Compared with the digital mental health field in the West, the Chinese studies targeted schizophrenia and substance use disorder more often and investigated social anxiety mediated by shame and culturally specific variants, DHTs were rarely developed in a co-production approach, and methodology quality was less rigorous. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review focused on digital mental health in the Chinese context including studies published in both English and the Chinese language. DHTs were acceptable and usable among Chinese people with mental health problems in general, similar to findings from the West. Due to heterogeneity across studies and a paucity of robust control trial research, conclusions about the efficacy of DHTs are lacking.","['Zhang, Xiaolong', 'Lewis, Shon', 'Firth, Joseph', 'Chen, Xu', 'Bucci, Sandra']","['Zhang X', 'Lewis S', 'Firth J', 'Chen X', 'Bucci S']","['Division of Psychology and Mental Health, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'The National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders & Beijing Key Laboratory of Mental Disorders, Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Division of Psychology and Mental Health, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.', 'Division of Psychology and Mental Health, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'NICM Health Research Institute, Western Sydney University, Westmead, Australia.', 'The National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders & Beijing Key Laboratory of Mental Disorders, Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Advanced Innovation Center for Human Brain Protection, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Division of Psychology and Mental Health, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],['MR/T021780/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20210928,England,Psychol Med,Psychological medicine,1254142,IM,"['Humans', '*Mental Health', 'China', '*Substance-Related Disorders', 'Quality of Health Care']",PMC8579156,,['NOTNLM'],"['China', 'co-production', 'cultural adapation', 'digital mental health', 'schizophrenia', 'systematic review']",2021/09/29 06:00,2022/11/25 06:00,['2021/09/28 08:54'],"['2021/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/28 08:54 [entrez]']","['S0033291721003731 [pii]', '10.1017/S0033291721003731 [doi]']",ppublish,Psychol Med. 2021 Nov;51(15):2552-2570. doi: 10.1017/S0033291721003731.

Active duty soldiers with PTSD (N = 162) were randomized to 10 sessions of exposure therapy or a waitlist. Soldiers were assessed for PTSD and completed measures of stigma and attitudes towards mental health services before randomization and after 5- and 10- sessions of therapy. At post-treatment, soldiers in exposure therapy demonstrated significant improvements in openness to talking about mental health problems and concerns about what others may think if they knew they were seeking mental health treatment, relative to those in the waitlist. There were significant indirect effects from treatment to changes in stigma and attitudes towards mental health treatment through changes in PTSD symptoms at post-treatment. There was also a significant indirect effect from treatment to changes in stigma at post-treatment through changes in attitudes towards mental health treatment at mid-treatment, suggesting attitude change may occur first. Baseline characteristics did not moderate treatment's change in stigma or attitudes. Improvements in PTSD symptoms and positive changes in attitudes towards mental health treatment appear to separately predict later reductions in stigma.","['Reger, Greg M', 'Bourassa, Kyle', 'Norr, Aaron M', 'Buck, Benjamin']","['Reger GM', 'Bourassa K', 'Norr AM', 'Buck B']","['VA Puget Sound Health Care System, 9600 Veterans Drive, A-116, Tacoma, WA, 98493, United States; University of Washington School of Medicine, 1959 NE Pacific St, Box 356560, Seattle, WA, 98195-6560, United States.

We examined the prevalence of mental health disorders among a non-institutionalized, community sample of Black adults in the US from the National Survey of American Life. We compared the odds of mental health disorders between Black American adults with SCD and those with other medical conditions, or no medical condition. Among the SCD group, 38.8% reported at least one mental health disorder: 17.6% endorsed a mood disorder, 24.7% an anxiety disorder, 2.4% an eating disorder, and 11.8% a childhood disorder. Compared to those with other medical conditions, Black Americans with SCD had greater poverty, more children in the household, and were less likely to be married/cohabitating (all P < 0.05). Yet, Black Americans with SCD were not at greater odds of having a mental health disorder compared to those with other medical conditions. When compared to the group with no conditions, however, individuals with SCD had 2.57 greater odds of mood disorder (95% confidence interval: 1.43-4.65; P = 0.002). The effect remained when controlling for socioeconomic status, marital status, and perceived physical health. In this study, almost 40% of Black American adults with SCD presented with a mental health disorder. Prevalence of mental health disorders was similar among those with non-heritable medical conditions, but those without a medical condition had a lower prevalence than in SCD. Among Black Americans, there appear to be unmeasured factors, common across medical conditions, that are linked to mental health disorders.","['Jonassaint, Charles R', 'Lukombo, Ines', 'Feldman, Robert', 'Driscoll, Jordan', 'Eack, Shaun M', 'Abebe, Kaleab Z', 'De Castro, Laura']","['Jonassaint CR', 'Lukombo I', 'Feldman R', 'Driscoll J', 'Eack SM', 'Abebe KZ', 'De Castro L']","['School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Center for Research on Health Care, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Section of Benign Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Center for Research on Health Care, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Section of Benign Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'School of Social Work, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Center for Research on Health Care, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Section of Benign Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['K23HL135396/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R34MH125152/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20211203,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Black or African American', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/*psychology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*psychology', 'Mental Health', 'Prevalence']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic illness', 'depression; anxiety; healthcare disparities', 'hematology', 'mental health', 'minority health', 'mood disorders', 'sickle cell disease']",2021/12/04 06:00,2022/03/03 06:00,['2021/12/03 07:18'],"['2021/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/03 07:18 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17962 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2022 Feb;196(4):1059-1068. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17962.

There was no significant difference between study conditions for mental health outcomes or actual help-seeking among those with probable mental disorder at any time point. CONCLUSIONS: Workplace mental health awareness training has a limited short-term impact on likelihood of help-seeking and does not appear to improve mental health outcomes.","['Tan, Leona', 'Harvey, Samuel B', 'Deady, Mark', 'Dobson, Mark', 'Donohoe, Alison', 'Suk, Curie', 'Paterson, Helen', 'Bryant, Richard']","['Tan L', 'Harvey SB', 'Deady M', 'Dobson M', 'Donohoe A', 'Suk C', 'Paterson H', 'Bryant R']","['Black Dog Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia (Ms Tan, Dr Harvey, Dr Deady); School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia (Ms Tan); Fire and Rescue New South Wales (Mr Dobson, Mr Donohoe); School of Psychology, University of Sydney (Ms Suk, Dr Paterson); School of Psychology (Dr Bryant), University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Occup Environ Med,Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,9504688,IM,"['Humans', '*Mental Disorders/therapy', 'Mental Health', '*Workplace']",,,,,2020/12/23 06:00,2021/08/27 06:00,['2020/12/22 10:24'],"['2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/22 10:24 [entrez]']","['00043764-202104000-00007 [pii]', '10.1097/JOM.0000000000002121 [doi]']",ppublish,J Occup Environ Med. 2021 Apr 1;63(4):311-316. doi: 10.1097/JOM.0000000000002121.,4,,,"['Conflicts of Interests: The authors declare that they have no conflict of', 'interest relevant to this paper.

Many reports from all over the world have already found that HCWs have significant levels of self-reported anxiety, depression and even symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Therefore, supporting mental health of HCWs is a crucial part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the present review is to ascertain the interventions put in place worldwide in reducing stress in HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak. We evidenced how only few countries have published specific psychological support intervention protocols for HCWs. All programs were developed in university associated hospitals and highlighted the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration. All of them had as their purpose to manage the psychosocial challenges to HCW's during the pandemic in order to prevent mental health problems.Whether one program offers distinct benefit compared to the others cannot be known given the heterogeneity of the protocols and the lack of a rigorous protocol and clinical outcomes. Further research is crucial to find out the best ways to support the resilience and mental well-being of HCWs.","['Buselli, Rodolfo', 'Corsi, Martina', 'Veltri, Antonello', 'Baldanzi, Sigrid', 'Chiumiento, Martina', 'Lupo, Elena Del', 'Marino, Riccardo', 'Necciari, Gabriele', 'Caldi, Fabrizio', 'Foddis, Rudy', 'Guglielmi, Giovanni', 'Cristaudo, Alfonso']","['Buselli R', 'Corsi M', 'Veltri A', 'Baldanzi S', 'Chiumiento M', 'Lupo ED', 'Marino R', 'Necciari G', 'Caldi F', 'Foddis R', 'Guglielmi G', 'Cristaudo A']","['Occupational Health Department, U.O.

A total of 1875 participants were included from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, also known as the British 1946 birth cohort. The results indicated that higher childhood cognitive ability was associated with reporting fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression GHQ-28 scores in women, and increased risk of potential alcohol abuse in both men and women. Results were adjusted for educational attainment, early socioeconomic status (SES) and adverse circumstances, and adult SES, adverse circumstances, and negative health behaviours. After adjusting for childhood cognitive ability, greater educational attainment was associated with reporting greater symptoms of anxiety and depression on the GHQ-28. Although undoubtedly interrelated, our evidence on the diverging effects of childhood cognitive ability and educational attainment on anxiety and depression in mid-adulthood highlights the need for the two to be considered independently. While higher childhood cognitive ability is associated with fewer internalising symptoms of anxiety and depression in women, it places both men and women at higher risk for potential alcohol abuse. Further research is needed to examine possible psychosocial mechanisms that may be associated with both higher childhood cognitive ability and greater risk for alcohol abuse. In addition, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the gender-specific link between childhood cognitive ability and the risk of experiencing internalising disorders in mid-adulthood warrants further consideration.","['Hatch, Stephani L', 'Jones, Peter B', 'Kuh, Diana', 'Hardy, Rebecca', 'Wadsworth, Michael E J', 'Richards, Marcus']","['Hatch SL', 'Jones PB', 'Kuh D', 'Hardy R', 'Wadsworth ME', 'Richards M']","['Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. slh2020@columbia.edu']",['eng'],['MC_U120063239/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070329,England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,IM,"['Child', '*Child Development', 'Cognition/*physiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'United Kingdom']",PMC3504659,,,,2007/04/03 09:00,2007/07/11 09:00,['2007/04/03 09:00'],"['2007/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0277-9536(07)00076-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.02.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 2007 Jun;64(11):2285-96. doi: 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.02.027.

Commonly accepted conceptual or diagnostic criteria for eco-anxiety are currently lacking. Here, we briefly summarize the current literature on climate change and mental illness. We suggest dividing the concept of eco-anxiety into adaptive eco-anxiety and an anxiety disorder where climate change plays a major role. This distinction may be helpful in clinical practice to discern relatively common and potentially healthy eco-anxiety from a disorder causing impairment in daily functioning. Benefits of adaptive eco-anxiety include the development of active coping strategies (increasing resilience) as well as behavioural changes to mitigate climate change. When debilitating anxiety comes with avoidance and centers around climate change, a specific phobia called eco-anxiety disorder may be considered. Importantly, as validated diagnostic criteria for this disorder are currently lacking, further conceptualization is highly needed. Future clinical research may help fill these current knowledge gaps.","['Luykx, Jurjen J', 'Vinkers, Christiaan H', 'Tijdink, Joeri K']","['Luykx JJ', 'Vinkers CH', 'Tijdink JK']","['Maastrichts Universitair Medisch Centrum, afd.

RESULTS: In all European countries, a decreased trend of suicides was observed in the period 1980-2000, with the exception of Ireland and (partially) of Spain. In Ireland, the increased trend was particularly strong, with a high risk in young and adult males. Portugal and Greece had respectively the highest and the lowest rates of undetermined causes of death. Most countries that were high consumers of alcohol in the initial period of observation had a rate above the national mean until 1980, after which consumption decreased. Most nations that were low consumers in 1960 had rates below the mean until 1980,when the rates progressively increased. However, a general decrease of alcohol-related deaths was apparent in all countries. Mortality associated with mental disorder increased, most clearly during the mid 1980s. The number of psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 3.6 in Spain to 17.5 in Finland; of child psychiatrists, from 0.9 in Germany to 5.1 in Portugal. Psychiatric beds ranged from 0.4 per 1,000 inhabitants in Italy and Spain to 1.3 in Ireland. Nine countries showed a trend towards a reduction in psychiatric beds, whilst in a further five countries no change was observed. Rates of long-stay patients varied from 9.5 in the UK to 84 in Belgium, with a generally decreasing trend. The use of outpatient facilities differed markedly between countries, although there was a general increase over time. Official data were scarce in relation to the sale of psychotropic drugs. IMS data indicated increasing consumption in all European countries for antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. CONCLUSIONS: The official data resources available for European countries seem to indicate some discrepancies, probably relating to methods of recording. Better co-ordination in the collection of data about mental health status in the European Union and an improvement of the quality in available services is needed.","['Carta, Mauro G', 'Kovess, Viviane', 'Hardoy, Maria Carolina', 'Brugha, Traolagh', 'Fryers, Tom', 'Lehtinen, Ville', 'Xavier, Miguel']","['Carta MG', 'Kovess V', 'Hardoy MC', 'Brugha T', 'Fryers T', 'Lehtinen V', 'Xavier M']","['Psychiatric Unit, Dept. of Public Health, University of Cagliari, Via Liguria 13, 09127 Cagliari, Italy. mgcarta@tiscali.it']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,8804358,IM,"['Europe/epidemiology', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Holistic Health', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Mental Health Services/organization & administration/*statistics & numerical data', 'Psychology', 'Public Health Informatics', '*Self Concept', 'World Health Organization']",,,,,2004/11/19 09:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2004/11/19 09:00'],"['2004/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00127-004-0871-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol. 2004 Nov;39(11):883-92. doi: 10.1007/s00127-004-0871-0.,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The challenges facing new refugees during this 'transition period' can affect their mental health, but this has not been quantified. AIMS: To assess the impact of the transition period on new refugees' mental health in the 12 months after being granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom. METHOD: A longitudinal survey design was used to measure the mental health of 30 newly recognised refugees at monthly intervals in the first 6 months and again at 1 year after receiving leave to remain in the United Kingdom. There were five outcome measures for symptoms of anxiety, depression, distress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), post-migration living difficulties (PMLD) and a life events calendar to record key changes in housing and welfare. RESULTS: The results showed that the trajectory of scores across all measures fluctuates, but overall they all improve from baseline to Month 12. Scores for depression and PMLD showed significant improvement at Month 5, and scores for anxiety, depression, distress and PMLD showed significant improvement at Month 12. PTSD scores did not show significant improvement at any month. In months with a high number of stressful life events, participants had worse PMLD and PTSD scores. CONCLUSION: Overall improvement in mental health could partly be explained by the stability of being granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom, but may also be due to the high level of practical support these participants received. Recommendations are made for those working with clients during the transition period.","['Walker, Sophie', 'von Werthern, Martha', 'Brady, Francesca', 'Katona, Cornelius']","['Walker S', 'von Werthern M', 'Brady F', 'Katona C']","['Helen Bamber Foundation, London, UK.', 'Psychiatry, University of Oxford, UK.', 'Helen Bamber Foundation, London, UK.', 'Department of Mental Health Sciences, UCL, London, UK.', 'Helen Bamber Foundation, London, UK.', 'Woodfield Trauma Service, Central and North West London Mental Health NHS Trust, UK.', 'Helen Bamber Foundation, London, UK.', 'Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200720,England,Int J Soc Psychiatry,The International journal of social psychiatry,0374726,IM,"['Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Refugees', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic', '*Transients and Migrants', 'United Kingdom']",PMC8191167,,['NOTNLM'],"['Refugee', 'forced migration', 'mental health', 'transition period']",2020/07/21 06:00,2021/10/12 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1177_0020764020939610 [pii]', '10.1177/0020764020939610 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Soc Psychiatry. 2021 Mar;67(2):188-196. doi: 10.1177/0020764020939610.

Connected mental health (CMH), which refers to the use of information and communication technologies in mental health care, can assist in overcoming these barriers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic mapping study is to provide an overview and a structured understanding of CMH literature available in the Scopus database. METHODS: A total of 289 selected publications were analyzed based on 8 classification criteria: publication year, publication source, research type, contribution type, empirical type, mental health issues, targeted cohort groups, and countries where the empirically evaluated studies were conducted. RESULTS: The results showed that there was an increasing interest in CMH publications; journals were the main publication channels of the selected papers; exploratory research was the dominant research type; advantages and challenges of the use of technology for mental health care were the most investigated subjects; most of the selected studies had not been evaluated empirically; depression and anxiety were the most addressed mental disorders; young people were the most targeted cohort groups in the selected publications; and Australia, followed by the United States, was the country where most empirically evaluated studies were conducted. CONCLUSIONS: CMH is a promising research field to present novel approaches to assist in the management, treatment, and diagnosis of mental health issues that can help overcome existing mental health care delivery barriers. Future research should be shifted toward providing evidence-based studies to examine the effectiveness of CMH solutions and identify related issues.","['Drissi, Nidal', 'Ouhbi, Sofia', 'Janati Idrissi, Mohammed Abdou', 'Fernandez-Luque, Luis', 'Ghogho, Mounir']","['Drissi N', 'Ouhbi S', 'Janati Idrissi MA', 'Fernandez-Luque L', 'Ghogho M']","['Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.', 'National School For Computer Science, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Rabat, Morocco.', 'Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.', 'National School For Computer Science, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Rabat, Morocco.', 'Salumedia Labs, Seville, Spain.', 'Adhera Health Inc, Palo Alto, CA, United States.', 'TICLab, International University of Rabat, Rabat, Morocco.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200828,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,IM,"['Delivery of Health Care/*methods', 'Health Services Research/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*standards']",PMC7486675,,['NOTNLM'],"['connected health', 'eHealth', 'health informatics', 'information systems', 'information technology', 'interdisciplinary research', 'mHealth', 'mental health', 'mobile health', 'mobile phone', 'review', 'telehealth']",2020/08/29 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2020/08/29 06:00'],"['2020/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['v22i8e19950 [pii]', '10.2196/19950 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2020 Aug 28;22(8):e19950. doi: 10.2196/19950.,8,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9667-5931', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7614-9731', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3567-1483', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8165-9904', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0055-7867']",,"['Conflicts of Interest: LL is a shareholder of Salumedia Labs, which is a digital', 'health company.']","['(c)Nidal Drissi, Sofia Ouhbi, Mohammed Abdou Janati Idrissi, Luis Fernandez-Luque,', 'Mounir Ghogho.

Of all users, 25.3% were age 50-64 and 6.7% were age 65 + . Multivariable logistic regression results, controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, census region, and alcohol/substance use disorder, showed that compared to the 30-49 age group, the 50-64 and 65+ age groups had higher odds of having depressive disorder in outpatient-only settings; however, they had consistently higher odds of a diagnosis of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder in all three service settings. Along with advocating for increased funding for publicly-financed mental health services, social workers in public mental health service systems should ensure that they utilize effective intervention skills for older adults with serious mental illness.","['Choi, Namkee G', 'DiNitto, Diana M', 'Marti, C Nathan']","['Choi NG', 'DiNitto DM', 'Marti CN']","['Steve Hicks School of Social Work, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Steve Hicks School of Social Work, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Steve Hicks School of Social Work, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20221209,United States,Soc Work Health Care,Social work in health care,7603729,IM,"['Humans', 'Aged', 'Middle Aged', 'Adolescent', '*Mental Health Services', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology/therapy', 'Mental Health', '*Alcoholism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Public mental health services', 'anxiety disorder', 'depressive disorder', 'schizophrenia']",2022/12/10 06:00,2022/12/21 06:00,['2022/12/09 04:33'],"['2022/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2022/12/09 04:33 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00981389.2022.2154886 [doi]'],ppublish,Soc Work Health Care. 2022;61(9-10):499-515. doi: 10.1080/00981389.2022.2154886.

The continuing deinstitutionalisation process and the implementation of community mental health services was considerably affected by the reunification of East and West Germany in 1990, which required dramatic changes in the structure and quality of the mental health care system of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Overall, German mental health care is organised as a subsidiary system, where planning and regulating mental health care is the responsibility of the 16 federal states. So German mental health care provision is spread among many sectors and characterised by considerable regional differences. A key characteristic is the particularly wide gap between inpatient and outpatient services, which are funded separately and staffed by different teams. In 2003 the total number of psychiatric beds was a mere two thirds of the overall bed capacity in 1991, the first year as a re-unified Germany, when psychiatric beds in East and West Germany totalled 80,275. From 1970 onwards the number of psychiatric beds was cut by roughly half. So the momentum of the reform has been strong enough to assimilate the completely different mental health care system of the former German Democratic Republic and, in the course of a decade, to re-structure mental health services for an additional 17-18 million new inhabitants. In an ongoing struggle to adapt to changing administrative set-ups, legal frameworks, and financial constraints, psychiatry in Germany in currently facing specific problems and is seriously challenged to defend to considerable achievements of the past. A major obstacle to achieving this aim lies in the fragmented system of mental health care provision and mental health care funding.","['Salize, Hans Joachim', 'Rossler, Wulf', 'Becker, Thomas']","['Salize HJ', 'Rossler W', 'Becker T']","['Central Institute of Mental Health, 68159 Mannheim, Germany. salize@zi-mannheim.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci,European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,9103030,IM,"['Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology/therapy', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Mental Health Services/*statistics & numerical data/*trends']",,,,,2006/12/07 09:00,2007/08/04 09:00,['2006/12/07 09:00'],"['2006/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00406-006-0696-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci. 2007 Mar;257(2):92-103. doi: 10.1007/s00406-006-0696-9.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,60,,,,,,,,,,

Minority stress theory and the psychological mediation framework have become the predominant conceptual models used to explain these disparities, and they have led to substantial advances in research on stigma-related stress and mental health. However, the field's reliance on these models has limited the extent to which other theories have been considered as potential frameworks for further advancing our understanding of sexual minority mental health. In this article, I discuss how the rejection sensitivity (RS) model can be used to complement and extend minority stress theory and the psychological mediation framework by: (1) emphasizing the role of perception in stigma-related experiences; (2) acknowledging the unique consequences of different anticipatory emotions; (3) describing additional mechanisms linking proximal minority stressors to mental health; and (4) further specifying the temporal order of these processes.

The objective is to gain insights into the emerging applications of VR/AR in mental health interventions and their potential impact on patient outcomes. The review also includes personal observations on the effectiveness and challenges associated with VR/AR simulations and the rise of exciting, disruptive artificial intelligence large language models. The findings of this review contribute to the understanding of the current state of VR/AR technology in mental health and highlight potential future directions in this rapidly evolving field. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown that VR/AR simulation is an effective and promising approach for treating various anxiety disorders, including specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Simulated environments can be tailored to induce provoking situations, allowing individuals to learn from and gradually confront and grow in controlled and safe environments. Recent findings in the field of virtual reality simulations in mental health indicate that VR/AR exposure therapy is effective for treating anxiety disorders, while interventions show promise in improving social skills in individuals working with patients. In a broader sense, the use of VR/AR as an educational tool shows enormous potential now that functional generative artificial intelligence (AI) is recently available.","['Carlson, Clint G']",['Carlson CG'],"['Fitzsimons Building, University of Colorado, School of Medicine, 13001 East 17Th Place, Room E1354, Campus Box C290, CO, 80045, Aurora, USA. clint.carlson@cuanschutz.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20230825,United States,Curr Psychiatry Rep,Current psychiatry reports,100888960,IM,"['Humans', '*Artificial Intelligence', 'Mental Health', 'Anxiety Disorders/therapy', 'Language', '*Phobia, Social']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Artificial intelligence', 'Augmented reality', 'Avatars', 'Extended reality', 'Generative AI', 'Large language models', 'Simulation', 'Virtual reality']",2023/08/25 12:42,2023/09/19 06:43,['2023/08/25 11:09'],"['2023/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/09/19 06:43 [medline]', '2023/08/25 12:42 [pubmed]', '2023/08/25 11:09 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11920-023-01438-4 [pii]', '10.1007/s11920-023-01438-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Psychiatry Rep. 2023 Sep;25(9):365-371. doi: 10.1007/s11920-023-01438-4.

AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between job stress, thinking style and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) of mental health nurses, and to explore the mechanism of job stress and thinking style on symptoms of PTSD. METHOD: This cross-sectional study collected related data of 351 mental health nurses in China, and the data was analyzed by PROCESS macro for SPSS. RESULTS: The results showed that 18.2% of mental health nurses had the symptoms of PTSD. Thinking style (monarchic thinking style, anarchic thinking style and external thinking style) played a moderating role in the predictive effects of job stress on the symptoms of PTSD. DISCUSSION: The research pointed out the relationship between job stress and symptom of PTSD, and clarified the critical role of thinking style among mental health nurses. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is recommended that organizations should enact effective policy and intervention programs to reduce job stress and PTSD symptoms of mental health nurses which may improve their mental health level.","['Liu, Wuyi', 'Sun, Lin', 'Yin, Xunbao', 'Zhao, Huan', 'Zhu, Guohui', 'Lian, Bo', 'Sun, Hongwei']","['Liu W', 'Sun L', 'Yin X', 'Zhao H', 'Zhu G', 'Lian B', 'Sun H']","['School of Public Health, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.', 'School of Psychology, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.', 'School of Teacher Education, Weifang University, Weifang, China.', 'School of Psychology, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.', 'Depression Treatment Center, Weifang Mental Health Center, Weifang, China.', 'School of Biological Sciences and Technology, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.', 'School of Psychology, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20220915,Switzerland,Front Public Health,Frontiers in public health,101616579,IM,"['Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Nurses', '*Occupational Stress', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic']",PMC9521599,,['NOTNLM'],"['job stress', 'mental health nurses', 'moderation model', 'post-traumatic stress disorder', 'thinking style']",2022/10/04 06:00,2022/10/05 06:00,['2022/10/03 04:56'],"['2022/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2022/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/10/03 04:56 [entrez]', '2022/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fpubh.2022.979138 [doi]'],epublish,Front Public Health. 2022 Sep 15;10:979138. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2022.979138. eCollection 2022.,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']","['Copyright (c) 2022 Liu, Sun, Yin, Zhao, Zhu, Lian and Sun.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While studies have shown that self-reported mental health conditions such as stress, anxiety and depression are associated with job satisfaction, a large population-based study exploring and comparing self-reported physician posed diagnosed conditions and their association with job satisfaction and job tenure is missing. This study addresses the gap along with exploring the impact of the neurotic personality trait and other possible contributing factors. METHODS: Sixteen mental health disorders diagnosed by physicians, categorised into four major groups were investigated in relation to employment status (108,711 participants) and in relation to job satisfaction and job tenure (34,808 participants). Analyses were performed using linear regression adjusted for age, sex, townsend deprivation index, body mass index, education, physical activity, work hours and neuroticism. RESULTS: Neurotic and stress disorders, eating disorders and other mental health disorders were strongly associated with lower job satisfaction and shorter job tenure in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Neuroticism was strongly linked to job satisfaction but was not associated with job tenure. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings clarify the complex relationship of mental health with job satisfaction and job tenure, which is very important to understand in designing measures to improve working life participation of individuals with mental health issues.","['Mohammad, Salahuddin', 'Miguet, Maud', 'Rukh, Gull', 'Schioth, Helgi B', 'Mwinyi, Jessica']","['Mohammad S', 'Miguet M', 'Rukh G', 'Schioth HB', 'Mwinyi J']","['Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University, Sweden.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University, Sweden.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University, Sweden.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University, Sweden.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['MC_PC_17228/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_QA137853/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",['Journal Article'],20220825,Sweden,Scand J Public Health,Scandinavian journal of public health,100883503,IM,"['Humans', '*Job Satisfaction', 'Mental Health', 'Cohort Studies', 'Biological Specimen Banks', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology/psychology', 'United Kingdom']",PMC10642223,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anxiety', 'depression', 'eating disorder', 'employment', 'job satisfaction', 'job tenure', 'mental illness', 'mood disorder', 'neuroticism', 'occupation', 'schizophrenia', 'stress disorder']",2022/08/27 06:00,2023/11/13 06:42,['2022/08/26 01:50'],"['2023/11/13 06:42 [medline]', '2022/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/08/26 01:50 [entrez]']","['10.1177_14034948221119639 [pii]', '10.1177/14034948221119639 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Public Health. 2023 Dec;51(8):1248-1257. doi: 10.1177/14034948221119639.

Major depression, impairment in daily activities due to pain, poor self-reported health, and declining health were described for refugees who had and had not reported persecution prior to arrival in the U.S. Health status was also examined for refugees who reported different forms of persecution. Half of refugees (46.7 %) in this sample reported that they or an immediate family member had been persecuted. One in three persecuted refugees (31.8 %) reported both incarceration and physical punishment. Major depression, pain-related impairment, poor health, and declining health were twice as common among persecuted refugees than among non persecuted refugees. Notably, despite these adverse experiences, the majority of persecuted refugees did not report poor health outcomes.","['Yun, Katherine', 'Mohamad, Zeinab', 'Kiss, Ligia', 'Annamalai, Aniyizhai', 'Zimmerman, Cathy']","['Yun K', 'Mohamad Z', 'Kiss L', 'Annamalai A', 'Zimmerman C']","[""PolicyLab, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA. yunk@email.chop.edu."", ""PolicyLab, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Healthcare Analytics Unit, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'Gender, Violence and Health Centre, Department of Global Health and Development, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.

Records of miracles that were believed to have been performed by saints reveal details of illnesses and injuries that afflicted medieval people. In the twelfth century, such records became increasingly medicalized and naturalized as the monks who recorded them gained access to Greek and Arabic medical material, newly translated into Latin. Nonetheless, by exploring nuances and patterns across the cults of five English saints, this book shows that hagiographical representations of madness were shaped as much by the individual circumstances of their recording as they were by new medical and theological standards.","['Trenery, Claire']",['Trenery C'],"['Queen Mary University of London, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190731,England,Hist Psychiatry,History of psychiatry,9013819,,"['England', 'Epilepsy/history', 'History, Medieval', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*history', 'Mental Health/history', '*Religion and Medicine', 'Saints/*history']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hagiography', 'history of medicine', 'madness', 'medieval medicine', 'mental health', 'mind', 'miracles', 'saints']",2019/08/01 06:00,2020/05/01 06:00,['2019/08/01 06:00'],"['2019/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0957154X19866593 [doi]'],ppublish,Hist Psychiatry. 2019 Dec;30(4):480-488. doi: 10.1177/0957154X19866593.

METHODS: We used regression modeling, an interaction test, and complex survey design adjustments to estimate prevalences and test potential relationships between previous violent events and mental health. RESULTS: Many (20.6%) participants experienced at least 1 previous serious violent event. Witnessing someone severely injured or killed was the most common event. Depression was experienced by 4.2% of participants, with 6.5% experiencing anxiety, 6.4% an alcohol-related disorder, and 1.9% posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persons who experienced violence during the war had 4.3 times the adjusted odds of alcohol-related disorders (P < .05) and 4.0 times the adjusted odds of PTSD (P < .05) compared with the postwar period. Women, indigenous Maya, and urban dwellers had greater odds of experiencing postviolence mental health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Violence that began during the civil war and continues today has had a significant effect on the mental health of Guatemalans. However, mental health outcomes resulting from violent events decreased in the postwar period, suggesting a nation in recovery.","['Puac-Polanco, Victor D', 'Lopez-Soto, Victor A', 'Kohn, Robert', 'Xie, Dawei', 'Richmond, Therese S', 'Branas, Charles C']","['Puac-Polanco VD', 'Lopez-Soto VA', 'Kohn R', 'Xie D', 'Richmond TS', 'Branas CC']","['Victor D.

We evaluated studies on e-mental health for PDs published over the last 3 years (2019-2022). RECENT FINDINGS: Studies published in English that used e-mental health to treat people with PDs or PD-related symptoms were identified. We identified 19 studies, including four randomized controlled trials and one meta-analysis. Most interventions were based on Dialectical Behavior Therapy and delivered through smartphone applications for adults with Borderline Personality Disorder [BPD] or related symptoms.

METHODS: Using the 2000-2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, households having individuals with mental health disorders were identified. The SF-12 and EQ-5D surveys were used to acquire utility and health status scores for household members. The outcomes in households including an individual with a mental health disorder were compared to those of the control group (absence of individuals with mental health disorders in the household). We also compared a total of 15 pairs of diseases based on the SF-6D scores. A beta generalized estimating equation model was employed. RESULTS: Average scores of utility and health status among individuals living with a member with a mental health disorder in the household were statistically lower than those of the control group and; for the SF-6D, met the minimally important difference for SUD, schizophrenia, and dementia. Differences in the SF-6D scores were statistically significant for 5 pairs of the mental health disorders: EMD-anxiety, EMD-ADHD, dementia-anxiety, dementia-ADHD, and schizophrenia-ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of family spillover effects in mental illness using both utility and health status measures from a US representative sample. Integrating this evidence into clinical and policy decision making as well as economic evaluations would allow for a more comprehensive valuation of the societal benefits of mental and behavioral health interventions.","['Lee, Donghoon', 'Kim, Yeonil', 'Devine, Beth']","['Lee D', 'Kim Y', 'Devine B']","['Department of Health Systems and Population Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Merck Research Laboratories, Merck & Co Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Health Systems and Population Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'The Comparative Health Outcomes, Policy, and Economics (CHOICE) Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210811,United States,Med Decis Making,Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,8109073,IM,"['Family', 'Humans', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology', 'Mental Health', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['beta regression', 'cost-effectiveness analysis', 'health-related quality of life', 'marginal model']",2021/08/12 06:00,2022/02/01 06:00,['2021/08/11 08:45'],"['2021/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/02/01 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/11 08:45 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0272989X211027146 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Decis Making. 2022 Jan;42(1):80-93. doi: 10.1177/0272989X211027146.

This study addresses this gap by investigating the association of MDE and flourishing mental health (FMH) with chronological age and subjective (felt and ideal) age. Data are from the Midlife in the United States random digit dialing sample of adults ages 25 to 74, collected in 1995 (n = 3032). Rates of MDE were lowest, and FMH highest, among the three oldest age cohorts (45-54, 55-64, 65-74 years). Subjective age was linked with chronological age; with age, adults tend to feel younger, and want to be an age that is younger, than their actual age. As predicted by the model of subjective age as an adaptive strategy, feeling younger was related to a lower risk of MDE and a higher risk of FMH. However, wanting to be younger was related to a lower risk of FMH and unrelated to MDE.","['Keyes, Corey L M', 'Westerhof, Gerben J']","['Keyes CL', 'Westerhof GJ']","['Department of Sociology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA. ckeyes@emory.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110725,England,Aging Ment Health,Aging & mental health,9705773,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aging/*psychology', 'Depressive Disorder, Major/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Self Concept', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,,2011/07/26 06:00,2012/04/24 06:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/13607863.2011.596811 [doi]'],ppublish,Aging Ment Health. 2012;16(1):67-74. doi: 10.1080/13607863.2011.596811.

However, empirical evidence of this pattern has been elusive, perhaps owing to a heavy reliance on singular measures that fail to distinguish between plural, often competing internal motivations for punishment. The present study employed a test of the theorized double-edge pattern using a novel approach designed to separate such motivations. We asked a large sample of participants (N = 330) to render criminal sentencing judgments under varying conditions of the defendant's mental health status (Healthy, Neurobiological Disorder, Psychological Disorder) and the disorder's treatability (Treatable, Untreatable). As predicted, neurobiological evidence simultaneously elicited shorter prison sentences (i.e., mitigating) and longer terms of involuntary hospitalization (i.e., aggravating) than equivalent psychological evidence. However, these effects were not well explained by motivations to restore treatable defendants to health or to protect society from dangerous persons but instead by deontological motivations pertaining to the defendant's level of deservingness and possible obligation to provide medical care. This is the first study of its kind to quantitatively demonstrate the paradoxical effect of neuroscientific trial evidence and raises implications for how such evidence is presented and evaluated.","['Allen, Corey H', 'Vold, Karina', 'Felsen, Gidon', 'Blumenthal-Barby, Jennifer S', 'Aharoni, Eyal']","['Allen CH', 'Vold K', 'Felsen G', 'Blumenthal-Barby JS', 'Aharoni E']","['Neuroscience Institute, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Faculty of Philosophy, Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.', 'Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Neuroscience Institute, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Psychology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Philosophy, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190118,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Criminals/*psychology', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', '*Judgment', 'Male', 'Mental Health', '*Neurobiology', 'Prisons', 'Punishment/*psychology', 'Regression Analysis']",PMC6338372,,,,2019/01/19 06:00,2019/10/17 06:00,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-18-33409 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0210584 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jan 18;14(1):e0210584. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0210584. eCollection 2019.,1,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3544-1247'],,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the prevalence of 12 common mental disorders, the proportion of adults who screened positive for any disorder, the sociodemographic factors associated with meeting criteria for a disorder and the associations between each disorder and history of attempted suicide. METHODS: A non-probability nationally representative sample (N = 1110) of adults living in Ireland completed self-report measures of 12 mental health disorders. Effect sizes were calculated using odds ratios from logistic regression models, and population attributable risk fractions (PAFs) were estimated to quantify the associations between each disorder and attempted suicide. RESULTS: Prevalence rates ranged from 15.0% (insomnia disorder) to 1.7% (histrionic personality disorder). Overall, 42.5% of the sample met criteria for a mental health disorder, and 11.1% had a lifetime history of attempted suicide. Younger age, being a shift worker and trauma exposure were independently associated with a higher likelihood of having a mental health disorder, while being in university was associated with a lower likelihood of having a disorder. ICD-11 complex posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder and insomnia disorder had the highest PAFs for attempted suicide.

METHODS: The study was a representative community cross-sectional cohort self-report survey, carried out in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury registered on the Victorian Spinal Cord Injury Register and adults with non-traumatic spinal cord injury attending a specialist non-traumatic spinal cord injury rehabilitation clinic. Participants (n=443) completed a self-report survey by internet, telephone or hard copy, which used reliable and valid measures of depression, anxiety and stress (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale) and post-traumatic stress disorder (Impact of Events Scale-Revised). RESULTS: Nearly half (48.5%) of the population with spinal cord injury suffered mental health problems of depression (37%), anxiety (30%), clinical-level stress (25%) or post-traumatic stress disorder (8.4%). Overall, there was a twofold or more increase in the probability of emotional disorders compared to the general population. Of those with one mental health disorder, 60% also had at least one other emotional disorder, representing a substantial 56% increase over the general population in the probability of comorbidity of psychopathology. Better health and time since injury were associated with decreasing the risk of psychopathology. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study underscore the vulnerability of the population with spinal cord injury to emotional disorders. This study highlights the complexity of mental health problems experienced by many individuals with spinal cord injury living in the community. The delivery of mental health services to this vulnerable population requires recognition of comorbidity and problems of mobility, access and stigma.","['Migliorini, Christine', 'Tonge, Bruce', 'Taleporos, George']","['Migliorini C', 'Tonge B', 'Taleporos G']","['Monash University Centre for Developmental Psychology and Psychiatry, Monash Medical Centre, Clayton, Vic., Australia. christine.migliorini@med.monash.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Aust N Z J Psychiatry,The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,0111052,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/*psychology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Self Disclosure', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/*epidemiology/*psychology']",,,,,2008/03/12 09:00,2008/08/13 09:00,['2008/03/12 09:00'],"['2008/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['791367718 [pii]', '10.1080/00048670801886080 [doi]']",ppublish,Aust N Z J Psychiatry. 2008 Apr;42(4):309-14. doi: 10.1080/00048670801886080.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We compared characteristics of 116 youth with type 1 diabetes and 73,508 youth without type 1 diabetes from the same population-based sample of adolescents aged 12-17years, taken from the Brazilian Study of Cardiovascular Risk in Adolescents (ERICA). We evaluated the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) score, which is a self-administered screening survey for detecting mental health symptoms. Scores >/=3 were used to determine common mental disorder. RESULTS: Adolescents with and without type 1 diabetes were comparable with respect to age and race/ethnicity distributions. Youth with type 1 diabetes did not report higher scores on the weighted GHQ analyses in comparison to youth without type 1 diabetes (3.16, SE 0.76 vs. 2.10, SE 0.03, respectively; P = .167). No differences were found regarding the odds of having a GHQ score >/=3 (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.72-3.08). However, analyses of mental health symptoms separately consistently showed that youth with type 1 diabetes more frequently endorsed mental health barriers in comparison to youth without type 1 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health symptoms seem to be more frequent than diagnosis of common mental disorders in adolescents with type 1 diabetes, which may also interfere in glycemic control. Our findings highlight the need for appropriate mental health assessment in diabetes care in order to prevent glycemic control deterioration.","['Telo, Gabriela H', 'Cureau, Felipe V', 'Lopes, Claudia S', 'Schaan, Beatriz D']","['Telo GH', 'Cureau FV', 'Lopes CS', 'Schaan BD']","['Postgraduate Program in Endocrinology, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.

Unlike the United States, there is no legislation for clinical research in the UK to mandate the inclusion of ethnic minorities and they are underrepresented in European trials compared with those conducted in the United States. This restricts generalization of research findings. This systematic review of the barriers to the recruitment of ethnic minority participants into psychiatric research is based on a comprehensive literature search. Nine included papers explore such barriers based on the authors' and participants' experiences of research. These barriers are mainly categorized as: participant related, practical issues, family/community related, health service related and research process issues. This review provides a compilation of important barriers to recruitment which can facilitate future research. The barriers that were identified are not all unique to participants from ethnic minorities, although the way in which they manifest themselves is often distinct in minority groups. It is important that these barriers are considered when designing research design so that solutions to overcome such obstacles can be incorporated in research protocols from the start and appropriate resources allocated.","['Brown, Gillian', 'Marshall, Max', 'Bower, Peter', 'Woodham, Adrine', 'Waheed, Waquas']","['Brown G', 'Marshall M', 'Bower P', 'Woodham A', 'Waheed W']","['Division of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['G0800792/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/K025635/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20140128,United States,Int J Methods Psychiatr Res,International journal of methods in psychiatric research,9111433,IM,"['Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*therapy', 'Mental Health/*ethnology', 'Minority Groups', '*Patient Selection', '*Research Design']",PMC6878438,,['NOTNLM'],"['barriers', 'ethnic minorities', 'mental health research', 'recruitment', 'systematic review']",2014/01/30 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/01/30 06:00'],"['2012/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['MPR1434 [pii]', '10.1002/mpr.1434 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Methods Psychiatr Res. 2014 Mar;23(1):36-48. doi: 10.1002/mpr.1434.

METHODS: A cohort of firefighters was established among those deployed to a devastating wildfire in Alberta, Canada in May 2016. Firefighters completed three questionnaires: at recruitment giving details of exposures, a first follow-up reporting mental health supports before, during, and after the fire and a second follow-up, at least 30 months after the fire, with screening questionnaires for anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Fire chiefs were interviewed about mental health provisions. The impact of supports on mental ill health was estimated, adjusting for clustering within fire service and potential confounders. RESULTS: Of 1234 firefighters in the cohort, 840 completed the questionnaire on mental health supports. In total, 78 of 82 fire chiefs were interviewed. Analysis of the impact of supports on mental ill health included 745 firefighters from 67 fire services. Only 45.8% of reports of peer support were concordant between firefighters and fire chiefs. After adjusting for confounding, the odds ratios (OR) for peer support reported by both fire chief and firefighter were depressive disorder: OR = 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.08-0.61; anxiety disorder: OR = 0.45, 95% CI, 0.24-0.82; PTSD: OR = 0.62, 95% CI, 0.37-1.02. Symptoms of anxiety and depression but not PTSD were reduced by resiliency training before the fire and by support offered within 48 h of return from deployment. CONCLUSION: The results suggest peer support in firefighters is protective but its availability is poorly recognized. PTSD was somewhat less responsive, perhaps reflecting the cumulative effects of previous exposures.","['Cherry, Nicola', 'Galarneau, Jean-Michel', 'Haynes, Whitney', 'Sluggett, Bryan']","['Cherry N', 'Galarneau JM', 'Haynes W', 'Sluggett B']","['Division of Preventive Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Division of Preventive Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Division of Preventive Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Division of Preventive Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['381072/CIHR/Canada', '410992/CIHR/Canada']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210504,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,IM,"['Alberta', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Cohort Studies', '*Firefighters', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic']",PMC8252071,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fort McMurray fire', 'PTSD', 'firefighters', 'intervention', 'mental ill health', 'peer support']",2021/05/05 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/05/04 12:45'],"['2021/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/04 12:45 [entrez]']","['AJIM23249 [pii]', '10.1002/ajim.23249 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2021 Jul;64(7):593-601. doi: 10.1002/ajim.23249.

For those with mental disorders, SNSs can also be used to seek advice on mental health issues. One available SNS is Reddit, in which users can freely discuss such matters on relevant health diagnostic subreddits. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we analyzed the distinctive linguistic characteristics in users' posts on specific mental disorder subreddits (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and mental health) and further validated their distinctiveness externally by comparing them with posts of subreddits not related to mental illness. We also confirmed that these differences in linguistic formulations can be learned through a machine learning process. METHODS: Reddit posts uploaded by users were collected for our research. We used various statistical analysis methods in Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software, including 1-way ANOVA and subsequent post hoc tests, to see sentiment differences in various lexical features within mental health-related subreddits and against unrelated ones. We also applied 3 supervised and unsupervised clustering methods for both cases after extracting textual features from posts on each subreddit using bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to ensure that our data set is suitable for further machine learning or deep learning tasks. RESULTS: We collected 3,133,509 posts of 919,722 Reddit users. The results using the data indicated that there are notable linguistic differences among the subreddits, consistent with the findings of prior research. The findings from LIWC analyses revealed that patients with each mental health issue show significantly different lexical and semantic patterns, such as word count or emotion, throughout their online social networking activities, with P<.001 for all cases. Furthermore, distinctive features of each subreddit group were successfully identified through supervised and unsupervised clustering methods, using the BERT embeddings extracted from textual posts. This distinctiveness was reflected in the Davies-Bouldin scores ranging from 0.222 to 0.397 and the silhouette scores ranging from 0.639 to 0.803 in the former case, with scores of 1.638 and 0.729, respectively, in the latter case. CONCLUSIONS: By taking a multifaceted approach, analyzing textual posts related to mental health issues using statistical, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques, our approach provides insights into aspects of recent lexical usage and information about the linguistic characteristics of patients with specific mental health issues, which can inform clinicians about patients' mental health in diagnostic terms to aid online intervention. Our findings can further promote research areas involving linguistic analysis and machine learning approaches for patients with mental health issues by identifying and detecting mentally vulnerable groups of people online.","['Kim, Seoyun', 'Cha, Junyeop', 'Kim, Dongjae', 'Park, Eunil']","['Kim S', 'Cha J', 'Kim D', 'Park E']","['Department of Applied Artificial Intelligence, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Applied Artificial Intelligence, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Applied Artificial Intelligence, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Applied Artificial Intelligence, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Teach Company, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20231130,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,IM,"['Humans', '*Mental Health', 'Social Work', 'Social Networking', 'Anxiety', '*Online Social Networking']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['NLP', 'clustering', 'mental disorder', 'mental health', 'natural language processing', 'sentiment analysis', 'text analysis']",2023/11/30 12:41,2023/12/01 06:44,['2023/11/30 11:54'],"['2023/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2023/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2023/12/01 06:44 [medline]', '2023/11/30 12:41 [pubmed]', '2023/11/30 11:54 [entrez]']","['v25i1e49074 [pii]', '10.2196/49074 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2023 Nov 30;25:e49074. doi: 10.2196/49074.,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5740-897X', 'ORCID: 0009-0005-5153-9668', 'ORCID: 0009-0004-4784-2421', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3177-3538']",,,"['(c)Seoyun Kim, Junyeop Cha, Dongjae Kim, Eunil Park.

This disorder is typically accompanied by co-occurring disorders and conditions (e.g., mood, anxiety, psychosis, and substance use disorders). This complicated presentation of diverse symptoms makes the process of screening, assessing, and diagnosing FASD very difficult, limiting the likelihood that clients receive the treatment and services that they need. Although mental health care providers have an opportunity to intervene on behalf of clients with FASD, professionals may not be very familiar or comfortable with this complicated and life-altering disorder. The present study explores the familiarity of 79 mental health outpatient treatment professionals' personal knowledge and training about FASD.

These changes may have an important impact on the early detection and timely treatment of mental health conditions and risky behavior. Therefore, the objective was to extend our understanding of how these developmental changes in adolescent disclosure might impact adolescent mental health interviews. Specifically, we estimated the effects of third party presence and type of third party presence (adult, child, or both) on adolescents' reports of psychiatric symptoms, substance use, suicidal behavior, and childhood adversity. In this representative sample of 3005 adolescents from Mexico City (52.1 % female), administered the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI-A), adult presence influenced reporting the most; in their presence, adolescents reported more ADHD, parental mental illness and economic adversity, but less panic disorder, PTSD, drug use and disorder, and suicidal behavior. The presence of children was associated with increased odds of reporting conduct disorder, opportunity for drug use, parental criminal behavior, neglect, and the death of a parent. While adolescent information management strategies are normative and even desirable as a means of gaining emotional autonomy, they may also interfere with timely detection and treatment or intervention for mental health conditions and risky behaviors. Research and practical implications of these findings are discussed.","['Herrera, Aubrey V', 'Benjet, Corina', 'Mendez, Enrique', 'Casanova, Leticia', 'Medina-Mora, Maria Elena']","['Herrera AV', 'Benjet C', 'Mendez E', 'Casanova L', 'Medina-Mora ME']","['Direccion de Investigaciones Epidemiologicas y Psicosociales, Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria Ramon de la Fuente, Calzada Mexico-Xochimilco 101, San Lorenzo Huipulco, 14400, Mexico, D.F., Mexico.', 'Direccion de Investigaciones Epidemiologicas y Psicosociales, Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria Ramon de la Fuente, Calzada Mexico-Xochimilco 101, San Lorenzo Huipulco, 14400, Mexico, D.F., Mexico. cbenjet@imp.edu.mx.', 'Direccion de Investigaciones Epidemiologicas y Psicosociales, Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria Ramon de la Fuente, Calzada Mexico-Xochimilco 101, San Lorenzo Huipulco, 14400, Mexico, D.F., Mexico.', 'Direccion de Investigaciones Epidemiologicas y Psicosociales, Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria Ramon de la Fuente, Calzada Mexico-Xochimilco 101, San Lorenzo Huipulco, 14400, Mexico, D.F., Mexico.', 'Direccion de Investigaciones Epidemiologicas y Psicosociales, Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria Ramon de la Fuente, Calzada Mexico-Xochimilco 101, San Lorenzo Huipulco, 14400, Mexico, D.F., Mexico.']",['eng'],"['D43 TW000640/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'T37 MD001452/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20160120,United States,J Youth Adolesc,Journal of youth and adolescence,0333507,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior/*psychology', 'Adult', '*Disclosure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interview, Psychological/*methods', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Mexico', 'Parents', '*Psychology, Adolescent', 'Risk-Taking']",PMC5241249,['NIHMS833949'],['NOTNLM'],"['Adolescence', 'Information management', 'Mental health', 'Mexico', 'Privacy', 'Social desirability']",2016/01/23 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2016/01/22 06:00'],"['2015/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/01/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10964-016-0418-1 [pii]', '10.1007/s10964-016-0418-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Youth Adolesc. 2017 Feb;46(2):417-428. doi: 10.1007/s10964-016-0418-1.

Consequently, a systematic review of utilities or preferences for health states in the Spanish population was conducted. The results related to mental health are reported. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted. The main databases searched were MEDLINE, CRD, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane. The search strategy combined terms related to utilities and Spain. The inclusion criteria comprised the resident population in Spain, whether affected by any disease or not; the reported utilities had to be evaluated through a tool validated in Spain (i.e., EQ-5D, HUI, SF-6D) and/or following accepted techniques (e.g., time trade-off, standard gamble, or the visual analog scale). A narrative synthesis of articles was undertaken and the results related to mental health summarized. RESULTS: A total of 103 articles were finally included, from which 742 utility values were extracted. Sixty-nine utility values related to mental health and behavioral disorders were extracted from 12 studies. The most widely used tool was the E5-QD questionnaire. Most of the excluded articles evaluated quality of life but did not provide an estimation of utilities. CONCLUSIONS: This review adds value to research on utilities in Spain by gathering values to be included in economic evaluations, as well as by identifying research gaps in this field. The utility values related to mental health identified in this study are similar to those reported in international publications.","['Garcia-Perez, Lidia', 'Aguiar-Ibanez, Raquel', 'Pinilla-Dominguez, Pilar', 'Arvelo-Martin, Alejandro', 'Linertova, Renata', 'Rivero-Santana, Amado']","['Garcia-Perez L', 'Aguiar-Ibanez R', 'Pinilla-Dominguez P', 'Arvelo-Martin A', 'Linertova R', 'Rivero-Santana A']","['Servicio de Evaluacion del Servicio Canario de la Salud (SESCS), Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Espana; Fundacion Canaria de Investigacion y Salud (FUNCIS), Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Espana; Red de Investigacion en Servicios de Salud en Enfermedades Cronicas (REDISSEC), Espana.

However, with rapid urbanization across the globe, there is an urgent need to study this association and understand the potential impact of vegetation loss on the mental well-being of urban residents. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the spatial association between vegetation cover and the age- and sex-stratified mental health disorder cases in the neighborhoods of Toronto, Canada. METHODS: We used remote sensing to detect urban vegetation and Bayesian spatial hierarchical modeling to analyze the relationship between vegetation cover and mental health disorder cases. Specifically, an Enhanced Vegetation Index was used to detect urban vegetation, and Bayesian Poisson lognormal models were implemented to study the association between vegetation and mental health disorder cases of males and females in the 0-19, 20-44, 45-64, and >/=65 years age groups, after controlling for marginalization and unmeasured (latent) spatial and nonspatial covariates at the neighborhood level. RESULTS: The results suggest that even after adjusting for marginalization, there were significant age- and sex-specific effects of vegetation on the prevalence of mental health disorders in Toronto. Mental health disorders were negatively associated with the vegetation cover for males aged 0-19 years (-7.009; 95% CI -13.130 to -0.980) and for both males (-4.544; 95% CI -8.224 to -0.895) and females (-3.513; 95% CI -6.289 to -0.681) aged 20-44 years. However, for older adults in the 45-64 and >/=65 years age groups, only the marginalization covariates were significantly associated with mental health disorder cases. In addition, a substantial influence of the unmeasured (latent) and spatially structured covariates was detected in each model (relative contributions>0.7), suggesting that the variations in area-specific relative risk were mainly spatial in nature. CONCLUSIONS: As significant and negative associations between vegetation and mental health disorder cases were found for young males and females, investments in urban greenery can help reduce the future burden of mental health disorders in Canada. The findings highlight the urgent need to understand the age-sex dynamics of the interaction between surrounding vegetation and urban dwellers and its subsequent impact on mental well-being.","['Abdullah, Abu Yousuf Md', 'Law, Jane', 'Perlman, Christopher M', 'Butt, Zahid A']","['Abdullah AYM', 'Law J', 'Perlman CM', 'Butt ZA']","['School of Planning, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.', 'School of Public Health Sciences, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.', 'School of Planning, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.', 'School of Public Health Sciences, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.', 'School of Public Health Sciences, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.', 'School of Public Health Sciences, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20220728,Canada,JMIR Public Health Surveill,JMIR public health and surveillance,101669345,IM,"['Aged', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology', '*Mental Health', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Urbanization']",PMC9377430,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bayesian', 'Enhanced Vegetation Index', 'age- and sex- specific association', 'hierarchical modeling', 'latent covariates', 'marginalization', 'mental health disorders', 'spatial', 'vegetation cover']",2022/07/29 06:00,2022/08/02 06:00,['2022/07/28 11:53'],"['2021/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2022/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2022/07/28 11:53 [entrez]', '2022/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['v8i7e34782 [pii]', '10.2196/34782 [doi]']",epublish,JMIR Public Health Surveill. 2022 Jul 28;8(7):e34782. doi: 10.2196/34782.,7,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8641-990X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6259-9037', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7952-4952', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2486-4781']",,['Conflicts of Interest: None declared.'],"['(c)Abu Yousuf Md Abdullah, Jane Law, Christopher M Perlman, Zahid A Butt.', 'Originally published in JMIR Public Health and Surveillance', '(https://publichealth.jmir.org), 28.07.2022.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insufficient contact with mental health services may be a contributing factor; however, it is not known what proportion of children have sufficient contact with health professionals to allow delivery of treatment meeting minimal clinical practice guidelines, or how long children experience symptoms prior to receiving treatment. AIMS: To investigate the level of mental healthcare received by Australian children from age 4 years to 14 years. METHOD: Trajectories of mental health symptoms were mapped using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Health professional attendances and psychotropic medications dispensed were identified from linked national Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme records. RESULTS: Four trajectories of mental health symptoms were identified (low, high-decreasing, moderate-increasing and high-increasing). Most children with mental health symptoms had few MBS mental health attendances, and only a minority received care meeting study criteria for minimally adequate treatment. Children in the high-increasing and moderate-increasing trajectories were more likely to access care, yet there was no evidence of improvement in symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: It is important that children and adolescents with mental health problems receive treatment that meets minimal practice guidelines. Further research is needed to identify the quality of care currently provided to children with mental health difficulties and how clinicians can be best funded and supported to provide care meeting minimal practice guidelines.

Although cultural psychiatrists have critiqued RDoC's implications and limitations for its under-developed focus on context and experience, RDoC presents opportunities for synergies with global mental health. It can capture aspects of clinical or sub-clinical behavior which are less dependent upon Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5) and perhaps better elucidate the role of culture in disease expression and resilience. Aim/Results: This article uses the example of migration to describe several starting points for new research: (1) providing components for building an investigable conceptual framework to understand individual's mental health, resilience and adjustment to migration challenges or social adversities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and (2) identifying measurable factors which determine resilience or vulnerability, to guide development and evaluation of targeted prevention, treatment and recovery strategies for mental health in LMICs. CONCLUSION: In such ways, RDoC frameworks could help put the new cutting edge neurobiological dimensional scientific advances in a position to contribute to addressing mental health problems amid social adversities in LMICs. However, this would require a much-expanded commitment by both RDoC and global mental health researchers to address contextual and experiential dimensions.","['Weine, Stevan Merill', 'Langenecker, Scott', 'Arenliu, Aliriza']","['Weine SM', 'Langenecker S', 'Arenliu A']","['1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois in Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', '1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois in Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', '2 Department of Psychology, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Pristina, Pristina, Republic of Kosovo.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180522,England,Int J Soc Psychiatry,The International journal of social psychiatry,0374726,IM,"['Biomedical Research/*standards', 'Cultural Competency', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Global Health/standards', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Mental Health/*standards', '*National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.)', 'Transients and Migrants/*psychology', 'United States']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['LMICs', 'RDoC', 'global', 'mental health', 'migration', 'social adversities']",2018/05/23 06:00,2018/11/28 06:00,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2018/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0020764018778704 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Soc Psychiatry. 2018 Aug;64(5):436-442. doi: 10.1177/0020764018778704.

The basic program addresses issues related to stigma in the workplace, the use of a mental health continuum model to evaluate signs and indicators of mental illness, and the development of coping skills. A manager version further addresses issues such as how to work with an employee who struggles with mental health issues, workplace accommodations, and overall management issues. METHODS: A total of 8 replications evaluated program effects on stigma, self-reported resilience, and coping abilities. RESULTS: The implementation of the program was associated with moderate reductions in stigma and increased self-reported resilience and coping abilities. These results were generally consistent across settings and showed nonsignificant differences when various potential moderators of the program were evaluated (e.g., employees versus managers, public versus private sector, gender, age). Qualitative comments collected at the end of the program suggested that many program participants found the program to be helpful and that the skills were being employed. CONCLUSIONS: Directions for future research, including the need for a randomized trial of The Working Mind, are discussed. Overall, the results suggest that the program is successful in its aims, but further inquiry is encouraged.","['Dobson, Keith S', 'Szeto, Andrew', 'Knaak, Stephanie']","['Dobson KS', 'Szeto A', 'Knaak S']","['1 Department of Psychology, University of Calgary and Mental Health Commission of Canada, Calgary, Alberta.', '1 Department of Psychology, University of Calgary and Mental Health Commission of Canada, Calgary, Alberta.', '2 Mental Health Commission of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190523,United States,Can J Psychiatry,Canadian journal of psychiatry.

Previously, we developed an ultra-brief intervention (UBI) to address mild to moderate psychological concerns, designed to be delivered by primary care clinicians. Recent feasibility testing, including an adaptation for Maori individuals (the indigenous people of New Zealand), showed that the brief intervention was feasible and acceptable to both clinicians and their patients. This protocol describes a large pragmatic randomized controlled trial of our UBI in primary care settings across the greater Wellington region, compared with practice as usual. METHODS/DESIGN: We are using a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial, with primary care practices randomized to exclusively deliver either the UBI or practice as usual to all their recruited participants. The structured, guided self-help UBI is delivered in three brief general practitioner (GP) appointments over a five week period. Participants are invited into the study based on partner primary health organization access criteria (youth, people with low income, or people with Maori or Pacific Island heritage). Improvements in mental health from baseline to post-treatment will be compared between the intervention and control groups using a mixed-models application of analysis of covariance. Data analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis, to increase the real-world relevance of UBI and to meet the study's objective of releasing UBI to primary care clinicians nationwide. DISCUSSION: The UBI is a first-line intervention tool for GPs that models the stepped care approach advocated in New Zealand, against a background of limited access to treatments for often-overlooked patient groups. It is proposed to be accessible to clinicians and patients alike, with the potential to be relevant to primary care clinicians across New Zealand.

However, mental health clinicians should be cognizant of the population that was used to validate the intervention and assess its acceptability to a target group that is culturally different. We systematically reviewed published empirical studies of CBT adapted for religious individuals with mental disorder to determine the extent to which religiously modified CBT can be considered an empirically supported treatment following the criteria delineated by the American Psychological Association Task Force on Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures. Overall, nine randomized controlled trials and one quasi-experimental study were included that compared the effectiveness of religiously modified CBT to standard CBT or other treatment modalities for the treatment of depressive disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, and schizophrenia. The majority of these studies either found no difference in effectiveness between religiously modified CBT compared to standard CBT or other treatment modalities, or early effects that were not sustained. Considering the methodological limitations of the reviewed studies, religiously modified CBT cannot be considered a well-established psychological intervention for the treatment of the foregoing mental disorders following the a priori set criteria at this juncture. Nevertheless, melding religious content with CBT may be an acceptable treatment modality for individuals with strong religious convictions.","['Lim, Caroline', 'Sim, Kang', 'Renjan, Vidhya', 'Sam, Hui Fang', 'Quah, Soo Li']","['Lim C', 'Sim K', 'Renjan V', 'Sam HF', 'Quah SL']","['School of Social Work, University of Southern California, Montgomery Ross Fisher Building, 669 W. 34th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.

Mental health is complexly determined by sociocultural, psychological, demographic characteristics, and some health-risk behaviors such as smoking. This study aimed to explore the association(s) between demographic factors, smoking status, social capital, and poor mental health status in a sample of Iranian men. The data were derived from a survey titled ""Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool-2"" in Tehran, Iran ( n = 11,064). A multistage sampling method was applied in the study. The General Health Questionnaire-28 was used to assess poor mental health status (range = 0-84, scores higher than 23 indicated poor mental health status). The data were analyzed using t test, chi-square test, and multivariate logistic regression. The means of age and family size were 47.14 +/- 17.26 years (range = 20-91) and 3.54 +/- 1.32 individuals (range = 1-15), respectively. The majority of the participants were employed (57%, n = 6,361). The prevalence of poor mental health was 36.36%, 95% confidence interval (CI) [35.46, 37.26]. The components of social capital were positively associated with poor mental health status. Family size (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.93; 95% CI [0.90, 0.96]), job status (unemployed vs. employed, AOR = 1.34; 95% CI [1.16, 1.55]), marital status (widowed and divorced vs. single, AOR = 1.09; 95% CI [1.02, 1.17]), education level (illiterate vs. academic, AOR = 1.18; 95% CI [1.09, 1.29]), and smoking status (smokers vs. nonsmokers, AOR = 1.46; 95% CI [1.31, 1.62]) were directly associated with poor mental health status in the logistic regression model. These results suggest that social capital could be an important approach for men to attain suitable mental health and reduce mental disorders. The high prevalence of poor mental health in men merits more attention in mental health policy and program planning.","['Hassanzadeh, Jafar', 'Asadi-Lari, Mohsen', 'Ghaem, Haleh', 'Kassani, Aziz', 'Niazi, Mohsen', 'Menati, Rostam']","['Hassanzadeh J', 'Asadi-Lari M', 'Ghaem H', 'Kassani A', 'Niazi M', 'Menati R']","['1 Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', '2 Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', '1 Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', '1 Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', '3 University of Kashan, Kashan, Iran.', '3 University of Kashan, Kashan, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20160215,United States,Am J Mens Health,American journal of men's health,101287723,IM,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cultural Characteristics', 'Humans', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Mental Health/ethnology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Smoking/*epidemiology', '*Social Capital', 'Social Conditions', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Urban Population', 'Young Adult']",PMC5734542,,['NOTNLM'],"['mental disorders', 'mental health', 'smoking status', 'social capital']",2016/02/18 06:00,2018/08/11 06:00,['2016/02/18 06:00'],"['2016/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['1557988316630720 [pii]', '10.1177_1557988316630720 [pii]', '10.1177/1557988316630720 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Mens Health. 2018 Jan;12(1):96-103. doi: 10.1177/1557988316630720.

Following the disaster, researchers reported on a wide range of mental health outcomes, especially posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this review, we assess the cumulative body of research evidence about PTSD across the first 10 years following the earthquake. METHODS: We searched the literature in the PubMed, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases (from May 2008 to February 2018) using Wenchuan earthquake and PTSD as keywords. RESULTS: We selected 58 relevant studies. Published findings from the selected period suggested a substantial burden of PTSD on highly exposed survivors. Studies have found that symptoms of PTSD have been associated with a range of risk factors, including sociodemographic factors, trauma exposure characteristics, post-disaster cognitive and emotional states, and social support. Studies have explored the factor structure of PTSD in the affected Chinese population, and researchers have developed a Chinese self-report measure of PTSD symptoms. Several treatments for PTSD have been evaluated, including some indigenous intervention methods. LIMITATIONS: Only a relatively small number of the studies used longitudinal assessments, and the consistency and effectiveness of measurement tools for PTSD require further exploration. More rigorous investigations of the effectiveness of interventions for the prevention and treatment of PTSD are needed. CONCLUSION: The 10-year body of literature is important for the future deployment of disaster relief and an increased understanding of PTSD in China.","['Liang, Yiming', 'Cheng, Jin', 'Ruzek, Josef I', 'Liu, Zhengkui']","['Liang Y', 'Cheng J', 'Ruzek JI', 'Liu Z']","['CAS Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Institute of Psychology, Beijing, China; Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Institute of Psychology, Beijing, China; Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Institute of Psychology, Beijing, China; Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

Worldwide, five mental disorders (depression, alcohol misuse, bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder) represent half of the 10 leading causes of disability and premature death; with mental disorders accounting for 15-30% of disability adjusted life years in the first three decades of life. This provides a solid rational founded in implications for population health as to why reducing and preventing mental health problems in children and adolescents deserves attention. Past research has indicated interventions focussed on building resilience through strengthening protective factors may offer the potential to address mental health problems in children and adolescents, and in particular aid in reducing such problems during times of increased risk or adversity. With childhood and adolescence being critical periods of development, there is a need to reflect on the strengths and limitations of resilience-focussed interventions and anticipated future needs of the world's youth. This conceptual analysis identifies a number of future research directions that may meaningfully add to the evidence base and improve implementation, evaluation, and impact of resilience-focussed interventions. These largely relate to refining the understanding of how resilience protective factors relate to mental health problems in children and adolescents. Important issues and potential opportunities to improve the related research field include improved reporting of intervention content; improved measurement of resilience protective factors in intervention trials; continued reporting and review of evidence of association between protective factors and mental health outcomes; and incorporation of mediation analysis within intervention trials. There is a need for further intervention studies in this space to be conducted as rigorous trials of resilience-focussed approaches based on such evidence of association, with clearly posited mechanisms of change, and inclusive of analysis of differential intervention effects. The suggested implications for research made in this conceptual analysis will aid in improving the quality of the evidence base relevant to the fostering of resilience and prevention of mental health problems in children and adolescents.","['Dray, Julia']",['Dray J'],"['School of Psychological Sciences, College of Engineering, Science and Environment, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.', 'Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.', 'Hunter New England Population Health, Hunter New England Local Health District, Wallsend, NSW 2287, Australia.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton Heights, NSW 2305, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210708,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Health', '*Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Family', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder']",PMC8303353,,['NOTNLM'],"['children and adolescents', 'evaluation', 'implementation', 'mental health problems', 'resilience']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/08/13 06:00,['2021/07/24 01:05'],"['2021/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:05 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph18147315 [pii]', 'ijerph-18-07315 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph18147315 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2021 Jul 8;18(14):7315. doi: 10.3390/ijerph18147315.,14,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4613-2634'],,"['The author declares no conflict of interest.

Alternative, formulation-based approaches remain delimited by cultural norms and linguistic resources. Service users frequently declare the most ordinary aspects of therapy the most helpful: listening, understanding, and respectfulness; these are not contingent upon the presence of a mental health professional. This paper describes ameliorations in states of emotional distress amongst volunteer trainee mechanics in a bicycle workshop, which has little overtly to do with mental health. Possible explanations for these ameliorations, or 'recoveries', are presented. In an enabling setting that offers the social and material resources conducive to particular ways of being, an applied actor-network approach is introduced as a practical way to disentangle the concomitant complexities of bicycles and everyday life. This approach to analysing states of distress-introduced here as 'actor-network therapy'-combines notions of enactment and enhandedness in the appreciation of 'engrenage' - the intriguing intricacy of locally generated, provisional realities.","['Marks, Nicholas']",['Marks N'],"['School of Applied Social Sciences, University of Brighton, Brighton, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210812,England,Sociol Health Illn,Sociology of health & illness,8205036,IM,"['Bicycling', 'Health Personnel', 'Humans', '*Mental Disorders/therapy', 'Mental Health', '*Mental Health Recovery']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['actor-network theory', 'actor-network therapy', 'bicycles', 'enactment', 'engrenage', 'enhandedness', 'mental health', 'wellbeing', 'workshops']",2021/08/13 06:00,2021/10/27 06:00,['2021/08/12 12:36'],"['2021/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/12 12:36 [entrez]']",['10.1111/1467-9566.13357 [doi]'],ppublish,Sociol Health Illn. 2021 Aug;43(7):1700-1719. doi: 10.1111/1467-9566.13357.

A Novel Conceptual Framework to Bridge Public Health, Planning, and Neurourbanism.",48-61,10.1177/0033354920982088 [doi],"Childhood and adolescence are crucial periods for mental and social development. Currently, mental illness among young people is a global epidemic, and rates of disorders such as depression and anxiety are rising. Urban living, compared with rural living, is linked with a higher risk of serious mental illness, which is important because the world is urbanizing faster than ever before. Urban environments and their landscapes, designs, and features influence mental health and well-being. However, no conceptual frameworks to date have detailed the effect of urban environments on young people's mental health, and few studies have considered the growing role of digital and social media in this relationship, leading to calls for the development of holistic approaches to describe this relationship. This article synthesizes existing knowledge on urban places (both built and natural environments) and mental health in the public health and urban planning literature and examines the emerging field of neurourbanism (a multidisciplinary study of the effect of urban environments on mental health and brain activity) to enhance current practice and research. We developed 2 novel conceptual frameworks (1 research-oriented, 1 practice-oriented), adapted from Bronfenbrenner's socioecological model, that focus on the relationship between urban environments and young people's mental health. We added a digital and social media contextual level to the socioecological model, and we applied a multilayer concept to highlight potential cross-field interactions and collaborations. The proposed frameworks can help to guide future practice and research in this area.","['Buttazzoni, Adrian', 'Doherty, Sean', 'Minaker, Leia']","['Buttazzoni A', 'Doherty S', 'Minaker L']","['School of Planning, Faculty of Environment, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.', 'Geographies of Health in Place, Planning, and Public Health Lab, Faculty of Environment, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Geography and Environmental Studies, Faculty of Arts, Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.', 'School of Planning, Faculty of Environment, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.', 'Geographies of Health in Place, Planning, and Public Health Lab, Faculty of Environment, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.', 'School of Public Health and Health Systems, Faculty of Applied Health Sciences, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210209,United States,Public Health Rep,"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",9716844,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'City Planning/organization & administration', '*Environment', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', '*Public Health', 'Urban Population/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC8721758,,['NOTNLM'],"['built environment', 'mental health', 'neurourbanism', 'planning', 'urban environment', 'youth']",2021/02/11 06:00,2022/02/11 06:00,['2021/02/10 05:35'],"['2021/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/02/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/02/10 05:35 [entrez]']","['10.1177_0033354920982088 [pii]', '10.1177/0033354920982088 [doi]']",ppublish,Public Health Rep. 2022 Jan-Feb;137(1):48-61. doi: 10.1177/0033354920982088.

The psychological effect of this policy change is largely unknown. AIMS: To explore the mental health impact of combat exposure among military women. METHODS: Self-report, between-subjects survey data were collected in Iraq and Afghanistan on four occasions between 2009 and 2014 (n = 4139). Differences in mental health, stigmatization, deployment experiences, intimate relationship impact, perception of family support levels, unit cohesion, leadership and help-seeking were compared between deployed men and women. Comparisons were repeated with the study sample stratified by level of combat exposure. Outcomes were examined using logistic regression adjusted for socio-demographic, mental health and military factors. RESULTS: Overall, 4.1% of women and 4.3% of men reported post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (odds ratio (OR) 1.31, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.70-2.46); 22% of women and 16% of men reported symptoms of common mental disorder (CMD) (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.11-2.08). Women were less likely to report mental health-related stigmatization (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.87), negative relationship impact from deployment (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.98) and subjective unit cohesion (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.90). Help-seeking for emotional problems was similar by gender (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.84-1.77). Overall, outcomes were minimally impacted by level of combat exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although women experienced more CMD symptoms, PTSD symptoms were similar by gender. Subject to confirmation of the study findings, women may not require enhanced mental healthcare during deployment for exposure-based conditions such as PTSD when undertaking the ground close combat role.","['Jones, N', 'Greenberg, N', 'Phillips, A', 'Simms, A', 'Wessely, S']","['Jones N', 'Greenberg N', 'Phillips A', 'Simms A', 'Wessely S']","[""Academic Department of Military Mental Health, Weston Education Centre, King's College London, London, UK."", ""Academic Department of Military Mental Health, Weston Education Centre, King's College London, London, UK."", ""Academic Department of Military Mental Health, Weston Education Centre, King's College London, London, UK."", ""King's Centre for Military Health Research, Weston Education Centre, King's College London, London, UK."", ""Academic Department of Military Mental Health, Weston Education Centre, King's College London, London, UK."", ""King's Centre for Military Health Research, Weston Education Centre, King's College London, London, UK.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Occup Med (Lond),"Occupational medicine (Oxford, England)",9205857,IM,"['Adult', 'Afghan Campaign 2001-', 'Combat Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Iraq War, 2003-2011', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Military Family/psychology', 'Military Personnel/*psychology', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Stigma', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United Kingdom']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Combat exposure', 'PTSD', 'deployment', 'mental health', 'military', 'women']",2019/08/14 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/08/13 06:00'],"['2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['5548904 [pii]', '10.1093/occmed/kqz103 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Med (Lond). 2019 Dec 31;69(8-9):549-558. doi: 10.1093/occmed/kqz103.,8-9,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

This paper extends previous assessments of development assistance for mental health (DAMH) in two significant ways; first by contrasting DAMH against that for other disease categories, and second by benchmarking allocated development assistance against the core disease burden metric (disability-adjusted life year) as estimated by the Global Burden of Disease Studies. METHODS: In order to track DAH, IHME collates information from audited financial records, project level data, and budget information from the primary global health channels. The diverse set of data were standardised and put into a single inflation adjusted currency (2015 US dollars) and each dollar disbursed was assigned up to one health focus areas from 1990 through 2015. We tied these health financing estimates to disease burden estimates (DALYs) produced by the Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study to calculated a standardised measure across health focus areas-development assistance for health (in US Dollars) per DALY. FINDINGS: DAMH increased from USD 18 million in 1995 to USD 132 million in 2015, which equates to 0.4% of total DAH in 2015. Over 1990 to 2015, private philanthropy was the most significant source (USD 435 million, 30% of DAMH), while the United States government provided USD 270 million of total DAMH. South and Southeast Asia received the largest proportion of funding for mental health in 2013 (34%). DAMH available per DALY in 2013 ranged from USD 0.27 in East Asia and the Pacific to USD 1.18 in the Middle East and North Africa. HIV/AIDS received the largest ratio of funds to burden-approximately USD150 per DALY in 2013. Mental and substance use disorders and its broader category of non-communicable disease received less than USD1 of DAH per DALY. INTERPRETATION: Combining estimates of disease burden and development assistance for health provides a valuable perspective on DAH resource allocation. The findings from this research point to several patterns of unproportioned distribution of DAH, none more apparent than the low levels of international investment in non-communicable diseases, and in particular, mental health. However, burden of disease estimates are only one input by which DAH should be determined.","['Charlson, F J', 'Dieleman, J', 'Singh, L', 'Whiteford, H A']","['Charlson FJ', 'Dieleman J', 'Singh L', 'Whiteford HA']","['School of Public Health, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'School of Public Health, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170103,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['*Cost of Illness', 'Developing Countries/economics', 'Global Health/*trends', '*Healthcare Financing', 'Humans', 'Income', 'Mental Health/*trends', '*Tissue Donors', 'United Nations']",PMC5207731,,,,2017/01/04 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2017/01/04 06:00'],"['2016/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-16-34202 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0169384 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Jan 3;12(1):e0169384. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0169384. eCollection 2017.,1,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2876-5040'],,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,['PLoS One. 2017 Feb 9;12 (2):e0172259.

Social stigma causes individuals who suspect to be suffering from a mental condition to conceal it, importantly by seeking care from a nonspecialist provider willing to diagnose it as physical disease. In this way, social stigma adds to both the direct and indirect cost of mental health. A microeconomic model depicting an individual who searches for an accommodating provider leads to the prediction that individuals undertake more search in response to a higher degree of social stigma. However, this holds only in the absence of errors in decision-making, typically as long as mental impairment is not too serious. While government and employers have an incentive to reduce the burden of social stigma, their efforts therefore need to focus on persons with a degree of mental impairment that still allows them to avoid errors in pursuing their own interest.","['Zweifel, Peter']",['Zweifel P'],"['Department of Economics, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210216,England,Int J Health Plann Manage,The International journal of health planning and management,8605825,,"['Humans', '*Mental Disorders', 'Mental Health', '*Social Stigma']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['concealment', 'mental health', 'nondisclosure', 'search', 'social stigma']",2021/02/17 06:00,2021/09/30 06:00,['2021/02/16 12:14'],"['2020/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/02/16 12:14 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hpm.3122 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Health Plann Manage. 2021 May;36(3):813-825. doi: 10.1002/hpm.3122.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sample of 434 inmates in Spanish penitentiary centers was studied. An ad hoc designed questionnaire was used and a logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the variables and to what extent they influence emotional well-being. RESULTS: The existence of a statistically significant relationship between the well-being stages and the origin variables (region of origin of the women) and the history of substance addiction were confirmed. No significant relationship has been found for well-being levels from other variables (maternity, social or family support, gender violence or having or not having a partner). CONCLUSIONS: Having a problematic history of drug use negatively affects the levels of emotional well-being of women detained in prisons. The low levels of substance use in women of Latin American origin is related to their more positive levels of emotional well-being.","['Garcia-Vita, M M', 'Ananos-Bedrinana, F T', 'Fernandez-Sanchez, M P']","['Garcia-Vita MM', 'Ananos-Bedrinana FT', 'Fernandez-Sanchez MP']","['Teacher in Universidad del Norte, Colombia.

CONCLUSIONS: The WHO does not prioritise severity in the recent landmark World Mental Health Report. It recommends instead the insuperable task of scaling-up interventions for broadly defined mental health conditions, including milder distress, amongst over a billion people, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries. Schizophrenia, the most severe and disabling of all psychiatric illnesses, is relatively neglected in the WHO report, and the disability associated with bipolar disorder is underestimated. This is inconsistent with the ethical principle of vertical equity, where the most severe illnesses should receive the greatest priority. The global mental health movement must refocus on deinstitutionalisation, and ensure adequate community and general hospital treatment for severe illnesses, especially the 24 million people with schizophrenia.","['Allison, Stephen', 'Bastiampillai, Tarun', 'Looi, Jeffrey Cl', 'Kisely, Stephen R', 'Lakra, Vinay']","['Allison S', 'Bastiampillai T', 'Looi JC', 'Kisely SR', 'Lakra V']","['College of Medicine and Public Health, 1065Flinders University, Adelaide, SA, Australia; Consortium of Australian-Academic Psychiatrists for Independent Policy and Research Analysis (CAPIPRA), Canberra, ACT, Australia.', 'College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, SA, Australia; Consortium of Australian-Academic Psychiatrists for Independent Policy and Research Analysis (CAPIPRA), Canberra, ACT, Australia; Department of Psychiatry, Monash University, Wellington Road, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'The Australian National University School of Medicine and Psychology, Academic Unit of Psychiatry and Addiction Medicine, Canberra, ACT, Australia; Consortium of Australian Academic Psychiatrists for Independent Policy Research and Analysis (CAPIPRA), Canberra, ACT, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, 1974University of Queensland, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Departments of Psychiatry, Community Health and Epidemiology, Dalhouise University, Halifax, NS, Canada; Consortium of Australian Academic Psychiatrists for Independent Policy Research and Analysis (CAPIPRA), Canberra, ACT, Australia.', 'Mental Health, 6451Northern Health, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20230222,England,Australas Psychiatry,Australasian psychiatry : bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists,9613603,IM,"['Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Mental Disorders/therapy', '*Bipolar Disorder/therapy/psychology', '*Schizophrenia/therapy']",PMC10088332,,['NOTNLM'],"['Vertical equity', 'bipolar disorder', 'burden of disease', 'schizophrenia', 'severe psychiatric illness']",2023/02/24 06:00,2023/04/11 06:41,['2023/02/23 01:29'],"['2023/04/11 06:41 [medline]', '2023/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/02/23 01:29 [entrez]']","['10.1177_10398562231154806 [pii]', '10.1177/10398562231154806 [doi]']",ppublish,Australas Psychiatry. 2023 Apr;31(2):182-185. doi: 10.1177/10398562231154806.

This commentary addresses the extent to which the implementation of the measurement studies featured in the special issue centered these goals, drawing on the work of scholars from within and outside the fields of psychiatry and clinical psychology, some who have taken a critical view of these fields.

Yet, they often don't admit they have mental health problems nor are they readily subjected to mental health evaluation by their colleagues due to fear of labeling and general stigma. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of doctors in the service of University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Ilorin, Nigeria was done using a socio-demographic questionnaire and the twelve items General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) using a cut-off point of 3 to indicate possibility of psychiatric disorder (GHQ-12 positive). Non-parametric analysis and regression test of factors associated with psychiatric morbidity was done using SPSS. Level of significance was set at 0.05 p-value. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty one doctors representing 68.9% of the doctors participated in the survey. The point prevalence of psychiatric morbidity among the doctors using the GHQ-12 was 14.9%. Being married, non-participation in social activities and perception of work load as being ""heavy"" were significantly associated with psychiatric morbidity (p-value < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of psychiatric morbidity among doctors at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital was higher than the general population prevalence. Measures to lessen the negative effect of marriage and the perceived heavy work load on mental health of doctors, such as provision of recreational facilities within the hospital and encouragement of doctors' participation in social activities are advanced.","['Issa, Baba Awoye', 'Yussuf, Abdullah Dasliva', 'Olanrewaju, Ganiyu Toyin', 'Abiodun, Olatunji Alao']","['Issa BA', 'Yussuf AD', 'Olanrewaju GT', 'Abiodun OA']","['Department of Behavioural Sciences, College of Health Sciences, University of Ilorin, Nigeria.', 'Department of Behavioural Sciences, College of Health Sciences, University of Ilorin, Nigeria.', 'Department of Behavioural Sciences, College of Health Sciences, University of Ilorin, Nigeria.', 'Department of Behavioural Sciences, College of Health Sciences, University of Ilorin, Nigeria.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141021,Uganda,Pan Afr Med J,The Pan African medical journal,101517926,IM,"['Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Nigeria/epidemiology', 'Physicians/*psychology', 'Prevalence', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC4366118,,['NOTNLM'],"['Doctors', 'Nigeria', 'psychiatric morbidity', 'tertiary hospital']",2014/01/01 00:00,2015/10/22 06:00,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2013/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['PAMJ-19-178 [pii]', '10.11604/pamj.2014.19.178.3642 [doi]']",epublish,Pan Afr Med J. 2014 Oct 21;19:178. doi: 10.11604/pamj.2014.19.178.3642. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, particularly with the advent of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there has been a burst of interest in mental health and mental illness among orthopaedic surgical patients. The mental health of orthopaedic surgeons themselves has also come into focus, with high reported rates of burnout and depression. The aim of this article was to evaluate trends in publication on mental health and mental illness in orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: Web of Science and PubMed were queried to conduct a systematic review. Studies that discussed orthopaedic surgery and mental illnesses or mental health topics over 2001 to 2022 were included. Publications were analyzed by article-, author-, and topic-level characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 416 studies were analyzed after application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Publication volume increased dramatically, demonstrating quadratic growth over 2001 to 2022 (p < 0.001). Eighty-eight percent of studies focused on patients and 10% on surgeons, with studies about patients more likely to focus on mental illness and those about surgeons more likely to focus on mental health (p < 0.001). Twenty percent of publications had a female senior author, and 5 authors collectively accounted for 10% of all publications. Eight journals published more than 10 publications, accounting for 35% of all publications. The most productive subspecialties were arthroplasty (135, 30%), general orthopaedics (87, 21%), and spine (69, 17%). Mental illnesses that were least represented included schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and personality disorders (1% or less of total publications each). CONCLUSION: This analysis showed a dramatically increasing trend in publications on mental health and mental illness in orthopaedic surgery. A high concentration of publications came from a subset of journals and senior authors, and women were overrepresented as senior authors relative to their representation in the field. The results of this analysis identified gaps in the literature, including underrepresented subspecialties, understudied mental illnesses, and study of orthopaedic surgeon mental health, and thus highlighted areas for future investigation.

METHODS: Sociodemographic descriptors, psychiatric antecedents, clinical characteristics and follow-up care were compared before and during the recession for newly assessed patients in community mental health clinics located across a Northern Alberta oil mining region. Data were collected retrospectively as part of a clinical audit process and then analysed with descriptive statistics, cross-tabular univariate analyses with chi-square tests using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: A total of 1,465 patients were included. Sociodemographic factors disproportionately elevated during the recession included male sex, Caucasian ethnicity, own home ownership, higher levels of education and unemployment. More patients seeking mental health care were already taking psychotropic medications (e.g. antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and stimulants). At the same time, disproportionately fewer patients engaged in substance abuse or had a prior formal history of mental health problems. The referral reasons during recession were less likely to be associated with substance abuse or mood concerns and more likely for 'other' reasons. The patients seeking psychiatric help during a recession were disproportionately likely to be diagnosed with personality disorders and 'other' less common diagnostic categories and less likely to suffer from mood or trauma-related diagnoses.

However, there is scant knowledge on the frequency, nature and determinants of contact. METHOD: Retrospective cohort study-an analysis of deaths recorded as suicide by the Northern Ireland Coroner's Office linked with data from General Practice patient records over a 2 year period RESULTS: Eighty-seven per cent of suicides were in contact with General Practice services in the 12 months before suicide. The frequency of contact with services was considerable, particularly among patients with a common mental disorder or substance misuse problems. A diagnosis of psychiatric problems was absent in 40% of suicides. Excluding suicide attempts, the main predictors of a noted general practitioner concern for patient suicidality are male gender, frequency of consultations, diagnosis of mental illness and substance misuse. CONCLUSIONS: Despite widespread and frequent contact, a substantial proportion of suicidal people were undiagnosed and untreated for mental health problems. General Practitioner alertness to suicidality may be too narrowly focused.","['Leavey, Gerard', 'Rosato, Michael', 'Galway, Karen', 'Hughes, Lynette', 'Mallon, Sharon', 'Rondon, Janeet']","['Leavey G', 'Rosato M', 'Galway K', 'Hughes L', 'Mallon S', 'Rondon J']","['Bamford Centre for Mental Health & Wellbeing, Ulster University, Cromore Road, Coleraine, BT52 1SA, Londonderry, Northern Ireland. g.leavey@ulster.ac.uk.', 'Bamford Centre for Mental Health & Wellbeing, Ulster University, Cromore Road, Coleraine, BT52 1SA, Londonderry, Northern Ireland.', ""School of Nursing and Midwifery, Queen's University Belfast, Medical Biology Building, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast, BT 9 7BL, Northern Ireland."", 'Bamford Centre for Mental Health & Wellbeing, Ulster University, Cromore Road, Coleraine, BT52 1SA, Londonderry, Northern Ireland.', 'Faculty of Health and Social Care, Horlock Building, Open University, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA, Northern Ireland.', 'Bamford Centre for Mental Health & Wellbeing, Ulster University, Cromore Road, Coleraine, BT52 1SA, Londonderry, Northern Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160430,England,BMC Psychiatry,BMC psychiatry,100968559,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*General Practitioners', '*Help-Seeking Behavior', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Northern Ireland', 'Primary Health Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Suicide/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC4852417,,['NOTNLM'],"['General practice', 'Health services', 'Help-seeking', 'Suicidality', 'Suicide predictors']",2016/05/04 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/05/04 06:00'],"['2015/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12888-016-0824-7 [pii]', '824 [pii]', '10.1186/s12888-016-0824-7 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Psychiatry. 2016 Apr 30;16:120. doi: 10.1186/s12888-016-0824-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These may be to some extent remediable in that social factors are important in deciding the chances of admission to hospital, as well as the frequency of suicide, which reaches a peak among the aged in most countries. All communities possess valuable assets in the form of existing links between the aged and their families which may be lost by indiscriminate community planning. Although some psychological decline is inevitable during senescence, it is becoming clear that much that once passed for the ineluctable effects of mental and physical aging is due to disease that may be ameliorated or cured. The relationship between mental and physical health is particularly close in old age, and the effective treatment of the aged person with a psychiatric disorder demands the full resources of general medicine as well as psychiatry. For successful rehabilitation a full community service for the aged and proper integration of the work of the family doctor with that of preventive and hospital services are essential. The possibilities of prevention can be enhanced by fostering physical well-being and healthy adjustment during earlier stages of life, as well as by ascertaining, and remedying as far as possible, the mental and physical disorders of the aged in the early stages of their development. There is great scope for biological, medical and sociological research to define reasons for the wide variations in mental and physical well-being in old age.","['ROTH, M']",['ROTH M'],,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Bull World Health Organ,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,7507052,OM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Geriatrics/*psychology', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', '*Mental Disorders', '*Mental Health', '*Suicide']",PMC2537974,,['NLM'],['*GERIATRICS/psychology'],1959/01/01 00:00,1959/01/01 00:01,['1959/01/01 00:00'],"['1959/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1959/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1959/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull World Health Organ. 1959;21(4-5):527-68.,4-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most explanations for PTSD-CVD associations conceptualize PTSD as a stress-related mental health disorder that elicits physiological, behavioral, and psychological responses that are causal factors in the development of cardiovascular disorders. This article reviews evidence for the broader physical health consequences of PTSD, and presents a conceptual model based on research suggesting that PTSD is a systemic disorder. Specifically, research findings indicate that diagnostic criteria are just the ""tip of the iceberg"" of a broader systemic disorder with elements that are cardiovascular risk factors. These systemic physiological and behavioral elements therefore should not be regarded as accompanying but unrelated diseases or comorbidities, but as inherent components of PTSD that directly impact the development of CVD. The systemic disorder approach has implications for the conceptualization of PTSD as a cardiovascular risk factor, for needed research on PTSD and CVD, and for clinical efforts to reduce PTSD-associated cardiovascular risk. It is suggested that treatments that aim to reduce cardiovascular disease risk need to address both the PTSD diagnostic components and its associated cardiovascular risk factors. Further research is needed to test the applicability and implications of the systemic disorder perspective.

Although ART treatment patients often experience heavy physical and psychological burden, few epidemiologic studies have been conducted in Japan. We examined mental health and health-related quality of life (QOL) among women at early stages of treatment. We recruited 513 women who have initiated ART treatment, either in-vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection, from four medical facilities in the Tokyo area and through web-based approaches. At baseline, we collected socio-demographic information and assessed depressive symptoms, anxiety, and QOL. Descriptive analyses were performed overall and stratified by factors such as age. Mild depressive symptoms or worse, assessed with Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, were observed among 54% of participants. Mean score for State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was 52 with a standard deviation of 11 for the state, and 39% were categorized as high anxiety. QOL results, assessed with SF-12, showed the same negative tendency for social functioning and role (emotional), while general health and physical functioning were consistent with the national average. Young participants appeared to suffer mentally more than older participants (p < 0.01 for depressive symptoms). Our findings suggest that patients may be at high risk of depressive symptoms, high anxiety, and low QOL even from the early stages of ART treatment.","['Kato, Tsuguhiko', 'Sampei, Makiko', 'Saito, Kazuki', 'Morisaki, Naho', 'Urayama, Kevin Y']","['Kato T', 'Sampei M', 'Saito K', 'Morisaki N', 'Urayama KY']","['Department of Social Medicine, National Center for Child Health and Development, 2-10-1 Okura, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 157-8535, Japan. kato-tg@ncchd.go.jp.', 'Department of Social Medicine, National Center for Child Health and Development, 2-10-1 Okura, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 157-8535, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perinatal and Maternal Medicine (Ibaraki), Graduate School, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Social Medicine, National Center for Child Health and Development, 2-10-1 Okura, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 157-8535, Japan.', 'Department of Social Medicine, National Center for Child Health and Development, 2-10-1 Okura, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 157-8535, Japan.', ""Graduate School of Public Health, St. Luke's International University, 3-6-2 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210406,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Adult', 'Anxiety/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Anxiety Disorders/psychology', 'Depression/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Depressive Disorder/psychology', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro/psychology', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Mental Health/ethnology/trends', 'Middle Aged', 'Personality Inventory', 'Pregnancy', 'Quality of Life/psychology', 'Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/*psychology', 'Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic/psychology']",PMC8024276,,,,2021/04/08 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2021/04/07 06:11'],"['2020/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/07 06:11 [entrez]', '2021/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-021-87057-6 [pii]', '87057 [pii]', '10.1038/s41598-021-87057-6 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2021 Apr 6;11(1):7538. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-87057-6.,1,,,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,['Sci Rep. 2021 Nov 17;11(1):22793.

A randomized controlled trial with a six-month and two-year follow-up.,e100911,10.1371/journal.pone.0100911 [doi] e100911,"BACKGROUND: According to a recent report from the European Brain Council and the European Colleague of Neuropsychopharmacology the one year prevalence of some kind of mental disorder is around 27% among the adult population in Europe. Research has shown a lack of mental health literacy in the population in general and it is thus important to find ways to improve the public's knowledge and skills to provide first hand support to people with mental disorders. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is a training program that has shown positive changes in knowledge and helping behavior. This study investigates if MHFA training in a Swedish context provides a sustained improvement in knowledge about mental disorders, a better ability to be helpful in contacts with people who are ill and if it changes attitudes in a positive direction. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The introduction of the training program was made in accordance with the constructor's instructions. Participants were mainly public sector employees from a county in the west of Sweden. The study was a randomized controlled trial with an experiment group (n = 199) and a control group (n = 207) placed on a waiting list during a 6-month follow-up. A two-year follow-up was conducted for participants (n = 155) from both the intervention and waiting list group who had completed the training and during the follow-up been in contact with persons with mental disorders. The intervention group improved in knowledge as well as in confidence in providing help for someone in need. The two-year follow-up showed that the improvements were to a great extent maintained. CONCLUSIONS: Mental Health First Aid might raise the level of awareness of mental disorders and have an influence on the number of people who can receive professional treatment for their problems.","['Svensson, Bengt', 'Hansson, Lars']","['Svensson B', 'Hansson L']","['Department of Health Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Health Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140625,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'First Aid/*methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Education/*methods', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*therapy', 'Mental Health/*education', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Program Evaluation', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time Factors']",PMC4071003,,,,2014/06/26 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2014/06/26 06:00'],"['2014/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-14-00783 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0100911 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 25;9(6):e100911. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0100911. eCollection 2014.,6,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding how well a teacher concern predicts mental disorder in a child or young person is important for mental health teams who need to respond to referrals. METHOD: This secondary analysis of the 2004 British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Survey used the first item of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) Impact subscale to indicate concern about a child or young person's mental health. Mental disorder according to DSM IVR criteria was assessed using the multi-informant Development and Well-Being Assessment. We compared the proportion with and without mental disorder according to the presence or absence of teacher concern. RESULTS: Teacher concern was moderately predictive (49% with teacher concern had a disorder) and sensitive (teacher concern present among 56% with disorder), while lack of teacher concern was highly predictive (only 5% had disorder) and specific (94% no disorder). Teacher concern was associated with significantly poorer mental health (mean teacher SDQ total difficulty score 19.6, SD 5.6 with disorder, mean 15.0; SD 5.1 if no disorder) compared to children without teacher concern (mean 9.6, SD 5.5 with disorder, and 4.9; SD 4.3 if no disorder; F (3, 5,931) = 1527.228, p = .001). If both teacher and parents were concerned, the child or young person was much more likely to have a disorder. CONCLUSION: A lack of teacher concern can reassure mental health practitioners in the vast majority of cases. While teacher concern does identify those with poorer mental health, it is only moderately predictive of a disorder. When concerned about a child or young person, discussions with parents or others who know them may help teachers identify those who most need support. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: The emphasis on schools as a major setting to provide support and identify the need for referral to specialist mental health services means service commissioners, providers and practitioners could benefit from insight into how predictive a teacher's concern is of childhood mental health conditions and how this may vary with the type of disorder If teachers are not concerned about a child, practitioners can be reassured that there is unlikely to be a significant problem with their mental health, although this will be less certain in schools whose pupils are likely to have a higher than average levels of difficulty Teacher concerns do not necessarily differentiate between clinically impairing and mild/ moderate mental health difficulties, but do identify children in poorer mental health Asking for corroboration of concern from other sources increases the strength of the association to severe mental health disorders.","['Mathews, Frances', 'Newlove-Delgado, Tamsin', 'Finning, Katie', 'Boyle, Christopher', 'Hayes, Rachel', 'Johnston, Patrick', 'Ford, Tamsin']","['Mathews F', 'Newlove-Delgado T', 'Finning K', 'Boyle C', 'Hayes R', 'Johnston P', 'Ford T']","['College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.', 'College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.', 'College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.', 'Graduate School of Education, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.', 'College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.', 'Place2Be, London, UK.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],['10/3006/07/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200421,England,Child Adolesc Ment Health,Child and adolescent mental health,101142157,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', '*Mental Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Mental Health', '*Mental Health Services', 'Schools']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Teacher', 'adolescent', 'child', 'mental disorder', 'mental health', 'schools']",2020/04/22 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2020/04/22 06:00'],"['2020/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/camh.12390 [doi]'],ppublish,Child Adolesc Ment Health. 2021 May;26(2):99-105. doi: 10.1111/camh.12390.

The majority of clients have low levels of education and employment, high rates of incarceration and unstable housing and poor social networks, and 70 % do not access local health services. These factors increase the risk of poor mental health, and it has been documented that PWID have elevated rates of mood, anxiety, personality and psychotic disorders; post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); and higher rates of trauma exposure, suicidality and self-harm. The current study is the first to investigate the mental health among clients of a SIF. Validated instruments to examine clients' mental health, social networks and trauma histories were administered to 50 frequently attending clients by a mental health nurse. The majority of respondents were unemployed, homeless and had a history of incarceration, and 82 % report they had been diagnosed with a mental health problem, but only 24 % report they were receiving treatment. Respondents had poor social networks, had poorer mental health symptoms compared to US inpatients and had experienced multiple traumatic events, and a high number of respondents had scores indicative of PTSD. These results highlight the need for mental health clinicians to be employed in SIFs and other drug consumption rooms (DCRs) to assist clients to address their mental health and psychosocial needs, particularly in light of the fact that these services are often the only places these PWID engage with in an ongoing way.","['Goodhew, Mark', 'Salmon, Allison M', 'Marel, Christina', 'Mills, Katherine L', 'Jauncey, Marianne']","['Goodhew M', 'Salmon AM', 'Marel C', 'Mills KL', 'Jauncey M']","['Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre, PO Box 293, Kings Cross, Sydney, NSW, 1340, Australia. mgoodhew@uniting.org.', 'Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre, PO Box 293, Kings Cross, Sydney, NSW, 1340, Australia.', 'Centre of Research Excellence in Mental Health and Substance Use, National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC), University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.', 'Centre of Research Excellence in Mental Health and Substance Use, National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC), University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.', 'Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre, PO Box 293, Kings Cross, Sydney, NSW, 1340, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20161012,England,Harm Reduct J,Harm reduction journal,101153624,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Ill-Housed Persons/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Needle-Exchange Programs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Needs Assessment', 'New South Wales/epidemiology', 'Social Support', 'Substance Abuse Treatment Centers/statistics & numerical data', 'Substance Abuse, Intravenous/*psychology', 'Unemployment/statistics & numerical data']",PMC5062820,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mental disorders', 'Mental health', 'Supervised injecting centres, supervised injecting facilities, illicit drugs']",2016/10/14 06:00,2017/11/14 06:00,['2016/10/14 06:00'],"['2016/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12954-016-0117-y [pii]', '117 [pii]', '10.1186/s12954-016-0117-y [doi]']",epublish,Harm Reduct J. 2016 Oct 12;13(1):29. doi: 10.1186/s12954-016-0117-y.,1,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1108-8293'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Christchurch City has experienced widespread damage, ongoing disruption and building demolitions resulting in many difficulties for the residents of the Christchurch area. We explore what impact the earthquakes have had on the mental and physical health of a random sample of 50-year-olds who live in the Christchurch area. METHODS: The 295 participants were selected from the electoral rolls for participation in the CHALICE study, a longitudinal study of ageing. Self-reported health status was assessed using the standardised Short Form 36 version 2 health survey (SF-36v2), a 36-item questionnaire, and results from the eight subscales compared to a national health survey. Mood disorders were assessed and the results were compared to other local and national studies. RESULTS: Since the onset of the earthquakes and throughout the study period, participating middle-aged Christchurch residents have mean SF-36v2 scores significantly lower than population norms in the mental health, vitality, social functioning and role-emotional subscales (Cohen's d ranged from -0.270 to -0.357, all p < 0.001), while there was no evidence of reduced physical health. Rates of current major depressive disorder were 7.5% in the earthquake survivors compared to 5.1% and 3.7% in other historical, local and national surveys. Similarly, bipolar disorder prevalence was 2.8% in the earthquake survivors compared to 2.2% and 1.4% in other studies. CONCLUSION: Eighteen months after the first earthquake the significant adverse impact on mental health clearly continues. The ongoing provision of additional mental health services and consideration of these adverse mental health effects in relation to other social policies remains necessary and fundamental.","['Spittlehouse, Janet K', 'Joyce, Peter R', 'Vierck, Esther', 'Schluter, Philip J', 'Pearson, John F']","['Spittlehouse JK', 'Joyce PR', 'Vierck E', 'Schluter PJ', 'Pearson JF']","['Department of Psychological Medicine, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand janet.spittlehouse@otago.ac.nz.', 'Department of Psychological Medicine, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Department of Psychological Medicine, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'School of Health Sciences, University of Canterbury, New Zealand The University of Queensland, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Biostatistics and Computational Biology Unit, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140312,England,Aust N Z J Psychiatry,The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,0111052,IM,"['Bipolar Disorder/epidemiology/etiology', 'Depressive Disorder, Major/epidemiology/etiology', '*Disasters', '*Earthquakes', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Health impact', 'SF-36', 'bipolar disorder', 'depression', 'earthquakes', 'mental health', 'physical health', 'self-reported health status']",2014/03/14 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2014/03/14 06:00'],"['2014/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['0004867414527522 [pii]', '10.1177/0004867414527522 [doi]']",ppublish,Aust N Z J Psychiatry. 2014 Aug;48(8):756-63. doi: 10.1177/0004867414527522.

32264914,NLM,MEDLINE,20201216,20201216,1741-7015 (Electronic) 1741-7015 (Linking),18,2020 Apr 8,Bridging the gap between complexity science and clinical practice by formalizing idiographic theories: a computational model of functional analysis.,99,10.1186/s12916-020-01558-1 [doi] 99,"BACKGROUND: The past decades of research have seen an increase in statistical tools to explore the complex dynamics of mental health from patient data, yet the application of these tools in clinical practice remains uncommon. This is surprising, given that clinical reasoning, e.g., case conceptualizations, largely coincides with the dynamical system approach. We argue that the gap between statistical tools and clinical practice can partly be explained by the fact that current estimation techniques disregard theoretical and practical considerations relevant to psychotherapy. To address this issue, we propose that case conceptualizations should be formalized. We illustrate this approach by introducing a computational model of functional analysis, a framework commonly used by practitioners to formulate case conceptualizations and design patient-tailored treatment. METHODS: We outline the general approach of formalizing idiographic theories, drawing on the example of a functional analysis for a patient suffering from panic disorder. We specified the system using a series of differential equations and simulated different scenarios; first, we simulated data without intervening in the system to examine the effects of avoidant coping on the development of panic symptomatic. Second, we formalized two interventions commonly used in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; exposure and cognitive reappraisal) and subsequently simulated their effects on the system. RESULTS: The first simulation showed that the specified system could recover several aspects of the phenomenon (panic disorder), however, also showed some incongruency with the nature of panic attacks (e.g., rapid decreases were not observed). The second simulation study illustrated differential effects of CBT interventions for this patient. All tested interventions could decrease panic levels in the system. CONCLUSIONS: Formalizing idiographic theories is promising in bridging the gap between complexity science and clinical practice and can help foster more rigorous scientific practices in psychotherapy, through enhancing theory development. More precise case conceptualizations could potentially improve intervention planning and treatment outcomes. We discuss applications in psychotherapy and future directions, amongst others barriers for systematic theory evaluation and extending the framework to incorporate interactions between individual systems, relevant for modeling social learning processes. With this report, we hope to stimulate future efforts in formalizing clinical frameworks.","['Burger, Julian', 'van der Veen, Date C', 'Robinaugh, Donald J', 'Quax, Rick', 'Riese, Harriette', 'Schoevers, Robert A', 'Epskamp, Sacha']","['Burger J', 'van der Veen DC', 'Robinaugh DJ', 'Quax R', 'Riese H', 'Schoevers RA', 'Epskamp S']","['University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University Center Psychiatry (UCP) Interdisciplinary Center Psychopathology and Emotion Regulation (ICPE), Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ, Groningen, The Netherlands. j.burger@uva.nl.', 'University of Amsterdam, Institute for Advanced Study, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. j.burger@uva.nl.', 'University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University Center Psychiatry (UCP) Interdisciplinary Center Psychopathology and Emotion Regulation (ICPE), Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Harvard University, Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, .Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'University of Amsterdam, Institute for Advanced Study, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University Center Psychiatry (UCP) Interdisciplinary Center Psychopathology and Emotion Regulation (ICPE), Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University Center Psychiatry (UCP) Interdisciplinary Center Psychopathology and Emotion Regulation (ICPE), Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'University of Amsterdam, Institute for Advanced Study, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['K23 MH113805/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', '406.18.542/NWO/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200408,England,BMC Med,BMC medicine,101190723,IM,"['Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Psychotherapy/*methods']",PMC7333286,,['NOTNLM'],"['Complex systems', 'Computational modeling', 'Dynamical systems', 'Formalizing theories', 'Functional analysis', 'Idiographic approach', 'Network analysis', 'Ordinary differential equations', 'Process-based psychotherapy', 'Theory development']",2020/04/09 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2020/04/09 06:00'],"['2019/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12916-020-01558-1 [pii]', '1558 [pii]', '10.1186/s12916-020-01558-1 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med. 2020 Apr 8;18(1):99. doi: 10.1186/s12916-020-01558-1.,1,,,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A secondary aim was to investigate associations between habitual sleep characteristics and burnout. North American firefighters (n = 6,307) completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory (emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, personal accomplishment), and were screened for sleep disorders and self-reported current mental health conditions and sleep characteristics. Multiple logistic regression analyses examined associations between sleep, mental health outcomes and burnout. Firefighters screening positive for a sleep disorder, particularly insomnia, had increased risk of emotional exhaustion (adjusted odds ratio 3.78, 95% confidence interval 2.97-4.79). Firefighters self-reporting a current mental health condition were at greater risk of emotional exhaustion (adjusted odds ratio 3.45, 95% confidence interval 2.79-4.27). Sleep during overnight work mediated the impact of having a sleep disorder and mental health condition on high burnout. Sleepiness and sleep deficit (difference between required and actual sleep), even in firefighters without sleep disorder risk, were associated with depersonalisation (adjusted odds ratio 1.65, 95% confidence interval 1.34-2.03 and adjusted odds ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.57, respectively) and low personal accomplishment (adjusted odds ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.47 and adjusted odds ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.35, respectively). Sleep and mental health problems were associated with increased risk of burnout in firefighters, and sleep during overnight work mediated these relationships. The results suggest the need to examine the effectiveness of occupational interventions that improve the opportunity for sleep, together with screening for and treating sleep disorders, to reduce burnout risk.","['Wolkow, Alexander P', 'Barger, Laura K', ""O'Brien, Conor S"", 'Sullivan, Jason P', 'Qadri, Salim', 'Lockley, Steven W', 'Czeisler, Charles A', 'Rajaratnam, Shantha M W']","['Wolkow AP', 'Barger LK', ""O'Brien CS"", 'Sullivan JP', 'Qadri S', 'Lockley SW', 'Czeisler CA', 'Rajaratnam SMW']","['School of Psychological Sciences and Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Departments of Medicine and Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Division of Sleep Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', ""Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Departments of Medicine and Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", ""Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Departments of Medicine and Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", ""Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Departments of Medicine and Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'School of Psychological Sciences and Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Departments of Medicine and Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Division of Sleep Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', ""Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Departments of Medicine and Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Division of Sleep Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'School of Psychological Sciences and Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Departments of Medicine and Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Division of Sleep Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 OH010300/OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United States', 'R01 OH011773/OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United States', 'U01 HL111478/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001102/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190526,England,J Sleep Res,Journal of sleep research,9214441,IM,"['Adult', 'Burnout, Professional/psychology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Firefighters/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*trends', 'Self Report', 'Sleep Wake Disorders/*complications/*psychology', 'Work Schedule Tolerance/*psychology']",PMC7433311,['NIHMS1614153'],['NOTNLM'],"['burnout', 'firefighters', 'insomnia', 'mental health']",2019/05/28 06:00,2020/04/29 06:00,['2019/05/28 06:00'],"['2018/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jsr.12869 [doi]'],ppublish,J Sleep Res. 2019 Dec;28(6):e12869. doi: 10.1111/jsr.12869.

Although Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is the recommended first-line treatment for insomnia, high rates of sedative-hypnotic prescribing continue. There is little research investigating the rates and factors impacting insomnia treatment recommendations, both behavioral and pharmacological. Participants: A cohort of 5,254 Veterans referred for either CBT-I or prescribed a sedative-hypnotic medication at a single VA Medical Center composed the group of participants. Methods: The current study evaluated the rates of insomnia treatment recommendations and the extent to which demographic variables, psychiatric disorders, and sleep disorders contributed to referrals for CBT-I or prescriptions for sedative-hypnotic medications within a large administrative data set. Results: Military service-related disability, insomnia diagnosis, and having one or more psychiatric diagnoses were associated with a greater likelihood of receiving a CBT-I referral (alone or in addition to a sedative-hypnotic medication) rather than a sedative-hypnotic prescription alone. A diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with a greater likelihood of receiving a sedative-hypnotic medication alone versus a CBT-I referral. Conclusions: Overall, the findings suggest that sedative-hypnotic medications were overwhelmingly the primary treatment recommendation despite evidence to support CBT-I as the recommended first-line treatment. However, key factors were identified that increased the likelihood of Veterans being referred for CBT-I. Suggestions for better identifying and understanding key factors that impact treatment recommendations are discussed.","['Bramoweth, Adam D', 'Renqvist, Jenna G', 'Hanusa, Barbara H', 'Walker, Jon D', 'Germain, Anne', 'Atwood, Charles W Jr']","['Bramoweth AD', 'Renqvist JG', 'Hanusa BH', 'Walker JD', 'Germain A', 'Atwood CW Jr']","['VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170502,England,Behav Sleep Med,Behavioral sleep medicine,101149327,IM,"['Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Demography/*trends', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Middle Aged', 'Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*therapy', 'Veterans/*psychology']",,,,,2017/05/04 06:00,2020/07/16 06:00,['2017/05/03 06:00'],"['2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15402002.2017.1318752 [doi]'],ppublish,Behav Sleep Med. 2019 Mar-Apr;17(2):181-190. doi: 10.1080/15402002.2017.1318752.

The present study sought to investigate factors associated with the accurate reporting of mental health symptoms amongst police officers. METHODS: A total of 90 serving police officers completed identical mental health screening surveys, one administered by the employer and the other anonymously by an independent organisation. Responses were then linked to compare differences in the number and severity of mental health symptoms reported on each questionnaire. RESULTS: Comparisons of matched self-report scores indicated that employees under-reported symptoms of mental health disorders when completing screening administered by their employer, with only 76.3% of symptoms declared. Under-reporting occurred regardless of gender and symptom type. Less senior staff (p = 0.05) and those with the most severe post-traumatic stress disorder and common mental disorder symptoms (p = 0.008) were significantly more likely to under-report symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Employer-administered mental health screening is not able to accurately capture all mental health symptoms amongst first responders. The fact that the severity of symptoms predicted the level of under-reporting means that simple changes to cut-off values cannot correct this problem.","['Marshall, Ruth E', 'Milligan-Saville, Josie', 'Petrie, Katherine', 'Bryant, Richard A', 'Mitchell, Philip B', 'Harvey, Samuel B']","['Marshall RE', 'Milligan-Saville J', 'Petrie K', 'Bryant RA', 'Mitchell PB', 'Harvey SB']","['School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia.', 'School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia.', 'Black Dog Institute, University of New South Wales, Hospital Rd, Randwick, 2031, Australia.', 'School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia.', 'Black Dog Institute, University of New South Wales, Hospital Rd, Randwick, 2031, Australia.', 'Black Dog Institute, University of New South Wales, Hospital Rd, Randwick, 2031, Australia.', 'School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia.', 'School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia.', 'Black Dog Institute, University of New South Wales, Hospital Rd, Randwick, 2031, Australia.', 'Black Dog Institute, University of New South Wales, Hospital Rd, Randwick, 2031, Australia. s.harvey@unsw.edu.au.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210308,England,BMC Psychiatry,BMC psychiatry,100968559,IM,"['Humans', 'Mass Screening', 'Mental Health', '*Police', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC7938555,,['NOTNLM'],"['Health screening', 'Mental health', 'Monitoring', 'Post-traumatic stress disorder', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Reporting', 'Screening', 'Self-report']",2021/03/10 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2021/03/09 05:40'],"['2020/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/09 05:40 [entrez]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12888-021-03125-1 [pii]', '3125 [pii]', '10.1186/s12888-021-03125-1 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Psychiatry. 2021 Mar 8;21(1):135. doi: 10.1186/s12888-021-03125-1.,1,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9580-3743'],,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk of developing a mental disorder at some point in life is around 40%. Therefore, mental disorders are among the most common diseases. Despite the introduction of newer psychotropic drugs, disorder-specific psychotherapy and stimulation techniques, many of those affected still show insufficient symptom remission and a chronic course of the disorder. Conceptual and technological progress in recent years has enabled a new, more flexible and personalized form of mental health care. Both the traditional therapeutic concepts and newer decentralized, modularly structured, track units, together with innovative digital technologies, will offer individualized therapeutic options in order to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life of patients with mental illnesses. The primary goal of closely combining inpatient care concepts with innovative technologies is to provide comprehensive therapy and aftercare concepts for all individual needs of patients with mental disorders. Last but not least, this also ensures that specialist psychiatric treatment is available regardless of location. In twenty-first century psychiatry, modern care structures must be effectively linked to the current dynamics of digital transformation. This narrative review is dedicated to the theoretical and practical aspects of a cross-sectoral treatment system combined with innovative digital technologies in the psychiatric-psychotherapeutic field. The authors aim to illuminate these therapy modalities using the example of the Central Institute of Mental Health in Mannheim.","['Hirjak, Dusan', 'Reininghaus, Ulrich', 'Braun, Urs', 'Sack, Markus', 'Tost, Heike', 'Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas']","['Hirjak D', 'Reininghaus U', 'Braun U', 'Sack M', 'Tost H', 'Meyer-Lindenberg A']","['Klinik fur Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Zentralinstitut fur Seelische Gesundheit, Medizinische Fakultat Mannheim, Universitat Heidelberg, J5, 68159, Mannheim, Deutschland. dusan.hirjak@zi-mannheim.de.', 'Abteilung Public Mental Health, Zentralinstitut fur Seelische Gesundheit, Medizinische Fakultat Mannheim, Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Deutschland.', ""ESRC Centre for Society and Mental Health, King's College London, London, Grossbritannien."", ""Centre for Epidemiology and Public Health, Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, Grossbritannien."", 'Klinik fur Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Zentralinstitut fur Seelische Gesundheit, Medizinische Fakultat Mannheim, Universitat Heidelberg, J5, 68159, Mannheim, Deutschland.', 'Abteilung Neuroimaging, Zentralinstitut fur Seelische Gesundheit, Medizinische Fakultat Mannheim, Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Deutschland.', 'Klinik fur Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Zentralinstitut fur Seelische Gesundheit, Medizinische Fakultat Mannheim, Universitat Heidelberg, J5, 68159, Mannheim, Deutschland.', 'Klinik fur Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Zentralinstitut fur Seelische Gesundheit, Medizinische Fakultat Mannheim, Universitat Heidelberg, J5, 68159, Mannheim, Deutschland.']",['ger'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210305,Germany,Nervenarzt,Der Nervenarzt,0400773,IM,"['Humans', '*Mental Disorders/diagnosis/therapy', 'Mental Health', '*Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of Life']",PMC8897366,,['NOTNLM'],"['Big data', 'Soteria', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic concepts', 'Track unit']",2021/03/07 06:00,2022/03/09 06:00,['2021/03/06 05:43'],"['2021/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/03/06 05:43 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00115-021-01086-0 [pii]', '1086 [pii]', '10.1007/s00115-021-01086-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Nervenarzt. 2022 Mar;93(3):288-296. doi: 10.1007/s00115-021-01086-0.

We examined all US interventional mental health trials submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov between October 1, 2007 and April 30, 2018 to identify trends in trial characteristics, comparisons with non-mental health trials, and trial attributes associated with discontinuation and results reporting. International data were excluded to minimize potential confounding. Over this period, mental health and non-mental health trials grew at similar rates, though Industry and US government-funded trials declined and academic medical center/hospital/other (AMC/Hosp/Oth) funded trials grew faster in mental health research. The proportion of trials with safeguards against bias, including blinding and oversight by data monitoring committees (DMCs), decreased. This occurred during growth in the proportion of trials studying behavioral and non-pharmacological interventions, which often cannot be blinded and do not require DMC oversight. There was concurrent decline in pharmaceutical trials. There was significant growth in trials studying Non-DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5) conditions (e.g. suicidality and wellness), as well as substance use, anxiety, and neurocognitive disorders. One in 12 trials was discontinued. Trial discontinuation was associated with industry and AMC/Hosp/Oth funders, pharmaceutical interventions, and lack of DMC oversight. Only 29.9% of completed trials reported results to the registry. Decreased results reporting was associated with behavioral interventions, phase 1 trials, and industry and AMC/Hosp/Oth funders. The main implications of these data are that funding is shifting away from traditional government and industry sources, there is increasing interest in non-pharmacological treatments and Non-DSM conditions, and there are changing norms in trial design characteristics regarding safeguards against bias. These trends can guide researchers and funding bodies when considering the trajectory of future mental health research.","['Wortzel, Joshua R', 'Turner, Brandon E', 'Weeks, Brannon T', 'Fragassi, Christopher', 'Ramos, Virginia', 'Truong, Thanh', 'Li, Desiree', 'Sahak, Omar', 'Lee, Hochang Benjamin']","['Wortzel JR', 'Turner BE', 'Weeks BT', 'Fragassi C', 'Ramos V', 'Truong T', 'Li D', 'Sahak O', 'Lee HB']","['Department of Psychiatry, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States of America.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara, Santa Clara, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, MGH, Harvard University, Boston, MA, United States of America.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States of America.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States of America.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States of America.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200605,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Bias', 'Biomedical Research/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees/standards', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/standards/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*therapy', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Patient Selection', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Research Design/standards', 'United States']",PMC7274444,,,,2020/06/06 06:00,2020/08/21 06:00,['2020/06/06 06:00'],"['2019/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['PONE-D-19-31325 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0233996 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Jun 5;15(6):e0233996. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0233996. eCollection 2020.,6,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5106-0802', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8379-4018']",,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We make the argument based on a review of the development of personality disorders in persons exposed to mental trauma caused by war, and we make the argument that it is possible to demonstrate both physiological and anatomical changes in the brain of such persons, which could account for the observed behavioural and personality changes.

They acknowledged that sex helps to maintain mental balance. Very interesting is their observation that sex may help mental patients to recover. Nevertheless they stressed emphatically that sex is beneficial only when there is a measure in it, so they believed that sexual abstinence or excessive sexual activity affect negatively the mental and physical health of man. Ancient Greek physicians reached this conclusion by empirical observation. They tried to justify the mental imbalance, as the potential physical problems, which probably will be listed today in the psychosomatic manifestations, of people with long-term sexual abstinence or hyperactivity, based on the theory of humors which was the main methodological tool of ancient Greek medicine. Their fundamental idea was that the four humors of the body (blood, phlegm, yellow and black bile) should be in balance. Therefore they believed that the loss and the exchange of bodily fluids during sex help body's humors to maintain their equilibrium which in turn will form the basis for the physical and mental health. Although in ancient medical texts the irrationality presented by people in the aforementioned conditions was not attributed in any of the major mental illnesses recognized in antiquity, as mania, melancholy and phrenitis, our belief is that their behavior is more suited to the characteristics of melancholy, while according to modern medicine it should be classified in the depressive disorders. We have come to this conclusion, because common characteristics of people who either did not have sexual life or was overactive, was sadness, lack of interest and hope, as well as paranoid thinking that can reach up to suicide. Regarding the psychosomatic problems, which could occur in these people, they were determined by the ancient Greek physicians in the following; continuous headaches and heaviness, dilatancy, pain, dysuria and fever. But all these symptoms would disappear when the man gained a measure sexual activity, as was categorically stated by Galen. It is striking that these ideas were maintained over time, starting already from the authors of the Hippocratic Corpus, from which the distinguished work De virginum morbis, refers indeed to women who reached the point of suicide due to the absence sexual life, hanging themselves or falling into wells and eventually passing to the works of Rufus of Ephesus, Soranus of Ephesus and Galen.","['Laios, K', 'Tsoucalas, G', 'Kontaxaki, Mu-Iota', 'Karamanou, Mu', 'Sgantzos, Mu', 'Androutsos, G']","['Laios K', 'Tsoucalas G', 'Kontaxaki MuIota', 'Karamanou Mu', 'Sgantzos Mu', 'Androutsos G']","['History of Medicine Department, Medical School, University of Athens.', 'History of Medicine Department, Medical School, University of Athens.', '1st Department of Psychiatry, University of Athens, Eginition Hospital, Athens.', 'History of Medicine Department, Medical School, University of Athens.', 'History of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.', 'History of Medicine Department, Medical School, University of Athens.']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,Greece,Psychiatriki,Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,101534363,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Greece, Ancient', 'History, Ancient', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*history', 'Mental Health/*history', 'Philosophy, Medical/*history', 'Sexual Behavior/*history']",,,,,2015/10/21 06:00,2016/04/30 06:00,['2015/10/20 06:00'],"['2015/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Psychiatriki. 2015 Jul-Sep;26(3):198-203.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The evidence that improving sleep and circadian functioning is an important pathway to mental health continues to mount. The goal of this paper is to highlight three major challenges ahead. Challenge 1 points to the possibility that comorbidity is the norm not the exception for the sleep and circadian disorders that are associated with mental disorders. Hence, the sleep and circadian problems experienced by people diagnosed with a mental disorder may not fit into the neat diagnostic categories of existing nosologies nor be adequately treated with single disorder approaches. The Sleep Health Framework and the Transdiagnostic Intervention for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction (TranS-C) are discussed as alternative approaches. Challenge 2 points to the large time lag between the development of a treatment and the availability of that treatment in routine clinical practice. This is a key reason for the emergence of implementation science, which is a flourishing, well-developed, and quickly moving field. There is an urgent need for more applications of implementation science within sleep and circadian science. Challenge 3 describes one of the greatest puzzles of our time-the need to unlock the fundamental elements of behavior change. There is potential to harness the science of behavior change to encourage widespread engagement in sleep health behavior and thereby reduce the staggering burden of sleep and circadian problems and the associated mental health problems.","['Harvey, Allison G']",['Harvey AG'],"['Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 MH120147/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'MH105513/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Sleep,Sleep,7809084,IM,"['Circadian Rhythm', 'Comorbidity', 'Humans', 'Implementation Science', '*Mental Disorders/complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Mental Health', '*Psychotic Disorders', 'Sleep']",PMC8996031,,['NOTNLM'],"['behavior change', 'circadian', 'community mental health', 'comorbidity', 'habit formation', 'implementation science', 'insomnia', 'memory for treatment', 'mental disorder', 'mental health', 'sleep', 'sleep health', 'subdiagnoses', 'transdiagnostic']",2022/01/27 06:00,2022/04/13 06:00,['2022/01/26 05:32'],"['2021/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2022/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2022/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/04/13 06:00 [medline]', '2022/01/26 05:32 [entrez]']","['6515370 [pii]', 'zsac026 [pii]', '10.1093/sleep/zsac026 [doi]']",ppublish,Sleep. 2022 Apr 11;45(4):zsac026. doi: 10.1093/sleep/zsac026.,4,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8609-0005'],,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2022.

METHODS: Research projects dedicated or partially related to mental health were identified using keywords in the CORDIS database that inventories all FP7 and CIP research projects. We then contacted projects' principal investigators to access the budget breakdown by country and performed an imputation of the distribution of funding between countries based on projects' and participants' characteristics where information was missing. RESULTS: Among the 25 783 research projects funded by the FP7 and the CIP, 215 (0.8%) were specifically dedicated to mental health and 170 (0.7%) were partially related to mental health. They received euro607.1 million representing 1.4% of FP7 total funding. Within the FP7-Health subprogramme, the projects represented 5.2% of funding. Important variations appeared across EU countries both for raw funding, which varied between euro0 and euro77M, and for funding per 100 inhabitants, which varied between euro0 and euro293. CONCLUSION: EU funding of mental health research does not match the burden incurred by mental disorders and must be increased in the next framework programme.","['Hazo, J-B', 'Gervaix, J', 'Gandre, C', 'Brunn, M', 'Leboyer, M', 'Chevreul, K']","['Hazo JB', 'Gervaix J', 'Gandre C', 'Brunn M', 'Leboyer M', 'Chevreul K']","['ECEVE, UMRS 1123, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Univ Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'ECEVE, U1123, Inserm, Paris, France.', 'AP-HP, URC-Eco, Ile-de-France, Paris, France.', 'Fondation FondaMental, French National Science Foundation, Creteil, France.', 'ECEVE, UMRS 1123, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Univ Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'ECEVE, U1123, Inserm, Paris, France.', 'AP-HP, URC-Eco, Ile-de-France, Paris, France.', 'ECEVE, UMRS 1123, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Univ Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'ECEVE, U1123, Inserm, Paris, France.', 'AP-HP, URC-Eco, Ile-de-France, Paris, France.', 'Fondation FondaMental, French National Science Foundation, Creteil, France.', 'ECEVE, UMRS 1123, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Univ Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'ECEVE, U1123, Inserm, Paris, France.', 'AP-HP, URC-Eco, Ile-de-France, Paris, France.', 'Fondation FondaMental, French National Science Foundation, Creteil, France.', 'Fondation FondaMental, French National Science Foundation, Creteil, France.', 'Translational Psychiatry, Inserm U955, Creteil, France.', 'AP-HP, Pole de psychiatrie des Hopitaux Universitaires H Mondor, DHU PePSY, Creteil, France.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Paris-Est-Creteil University (UPEC), Creteil, France.', 'ECEVE, UMRS 1123, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Univ Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'ECEVE, U1123, Inserm, Paris, France.', 'AP-HP, URC-Eco, Ile-de-France, Paris, France.', ""AP-HP, Hopital d'Enfants Robert Debre, Unite d'Epidemiologie Clinique and Inserm, CIE5, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160504,United States,Acta Psychiatr Scand,Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,0370364,IM,"['Biomedical Research/*economics/organization & administration/statistics & numerical data', 'European Union', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*economics']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['financial management', 'mental health', 'research']",2016/05/06 06:00,2017/07/19 06:00,['2016/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/acps.12584 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Psychiatr Scand. 2016 Aug;134(2):138-49. doi: 10.1111/acps.12584.

The standard forms of therapy are medication and various forms of psychotherapy. The cost of treating disease is escalating, and the health care system will never be able to meet the need for treatment in this large group of patients. Hence, development of effective self help strategies is important. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this paper, the scientific basis for promoting exercise as treatment for mental disorders is evaluated on the basis of a review of the literature. RESULTS: Beneficial psychological effects of exercise are best documented for mild to moderate forms of unipolar depression and chronic fatigue syndrome; in these disorders, exercise is an alternative to traditional forms of treatment. A therapeutic effect may also be achieved in panic and generalised anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, conversion and somatoform pain disorder, and alcohol abuse and dependence. INTERPRETATION: Beneficial effects of exercise are well documented. A simple and inexpensive approach like exercise is helpful and might be important for public health.","['Martinsen, E W']",['Martinsen EW'],"['Psykiatrisk klinikk, Sentralsjukehuset i Sogn og Fjordane, Forde. egilwm@online.no']",['nor'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,IM,"['Anxiety Disorders/therapy', 'Depression/therapy', '*Exercise', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/prevention & control/*therapy', '*Mental Health', 'Substance-Related Disorders/therapy']",,,,,2000/12/08 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/08 11:00'],"['2000/12/08 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/08 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2000 Oct 20;120(25):3054-6.,25,,,,,Fysisk aktivitet for sinnets helse.,,,,,,,46,,,,,,,,,,

Yet little is known about the prevalence and predictors of mental disorders among U.S. military Veterans living with SCI. The primary aim of this study was to present an estimate of mental disorder point prevalence in this population. The secondary aim was to examine the relationship of mental disorders to demographics, injury characteristics, and other clinically relevant features such as impairment from mental health problems and life satisfaction. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: A SCI & Disorders Center at a U.S. Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS/METHODS: Administrative and medical records of 280 Veterans who attended annual comprehensive SCI evaluations were evaluated. Demographics, injury characteristics, self-reported mental and emotional functioning (i.e. SF-8 Health Survey), and clinician-determined mental disorder diagnoses were attained. RESULTS: Overall, 40% of patients received at least one mental disorder diagnosis, most commonly depressive disorders (19%), posttraumatic stress disorder (12%), and substance or alcohol use disorders (11%). Several patient characteristics predicted mental disorders, including age, racial minority identity, non-traumatic SCI etiology, and incomplete (i.e. AIS D) vs. complete injury. Mental disorders were associated with greater impairment from health and mental health-related problems and less satisfaction with life. CONCLUSIONS: Mental disorders are common among outpatients receiving VA specialty care for SCI. These findings highlight the importance of having adequate and effective available mental health services available for Veterans with SCI.","['McDonald, Scott D', 'Mickens, Melody N', 'Goldberg-Looney, Lisa D', 'Mutchler, Brian J', 'Ellwood, Michael S', 'Castillo, Teodoro A']","['McDonald SD', 'Mickens MN', 'Goldberg-Looney LD', 'Mutchler BJ', 'Ellwood MS', 'Castillo TA']","['a Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center , Richmond, Virginia , USA.', 'b Department of Psychology , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond, Virginia , USA.', 'c Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond, Virginia , USA.', 'a Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center , Richmond, Virginia , USA.', 'b Department of Psychology , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond, Virginia , USA.', 'b Department of Psychology , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond, Virginia , USA.', 'a Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center , Richmond, Virginia , USA.', 'b Department of Psychology , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond, Virginia , USA.', 'a Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center , Richmond, Virginia , USA.', 'b Department of Psychology , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond, Virginia , USA.', 'a Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center , Richmond, Virginia , USA.', 'c Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond, Virginia , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20170313,England,J Spinal Cord Med,The journal of spinal cord medicine,9504452,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Outpatients/statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/complications/epidemiology/*psychology', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs/statistics & numerical data', 'Veterans/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC6217469,,['NOTNLM'],"['Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Social adjustment', 'Spinal cord injuries', 'Veterans']",2017/03/14 06:00,2019/11/05 06:00,['2017/03/14 06:00'],"['2017/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['1293868 [pii]', '10.1080/10790268.2017.1293868 [doi]']",ppublish,J Spinal Cord Med. 2018 Nov;41(6):691-702. doi: 10.1080/10790268.2017.1293868.

In this narrative review, we summarize the current global evidence regarding the effects of climate change on mental health. METHODS: A systematic literature search concerning the direct effects of acute extreme weather events (floods, storms, fires) and chronic stresses (heat, drought) due to climate change, as well as the indirect effects of climate change (food insecurity, migration), on the diagnoses of mental disorders, psychological distress, and psychiatric emergency admissions was carried out in PubMed and PsychInfo, and supplemented by expert selection. 1017 studies were identified, and 128 were included. RESULTS: The heterogeneity of study methods does not permit any overall estimate of effect strength. The available evidence shows that traumatic experiences due to extreme weather events increase the risk of affective and anxiety disorders, especially the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder. Heat significantly increases the morbidity and mortality attributable to mental illness, as well as the frequency of psychiatric emergencies. Persistent stressors such as drought, food insecurity, and migration owing to climate change can also be major risk factors for mental illness. CONCLUSION: The consequences of climate change are stress factors for mental health. Therefore, as global warming progresses, an increasing incidence and prevalence of mental illness is to be expected. Vulnerable groups, such as the (already) mentally ill, children, and adolescents, need to be protected. At the same time, there is a need for further systematic research on the mechanisms of action and effects of climate change on mental function.","['Walinski, Annika', 'Sander, Julia', 'Gerlinger, Gabriel', 'Clemens, Vera', 'Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas', 'Heinz, Andreas']","['Walinski A', 'Sander J', 'Gerlinger G', 'Clemens V', 'Meyer-Lindenberg A', 'Heinz A']","['German Association for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Berlin; University Hospital Ulm; Central Institute of Mental Health (CIMH), Mannheim; Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Mental Health', 'Climate Change', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology']",PMC10154789,,,,2023/01/18 06:00,2023/04/25 06:42,['2023/01/17 02:23'],"['2022/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2022/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2022/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/04/25 06:42 [medline]', '2023/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/01/17 02:23 [entrez]']","['arztebl.m2022.0403 [pii]', '10.3238/arztebl.m2022.0403 [doi]']",ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2023 Feb 24;120(8):117-124. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.m2022.0403.,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many factors have been associated with both sexual abuse and psychosis, and some mental health disorders have been identified as implied in the relationship between childhood trauma and psychosis. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to identify factors cooccurring with psychotic disorders in sexually abused youth and to determine which predict the development of psychosis in this population. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Children with a corroborated report of sexual abuse (n = 882) at a Child Protection Agency (CPA) between 2000 and 2010 and whose health data could be retrieved from public health databases were selected for this study. METHODS: A prospective matched-cohort design was used, with administrative databases from a CPA and a public health system. Logistic regressions were performed to determine which mental health diagnoses were associated with, and which predicted, psychotic disorders. RESULTS: Logistic regressions revealed that personality disorders were significantly associated with psychotic disorders whereas substance misuse disorders and intellectual disability significantly predicted psychotic disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Psychotic disorders and personality disorders appear concomitantly in sexually abused youth. Having received a substance misuse disorder diagnosis increases the risk of developing a psychotic disorder in sexually abused youth. Health professionals should be aware of those risk factors to help reduce the severity of youth sexual abuse consequences and, ultimately, prevent psychosis.","['Bourgeois, Catherine', 'Lecomte, Tania', 'McDuff, Pierre', 'Daigneault, Isabelle']","['Bourgeois C', 'Lecomte T', 'McDuff P', 'Daigneault I']","[""Universite de Montreal, Department of Psychology, 90 avenue Vincent d'Indy, Montreal, Quebec, H2V 2S9, Canada.

This study examined the relationships between family factors (Expressed Emotion [EE] and family accommodation) and psychopathology (posttraumatic stress symptoms; PTSS) in young people following a single incident trauma. Potential mediators of these relationships were also investigated. METHOD: Sixty-six parent-child dyads (aged 8-17 years) were assessed within one month of attending an Emergency Department. Self-reported PTSS and perceived EE were assessed in young people. Parents' own PTSS, mood symptoms, EE, and accommodating behaviours were also assessed. RESULTS: Cross-sectional analyses revealed that young person-perceived EE, parent-reported emotional over involvement (EOI) and accommodation behaviours significantly predicted higher PTSS in young people. The stress experienced as a consequence of EE mediated the relationship between young person-perceived EOI and PTSS in young people. Parental PTSS and anxiety were positively correlated with EOI and accommodation. Parental PTSS was not significantly associated with symptoms in young people. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that EE and accommodation are positively associated with PTSS in young people in the month following a potentially traumatic event. Understanding the child in the context of their family environment and relationships offers an important framework for making sense of and facilitating adaptive adjustment following a traumatic event.","['Goddard, E', 'Onwumere, J', 'Meiser-Stedman, R', 'Sutherland, E', 'Smith, P']","['Goddard E', 'Onwumere J', 'Meiser-Stedman R', 'Sutherland E', 'Smith P']","[""Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, United Kingdom.

Social distancing by clinicians is an integral part of the stigmatization that depends on the behavior of the patient and the level of awareness of the clinician. METHODS: The modified Bogardus Social Distance Self-Assessment Scale (BSDS) was used to evaluate the indicators of social distance phenomena. The assessment was performed by clinicians for the following groups of patients with the following mental disorders: alcohol use disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, drug addiction, epilepsy, mental retardation, schizophrenia. All statistical calculations were performed using IBM SPSS-27 software (IBM Corp. 2021, licensed to Samara State Medical University). P-value </= 0.05 was determined as significant for the between-group (PSY vs NPHP) comparisons using a nonparametric Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The study included 141 clinicians: PSY (n=20; 36.2+/-4.2 y.o.) and NPHP (n=121; 25.9+/-2.2 y.o.). The NPHP group included general practitioners (GP)/physicians (n=29; 20.6%), surgeons (n=19; 13.5%), obstetrician-gynecologists (n=26; 18.4%), neurologists (n=11; 7.8%), pediatricians (n=6; 4.3%), and other subspecialists (including urologists, tuberculosis specialists, ophthalmologists, and dermatologists) (n=30; 21.3%). The study included 141 students at the Samara State Medical University who were trained in psychiatry. An anonymous survey was conducted on the BSDS scale before and after training. Our analysis of the data showed that the social distance of clinicians in terms of coverage reaches different values depending on the mental disorder, but with common trends both before and after the psychiatry training course. Mean (SD) social distance scores recurred from 2.8 (1.3) for bipolar disorder to 5.3 (1.5) for addiction in the predevelopment group and 2.9 (1.3), 5.4 (1.4) in the group of clinicians after training, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing scores among clinicians in contemporary Russia were highest for drug addicts, and lowest for depression and bipolar disorder. Stigmatization among clinicians appears to affect the delivery of care to certain categories of patients, which requires further study. Higher social distance scores in patients with drug addiction may be associated with higher stigma and lack of compassion towards these patients. Conversely, lower rates of social distancing and the corresponding emotional acceptance of people with depression and bipolar disorder by clinicians may interfere with timely diagnosis and the availability of appropriate early, treatable care. The awareness of clinicians regarding psychopathological manifestations does not affect the level of social distance, but increases it in relation to mentally healthy individuals with normal behavior.","['Yashikhina, Anna', 'Gradinar, Anna', 'Abashkina, Anastasia']","['Yashikhina A', 'Gradinar A', 'Abashkina A']","['International Centre for Education and Research in Neuropsychiatry and Department of Psychiatry, Narcology and Psychotherapy, Samara State Medical University, 78 Nagornaya Street, 443016 Samara, Russia, a.a.yashihina@samsmu.ru.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Croatia,Psychiatr Danub,Psychiatria Danubina,9424753,IM,"['Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Physical Distancing', '*Mental Disorders/epidemiology/psychology', 'Social Stigma', 'Stereotyping', '*Substance-Related Disorders']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['destigmatization - mental disorders - clinicians - social distance - public', 'stigma']",2023/10/06 06:43,2023/10/09 06:41,['2023/10/06 04:14'],"['2023/10/09 06:41 [medline]', '2023/10/06 06:43 [pubmed]', '2023/10/06 04:14 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Psychiatr Danub. 2023 Oct;35(Suppl 2):347-352.,Suppl 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirteen studies published between 2010 and 2021 were considered eligible. A data extraction grid was designed and tested by the research team. It is not so ease to identify the most appropriate time interval to assess the mental health of newly settled refugees. All the studies selected agree on the need to carry out an initial assessment when refugees arrive in their host country. Several authors agree on the need to carry out screening at least twice during the resettlement period. However, what is less clear is the best time to perform the second screening. This scoping review mainly helped in highlighting the lack of probing data on the mental health indicators focused on during the assessment and on the optimal timeline for the assessment of refugees. Further research is needed to determine whether developmental and psychological screening is beneficial, the right time to perform the screening, and the most appropriate collection instruments and interventions.","['Maillet, Lara', 'Goudet, Anna', 'Godbout, Isabelle', 'Ntanda, Gisele Mandiangu', 'Laliberte, Genevieve', 'Desjardins, France', 'Benoit, Maryse', 'Vassiliadis, Helen-Maria', 'Loignon, Christine', 'Manceau, Luiza Maria']","['Maillet L', 'Goudet A', 'Godbout I', 'Ntanda GM', 'Laliberte G', 'Desjardins F', 'Benoit M', 'Vassiliadis HM', 'Loignon C', 'Manceau LM']","[""Ecole Nationale d'Administration publique (ENAP), 4750 av.

Perceptions and opinions of patients influence the adoption of chatbots for health care. Many studies have been conducted to assess the perceptions and opinions of patients about mental health chatbots. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no review of the evidence surrounding perceptions and opinions of patients about mental health chatbots. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a scoping review of the perceptions and opinions of patients about chatbots for mental health. METHODS: The scoping review was carried out in line with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for scoping reviews guidelines. Studies were identified by searching 8 electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE and Embase) in addition to conducting backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. In total, 2 reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data from the included studies. Data were synthesized using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Of 1072 citations retrieved, 37 unique studies were included in the review. The thematic analysis generated 10 themes from the findings of the studies: usefulness, ease of use, responsiveness, understandability, acceptability, attractiveness, trustworthiness, enjoyability, content, and comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated overall positive perceptions and opinions of patients about chatbots for mental health. Important issues to be addressed in the future are the linguistic capabilities of the chatbots: they have to be able to deal adequately with unexpected user input, provide high-quality responses, and have to show high variability in responses. To be useful for clinical practice, we have to find ways to harmonize chatbot content with individual treatment recommendations, that is, a personalization of chatbot conversations is required.","['Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa A', 'Alajlani, Mohannad', 'Ali, Nashva', 'Denecke, Kerstin', 'Bewick, Bridgette M', 'Househ, Mowafa']","['Abd-Alrazaq AA', 'Alajlani M', 'Ali N', 'Denecke K', 'Bewick BM', 'Househ M']","['Division of Information and Computing Technology, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Institute of Digital Healthcare, University of Warwick, Warwick, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Information and Computing Technology, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Bern University of Applied Science, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Leeds Institute of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Information and Computing Technology, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210113,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,IM,"['Attitude', 'Humans', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Perception', 'Telemedicine/*methods']",PMC7840290,,['NOTNLM'],"['chatbots', 'conversational agents', 'mental disorders', 'mental health', 'mobile phone', 'opinions', 'perceptions']",2021/01/14 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2021/01/13 12:10'],"['2020/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/13 12:10 [entrez]', '2021/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['v23i1e17828 [pii]', '10.2196/17828 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2021 Jan 13;23(1):e17828. doi: 10.2196/17828.,1,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7695-4626', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5691-7120', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9094-2768', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6691-396X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5752-5623', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3648-6271']",,['Conflicts of Interest: None declared.'],"['(c)Alaa A Abd-Alrazaq, Mohannad Alajlani, Nashva Ali, Kerstin Denecke, Bridgette M', 'Bewick, Mowafa Househ.

Many military veterans have a history of adverse childhood experiences, which when combined with deployment related traumas, can lead to high levels of psychopathology. Social networks can however be protective. The current study aimed to identify typologies of childhood adversity in U.S. military veterans (n = 3092) and explore relationships between the adversity typologies and PTSD, mood and anxiety disorders, utilising data from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (NESARC-III). The mediating role of quality and quantity of social networks were examined. Latent class analysis identified four adversity classes; 1) baseline, 2) household dysfunction, 3) maltreatment, and 4) multi-adversity. Individuals in the adversity classes (2-4), especially those who experienced multi-adversity had higher rates of psychopathology. The quality of social networks played an important mediating role, while quantity of networks did not. Those who experienced adversity were less likely to have supportive social networks, therefore adversity had both a direct and indirect impact on psychopathology. The findings highlight the importance of developing and maintaining social networks following military life. Recommendations include interpersonal skills training and programmes which may help them engage back into the community and enhance relationships.","['McLafferty, M', 'Ross, J', 'Waterhouse-Bradley, B', 'Armour, C']","['McLafferty M', 'Ross J', 'Waterhouse-Bradley B', 'Armour C']","['Ulster University, Cromore Road, Coleraine, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom.

Mental illness is associated with distress and problems functioning in social activities. Healthcare centres, that is, primary care, serve as the first point of contact with healthcare professionals for those young adults and provide outpatient medical and nursing care covering both physical and mental illness. OBJECTIVE: To explore experiences of primary care among young adults with mental illness. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted that followed the method of Bettany-Saltikov and McSherry. A keyword search was performed in various databases, and after a quality assessment 23 articles were included in the review. RESULTS: Young adults' experiences from primary care are described in four categories - Facing difficulties to accept help, relational preconditions, structural and organisational hindrances and satisfaction with youth-focused mental health interventions. Young adults with mental illness experience many difficulties in accessing and receiving proper help from primary care. Further, they did not believe in recovery from mental illness, and they also expressed a lack of mental health literacy. CONCLUSION: While being the first contact with healthcare professionals, primary care needs to adjust its services to address the growing group of young adults suffering from mental illness. It is necessary to provide tailored guidelines and interventions in primary care for young adults with mental illness, and the Tidal Model may improve the contacts with young adults in primary care.","['Loven Wickman, Ulrica', 'Schmidt, Manuela']","['Loven Wickman U', 'Schmidt M']","['Department of Health and Caring Sciences, Linnaeus University, Kalmar/Vaxjo, Sweden.', 'Department of Quality Improvement and Leadership, School of Health and Welfare, Jonkoping University, Jonkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20230327,Sweden,Scand J Caring Sci,Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,8804206,,"['Humans', 'Young Adult', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Health Personnel', '*Mental Disorders', 'Mental Health', 'Primary Health Care']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['mental health', 'mental illness', 'primary care', 'review', 'young adults']",2023/03/28 06:00,2023/08/17 06:43,['2023/03/27 09:22'],"['2023/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2022/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2023/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/08/17 06:43 [medline]', '2023/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/03/27 09:22 [entrez]']",['10.1111/scs.13167 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Caring Sci. 2023 Sep;37(3):628-641. doi: 10.1111/scs.13167.

Results showed small, protective effects for distance to Great Lake (beta = 0.06, p<0.001) and percentage of inland lakes (beta = -0.04, p = 0.004). Unexpectedly, shorter distance to nearest inland lake was associated with higher anxiety/mood disorder hospitalizations. The protective effects of percentage area covered by inland lakes was observed for all lake sizes.

AIMS: To assess the role impairment associated with 12-month mental disorders among incoming first-year college students within a large cross-national sample. METHODS: Web-based self-report surveys assessing the prevalence of DSM-IV mental disorders and health-related role impairment (Sheehan Disability Scale) were obtained and analyzed from 13,984 incoming first-year college students (Response = 45.5%), across 19 universities in eight countries. Impairment was assessed in the following domains: home management, work (e.g., college-related problems), close personal relationships, and social life. RESULTS: Mean age of the sample was 19.3 (SD = 0.59) and 54.4% were female. Findings showed that 20.4% of students reported any severe role impairment (10% of those without a mental disorder vs. 42.9% of those with at least one disorder, P < 0.01). In bivariate analyses, panic disorder, and mania were associated most frequently with severe impairment (60.6% and 57.5%, respectively). Students reporting three or more mental disorders had almost fivefold more frequently severe impairment relative to those without mental disorders. Multiple logistic regression showed that major depression (OR = 4.0; 95%CI = 3.3, 4.8), generalized anxiety (OR = 3.9; 95%CI = 3.1, 4.8), and panic disorder (OR = 2.9; 95%CI 2.4, 4.2) were associated with the highest odds of severe impairment. Only minimal deviations from these overall associations were found across countries. CONCLUSION: Mental disorders among first-year college students are associated with substantial role impairment. Providing preventative interventions targeting mental disorders and associated impairments is a critical need for institutions to address.","['Alonso, Jordi', 'Mortier, Philippe', 'Auerbach, Randy P', 'Bruffaerts, Ronny', 'Vilagut, Gemma', 'Cuijpers, Pim', 'Demyttenaere, Koen', 'Ebert, David D', 'Ennis, Edel', 'Gutierrez-Garcia, Raul A', 'Green, Jennifer Greif', 'Hasking, Penelope', 'Lochner, Christine', 'Nock, Matthew K', 'Pinder-Amaker, Stephanie', 'Sampson, Nancy A', 'Zaslavsky, Alan M', 'Kessler, Ronald C']","['Alonso J', 'Mortier P', 'Auerbach RP', 'Bruffaerts R', 'Vilagut G', 'Cuijpers P', 'Demyttenaere K', 'Ebert DD', 'Ennis E', 'Gutierrez-Garcia RA', 'Green JG', 'Hasking P', 'Lochner C', 'Nock MK', 'Pinder-Amaker S', 'Sampson NA', 'Zaslavsky AM', 'Kessler RC']","['Health Services Research Group, IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Pompeu Fabra University (UPF), Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER en Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Universitair Psychiatrisch Centrum-Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (UPC-KUL), Campus Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Center for Depression, Anxiety and Stress Research, McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA, USA.', 'Universitair Psychiatrisch Centrum-Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (UPC-KUL), Campus Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Health Services Research Group, IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER en Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Clinical, Neuro and Developmental Psychology, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Universitair Psychiatrisch Centrum-Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (UPC-KUL), Campus Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department for Psychology, Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'School of Psychology, Ulster University, Londonderry, United Kingdom.', 'Campus Salamanca, De La Salle Bajio University, Leon, Mexico.', 'School of Education, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'School of Psychology & Speech Pathology, Curtin University, Perth, Australia.', 'SAMRC/UCT/SU Unit on Risk & Resilience in Mental Disorders, Department of Psychiatry, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, South Africa.', 'Department of Psychology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Center for Depression, Anxiety and Stress Research, McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA, USA.', 'Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Health Services Research Group, IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['R01 DA016558/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R56MH109566/National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)/International', 'R56 MH109566/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', '11N0514N/11N0516N/1114717N/Belgian Fund for Scientific Research/International', 'R03 TW006481/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', '2014-J2140150-102905/King Baudouin Foundation/International', 'R01 MH069864/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'K05 DA015799/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH070884/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'IIT-H6U-BX-I002/Eli Lilly/International', 'R13 MH066849/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180530,United States,Depress Anxiety,Depression and anxiety,9708816,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Global Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Health Surveys/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Students/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', '*Universities/statistics & numerical data', 'World Health Organization', 'Young Adult']",PMC6123270,['NIHMS968407'],['NOTNLM'],"['anxiety disorders', 'depression', 'disability', 'drug use disorders', 'intimate relationships', 'role impairment', 'social function', 'suicide/self-harm', 'university students']",2018/05/31 06:00,2018/11/27 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/da.22778 [doi]'],ppublish,Depress Anxiety. 2018 Sep;35(9):802-814. doi: 10.1002/da.22778.

Patients with chronic conditions treated with apheresis in the outpatient setting often see their apheresis healthcare professionals more frequently than their referring physicians. In addition, many apheresis patients are on medications with psychiatric side effects such as steroids. Given the frequent interactions of apheresis practitioners with outpatients, psychiatric issues may be encountered. To highlight these issues, we report two psychiatric emergencies that occurred in an outpatient apheresis clinic. Additionally, the prevalence of mental health diagnoses in our outpatient clinic was determined to help estimate the exposure that apheresis teams have to patients with mental health diagnoses. Practical recommendations for apheresis practitioners when encountering psychiatric emergencies are summarized.","['Williams, Shelly M', 'Bobr, Aleh', 'Koepsell, Scott A']","['Williams SM', 'Bobr A', 'Koepsell SA']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20221107,United States,J Clin Apher,Journal of clinical apheresis,8216305,IM,"['Humans', '*Outpatients', '*Mental Health', 'Prevalence', 'Emergencies', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities']",PMC10099532,,['NOTNLM'],"['apheresis', 'mania', 'psychiatric disorder', 'suicidal ideation']",2022/11/09 06:00,2023/02/14 06:00,['2022/11/08 02:23'],"['2022/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2022/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2022/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/02/14 06:00 [medline]', '2022/11/08 02:23 [entrez]']","['JCA22028 [pii]', '10.1002/jca.22028 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Apher. 2023 Feb;38(1):69-72. doi: 10.1002/jca.22028.

Evidence-based, cost-effective public mental health (PMH) interventions exist to prevent mental disorders from arising, prevent associated impacts of mental disorders (including through treatment), and promote mental wellbeing and resilience. However, only a small proportion of people with mental disorders receive minimally adequate treatment. Compared with treatment, there is even less coverage of interventions to prevent the associated impacts of mental disorders, prevent mental disorders from arising, or promote mental wellbeing and resilience. This implementation failure breaches the right to health, has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and results in preventable suffering, broad impacts, and associated economic costs. In this Health Policy paper, we outline specific actions to improve the coverage of PMH interventions, including PMH needs assessments, collaborative advocacy and leadership, PMH practice to inform policy and implementation, training and improvement of population literacy, settings-based and integrated approaches, use of digital technology, maximising existing resources, focus on high-return interventions, human rights approaches, legislation, and implementation research. Increased interest in PMH in populations and governments since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic supports these actions. Improved implementation of PMH interventions can result in broad health, social, and economic impacts, even in the short-term, which support the achievement of a range of policy objectives, sustainable economic development, and recovery.","['Campion, Jonathan', 'Javed, Afzal', 'Lund, Crick', 'Sartorius, Norman', 'Saxena, Shekhar', 'Marmot, Michael', 'Allan, John', 'Udomratn, Pichet']","['Campion J', 'Javed A', 'Lund C', 'Sartorius N', 'Saxena S', 'Marmot M', 'Allan J', 'Udomratn P']","['South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK; Public Mental Health Implementation Centre, Royal College of Psychiatrists, London, UK.

Very little is known about the mental health of adult members in families left-behind. This study aimed to explore the impact of economic migration on mental health (common mental disorders) of left-behind families in Sri Lanka. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey using multistage sampling was conducted in six districts (representing 62% of outbound IMW population) of Sri Lanka. Spouses and non-spouse caregivers (those providing substantial care for children) from families of economic migrants were recruited. Adult mental health was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire. Demographic, socio-economic, migration-specific and health utilization information were gathered. RESULTS: A total of 410 IMW families were recruited (response rate: 95.1%). Both spouse and a non-spouse caregiver were recruited for 55 families with a total of 277 spouses and 188 caregivers included. Poor general health, current diagnosed illness and healthcare visit frequency was higher in the non-spouse caregiver group. Overall prevalence of common mental disorder (CMD; Depression, somatoform disorder, anxiety) was 20.7% (95%CI 16.9-24.3) with 14.4% (95%CI 10.3-18.6) among spouses and 29.8% (95%CI 23.2-36.4) among non-spouse caregivers. Prevalence of depression (25.5%; 95%CI 19.2-31.8) and somatoform disorder 11.7% (95%CI 7.0-16.3) was higher in non-spouse caregiver group. When adjusted for age and gender, non-returning IMW in family, primary education and low in-bound remittance frequency was associated with CMD for spouses while no education, poor general health and increased healthcare visits was significantly associated in the non-spouse caregiver group. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to explore specific mental health outcomes among adult left-behind family members of IMW through standardized diagnostic instruments in Sri Lanka and in South Asian region.

Still, professional help-seeking behavior is not fully understood. To conceive cultural determinants of help-seeking is crucial to reduce personal and social costs of (untreated) mental disorders. The current study investigates mental health stigma and help-seeking attitudes in a Cuban (n = 195) and a German (n = 165) sample. In a questionnaire survey we asked for attitudes towards mental illness and professional help-seeking in the general Cuban and German populations. The cultural context was associated with mental health stigma and professional help-seeking attitudes. Interestingly, Cuban participants reported stronger mental health stigma and more willingness to seek help. In multiple hierarchical regression analyses, community attitudes towards the mentally ill significantly predicted help-seeking attitudes, especially in the Cuban sample. Only in the German sample, more negative individual beliefs about mental illness predicted more self-stigma on help-seeking. Beyond that, cultural context moderated the association between mental health stigma and help-seeking attitudes with a stronger association between the measures in the German sample. However, gender did not predict help-seeking attitudes and self-stigma on help-seeking and no interactions between community attitudes, cultural context, and gender were found in the prediction of help-seeking attitudes. Similarities and differences between the samples are discussed in the light of the cultural contexts and peculiarities of the current samples.

A qualitative study.,179,10.1186/s12888-022-03812-7 [doi] 179,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 with its severe social restrictions touched the daily life of most people. While everyday social life becomes difficult for citizens with economic and cultural capital, it becomes even worse for vulnerable groups such as persons with mental health and substance use disorders, who are particularly vulnerable to social exclusion. The aim of this study is to investigate how the first COVID-19 lockdown affected the everyday life and health of persons with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders. METHODS: This qualitative study reports data from 17 individual interviews and one focus group of five participants, all with a self-reported mental health and substance use disorder. Interviews were conducted based on a semi-structured interview guide in September and October 2020 in a medium-sized local authority in Norway. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. A reference group of people with varied knowledge and experiences of the phenomenon were involved in study design, recruitment, data generation and analysis. RESULTS: The analysis identified four interrelated main themes, describing how the first lockdown affected the everyday life and health of persons suffering from a mental health and substance use disorder: (1) The COVID-19 outbreak as a perceived challenge, (2) A decline in mental health and well-being, (3) Increased substance use challenges, and (4) Diverse experiences with health and social services. The results show that people with a co-occurring disorder have challenges with digital tools and/or do not have the appropriate equipment. Further, participants were not concerned about becoming infected themselves, but infecting others. CONCLUSIONS: Persons with a mental health and substance use disorder face major challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to maintain continuous low-threshold services especially directed towards persons with co-occurring disorders during the pandemic. Furthermore, it is important to improve the digital skills of every service user or offer alternatives to digital consultations and meetings.","['Leonhardt, Marja', 'Brodahl, Morten', 'Cogan, Nicola', 'Lien, Lars']","['Leonhardt M', 'Brodahl M', 'Cogan N', 'Lien L']","['Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Concurrent Substance Abuse and Mental Health Disorders, Innlandet Hospital Trust, Post Box 104, 2381, Brumunddal, Norway. marja.leonhardt@sykehuset-innlandet.no.', 'Faculty of Health Studies, VID Specialized University, Oslo, Norway. marja.leonhardt@sykehuset-innlandet.no.', 'Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Concurrent Substance Abuse and Mental Health Disorders, Innlandet Hospital Trust, Post Box 104, 2381, Brumunddal, Norway.', 'School of Psychological Sciences & Health, University of Strathclyde, 40 George Street, G1 1QE, Glasgow, UK.', 'Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Concurrent Substance Abuse and Mental Health Disorders, Innlandet Hospital Trust, Post Box 104, 2381, Brumunddal, Norway.', 'Department of Health and Social Science, Inland Norway University of Applied Science, Elverum, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20220314,England,BMC Psychiatry,BMC psychiatry,100968559,IM,"['*COVID-19', 'Communicable Disease Control', 'Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry)', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Pandemics', '*Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology/psychology']",PMC8919911,,['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'Lockdown', 'Mental health disorder', 'Qualitative study', 'Substance use disorder', 'Thematic analysis']",2022/03/16 06:00,2022/03/25 06:00,['2022/03/15 05:36'],"['2021/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2022/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/03/15 05:36 [entrez]', '2022/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12888-022-03812-7 [pii]', '3812 [pii]', '10.1186/s12888-022-03812-7 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Psychiatry. 2022 Mar 14;22(1):179. doi: 10.1186/s12888-022-03812-7.,1,,,"['ML, MB and NC declare that they have no competing interests.

An increasing number of people tend to seek health information on the Web, and it is important to understand the factors associated with individuals' mental health information seeking. Identifying factors associated with mental health information seeking may influence the disease progression of potential patients. The planned risk information seeking model (PRISM) was developed in 2010 by integrating multiple information seeking models including the theory of planned behavior. Few studies have replicated PRISM outside the United States and no previous study has examined mental health as a personal risk in different cultures. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test the planned risk information seeking model (PRISM) in China and the United States with a chronic disease, mental illness, and two additional factors, ie, media use and cultural identity, among college students. METHODS: Data were collected in both countries using the same online survey through a survey management program (Qualtrics). In China, college instructors distributed the survey link among university students, and it was also posted on a leading social media site called Sina Weibo. In the United States, the data were collected in a college-wide survey pool in a large Northwestern university. RESULTS: The final sample size was 235 for the Chinese sample and 241 for the US sample. Media use was significantly associated with mental health information-seeking intentions in the Chinese sample (P<.001), and cultural identity was significantly associated with intentions in both samples (China: P=.02; United States: P<.001). The extended PRISM had a better model fit than the original PRISM. CONCLUSIONS: Cultural identity and media use should be considered when evaluating the process of mental health information seeking or when designing interventions to address mental health information seeking.","['Niu, Zhaomeng', 'Willoughby, Jessica Fitts', 'Mei, Jing', 'Li, Shaochun', 'Hu, Pengwei']","['Niu Z', 'Willoughby JF', 'Mei J', 'Li S', 'Hu P']","['Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.', 'Washington State University, Pullman, WA, United States.', 'AI for Healthcare, IBM Research, Beijing, China.', 'AI for Healthcare, IBM Research, Beijing, China.', 'AI for Healthcare, IBM Research, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200511,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Information Seeking Behavior/*ethics', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Students/*psychology', 'Universities', 'Young Adult']",PMC7275260,,['NOTNLM'],"['cross-cultural comparison', 'information seeking behavior', 'mental health']",2020/05/23 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/05/23 06:00'],"['2019/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['v22i5e15817 [pii]', '10.2196/15817 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2020 May 11;22(5):e15817. doi: 10.2196/15817.,5,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9906-5992', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1118-9502', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5179-5128', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2032-1453', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5974-7932']",,['Conflicts of Interest: None declared.'],"['(c)Zhaomeng Niu, Jessica Fitts Willoughby, Jing Mei, Shaochun Li, Pengwei Hu.', 'Originally published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research', '(http://www.jmir.org), 11.05.2020.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, up until now there has been little examination of the groups that autistic people may belong to, and how these groups may influence their mental health. This survey-based study investigated whether autistic adults answer questions about social groups in a similar way to non-autistic non-autistic adults, including the types and number of social groups they may belong to, and whether these are associated with depression, anxiety and positive traits of mental well-being. In total, 184 autistic adults completed an online survey with questionnaires about their demographics, social groups and mental health. The results found that autistic adults reported on their social groups similarly to non-autistic people. There was a variety in the types and numbers of groups that autistic adults identified with. Some participants reported having no groups that they identified with, whereas others reported up to four groups. These included other autistic people, their family, friends, work colleagues and activity clubs among others. Autistic adults who felt connected with more groups reported better mental well-being. Feelings of connection to other autistic people and the family were also associated with better mental well-being. These results show that it is important for autistic people to be given opportunity to be part of groups that are meaningful to them, as this may be beneficial for their mental health.","['Maitland, Cameron A', 'Rhodes, Sinead', ""O'Hare, Anne"", 'Stewart, Mary E']","['Maitland CA', 'Rhodes S', ""O'Hare A"", 'Stewart ME']","['University of Edinburgh, UK.', 'Heriot-Watt University, UK.', 'University of Edinburgh, UK.', 'University of Edinburgh, UK.', 'Heriot-Watt University, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210519,England,Autism,Autism : the international journal of research and practice,9713494,IM,"['Adult', 'Anxiety', '*Autism Spectrum Disorder', '*Autistic Disorder', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Social Identification']",PMC8323333,,['NOTNLM'],"['adults', 'autism spectrum disorders', 'depression', 'mental health', 'social cognition and social behaviour', 'social identity', 'well-being']",2021/05/21 06:00,2021/08/14 06:00,['2021/05/20 05:31'],"['2021/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/20 05:31 [entrez]']","['10.1177_13623613211004328 [pii]', '10.1177/13623613211004328 [doi]']",ppublish,Autism. 2021 Aug;25(6):1771-1783. doi: 10.1177/13623613211004328.

The patient must already be receiving treatment for mental disorder. The section lasts for up to 6 h. Section 5(4) is over 30 years old; however, there is relatively little literature exploring its use. Existing literature has limited itself to surveys and audits investigating: nurses' opinions of Section 5(4); nurses' knowledge of Section 5(4); and trends associated with the implementation of Section 5(4). The literature review suggests that what is known about the implementation of Section 5(4) is incomplete. For example, there are no accounts of how and why the holding power is implemented from both a nursing and patient perspective. Section 5(4) (nurse's holding power) of the Mental Health Act 1983 in England and Wales accounts for 10% (n = 1714) of all detentions after admission to hospital. It is followed by further detention in 66% of cases and may require nurses to restrain, seclude or closely observe the patient to prevent them harming themselves and/or others. To conduct a literature review of empirical articles concerning the implementation of Section 5(4), a literature search was undertaken in ASSIA, British Nursing Index, Medline, PsycINFO and Lawtel, using a combination of the keywords 'Section 5(4)', 'nurse's holding powers', 'holding powers', 'Mental Health Act 1983', 'MHA', 'compulsory detention', 'formal detention', 'emergency psychiatric interventions', 'containment interventions' and 'involuntary commitment'. Twenty-five articles were included in the review. Existing literature has focused on surveys and audits investigating: nurses' opinions of Section 5(4); nurses' knowledge of Section 5(4); and trends associated with the implementation of Section 5(4). While this literature has provided some insights into the implementation of Section 5(4), it is clear that what is known about its use is incomplete.

However, these problems are poorly understood. AIMS: To identify patterns (profiles) of mental health in this population and to analyze the associations between profiles and child characteristics. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Parents of 119 children with DCD completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Results indicated that a four latent class was the best model. Profile 1 was defined as ""no"" mental health problems (n = 28; 24 %), Profile 2 was defined as ""hyperactivity"" problems (n = 53; 43.3 %), for clinical indications for hyperactivity, Profile 3 was defined as ""internalizing"" problems (n = 8; 7.3 %), for clinical indications for emotional symptoms and peer problems, and Profile 4 was defined as ""internalizing and externalizing problems"" (n = 30; 25.4 %), for clinical indications for problems in both areas. In addition, having a co-occurring disorder, accommodation plans, and using medications were associated with the profiles. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: There are distinct and unique profiles that children with DCD exhibit. Clinicians can use these profiles to better understand the presentation of mental health symptoms in this population and provide adequate services or support if mental health difficulties are present.","['Pimenta, Ricardo Almeida', 'Fuchs, Chadwick', 'Fears, Nicholas E', 'Mariano, Marilia', 'Tamplain, Priscila']","['Pimenta RA', 'Fuchs C', 'Fears NE', 'Mariano M', 'Tamplain P']","['Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil.', 'University of Texas at Arlington, United States.', 'Louisiana State University, United States.', ""Bishop's University, Canada."", 'University of Texas at Arlington, United States.

To help mitigate the impact of PPTEs on PSP mental health, many PSP agencies have implemented diverse peer support despite limited empirical evidence. The current study was designed to expand the empirical evidence surrounding peer support by investigating one of the most widely used and structured peer support resources: Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM). Specifically, the current study with integrated firefighters and paramedics assessed (a) the prevalence of mental disorders; (b) perceptions of high fidelity CISM peer support; and (c) the comparative associations of CISM with high fidelity (n = 91) versus unknown fidelity (n = 60) versus no CISM (n = 64) and mental health. Results indicated that (a) mental disorders are prevalent among PSP irrespective of gender, age, and years of service; (b) participants perceived CISM peer support as offering beneficial and valuable tools (e.g., skills and coping strategies); and (c) high fidelity CISM environments offer some mental health benefits to individuals who screen positive for alcohol use disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Overall, the current study offers novel information that can inform future directions for evidence-based peer support and policy decisions designed to support the mental health of PSP.","['Price, Jill A B', 'Landry, Caeleigh A', 'Sych, Jeff', 'McNeill, Malcolm', 'Stelnicki, Andrea M', 'Asmundson, Aleiia J N', 'Carleton, R Nicholas']","['Price JAB', 'Landry CA', 'Sych J', 'McNeill M', 'Stelnicki AM', 'Asmundson AJN', 'Carleton RN']","['Department of Psychology, University of Regina, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Regina, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.', 'Sych & Associates Psychological Services, Edmonton, AB T5M 2P6, Canada.', 'Sych & Associates Psychological Services, Edmonton, AB T5M 2P6, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Regina, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Regina, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20220420,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,IM,"['Allied Health Personnel', '*Firefighters', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Psychotherapy', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology']",PMC9100761,,['NOTNLM'],"['Critical Incident Stress Management', 'mental disorders', 'mental health', 'peer support', 'public safety personnel']",2022/05/15 06:00,2022/05/18 06:00,['2022/05/14 01:12'],"['2022/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2022/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2022/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/05/14 01:12 [entrez]', '2022/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph19094976 [pii]', 'ijerph-19-04976 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph19094976 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2022 Apr 20;19(9):4976. doi: 10.3390/ijerph19094976.,9,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5179-6377', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5709-5053', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4519-0368', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6083-8935']",,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The changing geopolitical landscape has led to its resurgence in recent years. The public rejection of traditional forms of torture that rely on the infliction of physical pain has paradoxically increased the reliance on psychological methods of torture. This critical commentary aims to define and characterize psychological torture (PT) while exploring practical, legal, ethical and therapeutic implications relevant to clinicians and policymakers. Psychological torture comes in a range of forms. It is being increasingly justified and adopted by legitimate authorities in the name of national security. The emphasis on the avoidance of physical pain leads to the assumption that PT does not produce the levels of suffering and harm that are associated with physically violent forms of torture. This same assumption has allowed for the implication of mental health professionals in theorizing and providing legitimacy for the actions of perpetrators. Psychological torture is still poorly defined with limited understanding of its long-term psychiatric impact on those who are subjected to it. The role of mental health professionals in preventing or addressing psychological torture remains ambiguous and needs to be reinforced.","['El-Khoury, Joseph', 'Haidar, Riwa', 'Barkil-Oteo, Andres']","['El-Khoury J', 'Haidar R', 'Barkil-Oteo A']","['Department of Psychiatry, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Psychiatry, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Psychiatry, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200926,England,Int J Soc Psychiatry,The International journal of social psychiatry,0374726,IM,"['Europe', 'Health Personnel', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic', '*Torture']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Torture', 'human rights', 'post-traumatic stress disorder', 'psychological torture', 'trauma']",2020/09/29 06:00,2021/10/12 06:00,['2020/09/28 08:42'],"['2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/28 08:42 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0020764020961800 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Soc Psychiatry. 2021 Aug;67(5):500-506. doi: 10.1177/0020764020961800.

AIMS: To determine the distribution of debt across sociodemographic and socioeconomic statuses; to examine whether debt influences CMD recovery over time; and to determine the effects of episodic and/or long-term debt and CMD on MHSU outcomes. METHODS: Data were collected from phase 1 (N = 1698) and phase 2 (N = 1052) of the South East London Community Health (SELCoH) study, a population-based survey. RESULTS: 37.2% of participants who reported debt at SELCoH 1 and 46.6% at SELCoH 2 experienced concurrent CMD. Those with concurrent exposure to debt and CMD at SELCoH 1 were at greater risk of CMD at SELCoH 2. Debt accumulation was strongly associated with CMD cross-sectionally; however, this somewhat dissipated over time. Reporting any debt at SELCoH 2 or debt at both time-points were strongly associated with MHSU in the past year in the fully adjusted model adjusting for prior mental health. CONCLUSIONS: More focus is needed on concurrent exposure to debt and CMD with regards to subsequent psychological impact and consequences for MHSU.","['Gunasinghe, Cerisse', 'Gazard, Billy', 'Aschan, Lisa', 'MacCrimmon, Shirlee', 'Hotopf, Matthew', 'Hatch, Stephani L']","['Gunasinghe C', 'Gazard B', 'Aschan L', 'MacCrimmon S', 'Hotopf M', 'Hatch SL']","[""a Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London , London , UK and."", ""a Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London , London , UK and."", ""a Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London , London , UK and."", ""a Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London , London , UK and."", ""a Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London , London , UK and."", 'b South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London , UK.', ""a Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London , London , UK and.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181110,England,J Ment Health,"Journal of mental health (Abingdon, England)",9212352,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Facilities and Services Utilization', 'Female', 'Help-Seeking Behavior', 'Humans', 'London', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*economics/*psychology', 'Mental Health/economics', 'Mental Health Services/*economics', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['common mental disorders', 'debt', 'help-seeking', 'mental health', 'service use']",2018/11/13 06:00,2019/05/22 06:00,['2018/11/13 06:00'],"['2018/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09638237.2018.1487541 [doi]'],ppublish,J Ment Health. 2018 Dec;27(6):520-528. doi: 10.1080/09638237.2018.1487541.

AIMS: To investigate the long-term course and predictors of psychological distress among Vietnamese refugees in Norway. METHOD: Eighty Vietnamese refugees, 57% of the original cohort previously interviewed in 1982 (T(1)) and 1985 (T(2)), completed a self-report questionnaire prior to a semi-structured interview. Mental health was measured using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). RESULTS: The SCL-90-R mean Global Severity Index (GSI) decreased significantly from T(1) to T(3) (2005-6), but there was no significant change in the percentage reaching threshold scores (GSI =1.00). Trauma-related mental disorder on arrival and the trajectory of symptoms over the first 3 years of resettlement predicted mental health after 23 years. CONCLUSIONS: Although the self-reported psychological distress decreased significantly over time, a substantial higher proportion of the refugee group still remained reaching threshold scores after 23 years of resettlement compared with the Norwegian population. The data suggest that refugees reaching threshold scores on measures such as the SCL-90-R soon after arrival warrant comprehensive clinical assessment.","['Vaage, Aina Basilier', 'Thomsen, Per Hove', 'Silove, Derrick', 'Wentzel-Larsen, Tore', 'Van Ta, Thong', 'Hauff, Edvard']","['Vaage AB', 'Thomsen PH', 'Silove D', 'Wentzel-Larsen T', 'Van Ta T', 'Hauff E']","['Centre for Child and Adolescent Mental Health, University of Bergen, and Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Stavanger University Hospital, Stavanger, Norway. aina.b.vaage@lyse.net']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Psychiatry,The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,0342367,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Refugees/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Vietnam/ethnology']",,,,,2010/02/02 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2010/02/02 06:00'],"['2010/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0007125000251593 [pii]', '10.1192/bjp.bp.108.059139 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Psychiatry. 2010 Feb;196(2):122-5. doi: 10.1192/bjp.bp.108.059139.,2,,,,,,,,['Br J Psychiatry. 2010 Mar;196:248'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article presents the development and psychometric evaluation of the Mental Help Seeking Attitudes Scale (MHSAS), designed to measure respondents' overall evaluation (unfavorable vs. favorable) of their seeking help from a mental health professional. In Study 1 (N = 857 United States adults), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item response theory (IRT) analysis were used to identify an optimal set of 9 items that demonstrated initial evidence of internal consistency, unidimensionality, and strong measurement equivalence/invariance (ME/I) across gender, past help-seeking experience, and psychological distress. Initial convergent evidence of validity was demonstrated via theoretically anticipated relationships between the MHSAS and key variables in the help-seeking nomological network (e.g., subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, intention, public stigma, self-stigma, anticipated risks and benefits, gender, previous help seeking). Initial incremental evidence of validity was demonstrated when the MHSAS demonstrated the ability to account for unique variance in help-seeking intention, beyond that accounted for by the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help-Short Form scale (ATSPPH-SF) and the Psychological Openness subscale of the Inventory of Attitudes Toward Seeking Mental Health Services (IASMHS-PO). Study 2 (N = 207 United States adults at Times 1 and 2) provided initial evidence of test-retest reliability over a 3-week period. The MHSAS offers mental health professionals a new tool for measuring attitudes that may avoid limitations of current help seeking-attitudes measures (e.g., construct-irrelevant variance).

The amendments were intended to remove perceived obstacles to the detention of high risk patients with personality disorders (PDs), sexual deviance and learning disabilities (LDs). The AMEND study aimed to test the hypothesis that the implementation of these changes would lead to an increase in numbers or proportions of patients with these conditions who would be assessed and detained under the MHA 2007. METHOD: A prospective, quantitative study of MHA assessments undertaken between July-October 2008-11 at three English sites. Data were collected from local forms used for MHA assessment documentation and patient electronic databases. RESULTS: The total number of assessments in each four month period of data collection varied: 1034 in 2008, 1042 in 2009, 1242 in 2010 and 1010 in 2011 (n = 4415). Of the assessments 65.6% resulted in detention in 2008, 71.3% in 2009, 64.7% in 2010 and 63.5% in 2011. There was no significant change in the odds ratio of detention when comparing the 2008 assessments against the combined 2009, 2010 and 2011 data (OR = 1.025, Fisher's exact Chi (2) p = 0.735). Only patients with LD and 'any other disorder or disability of the mind' were significantly more likely to be assessed under the MHA post implementation (Chi(2) = 5.485, P = 0.018; Chi(2) = 24.962, P > 0.001 respectively). There was no significant change post implementation in terms of the diagnostic category of detained patients. CONCLUSIONS: In the first three years post implementation, the 2007 Act did not facilitate the compulsory care of patients with PDs, sexual deviance and LDs.","['Singh, Swaran P', 'Paul, Moli', 'Parsons, Helen', 'Burns, Tom', 'Tyrer, Peter', 'Fazel, Seena', 'Deb, Shoumitro', 'Islam, Zoebia', 'Rugkasa, Jorun', 'Gajwani, Ruchika', 'Thana, Lavanya', 'Crawford, Michael J']","['Singh SP', 'Paul M', 'Parsons H', 'Burns T', 'Tyrer P', 'Fazel S', 'Deb S', 'Islam Z', 'Rugkasa J', 'Gajwani R', 'Thana L', 'Crawford MJ']","['Mental Health and Wellbeing, Warwick Medical School, Coventry, UK.', 'Mental Health and Wellbeing, Warwick Medical School, Coventry, UK. moli.paul@covwarkpt.nhs.uk.', 'Stratford CAMHS, Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust, Stratford-upon-Avon, UK. moli.paul@covwarkpt.nhs.uk.', 'Division of Health Sciences, Warwick Medical School, Coventry, UK.', 'University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Imperial College London, Centre for Psychiatry, Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, London, UK.', 'University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Imperial College London, Centre for Psychiatry, Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, London, UK.', 'LOROS (The Leicestershire and Rutland Hospice), Leicester, UK.', 'Health Services Research Unit, Akershus University Hospital, Akershus, Norway.', 'Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Imperial College London, Centre for Psychiatry, Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, London, UK.', 'Imperial College London, Centre for Psychiatry, Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['095806/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '202836/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'NIHR-PR-MA-0208-10,007/Department of Health [UK]/International']",['Journal Article'],20170710,England,BMC Psychiatry,BMC psychiatry,100968559,IM,"['Adult', 'Commitment of Mentally Ill/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'England', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*diagnostic imaging', 'Mental Health/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Personality Disorders/diagnosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Qualitative Research', 'Wales']",PMC5504787,,['NOTNLM'],"['Act', 'Involuntary', 'Law', 'Mental health', 'Psychiatry']",2017/07/12 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2017/07/12 06:00'],"['2017/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12888-017-1391-2 [pii]', '1391 [pii]', '10.1186/s12888-017-1391-2 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Psychiatry. 2017 Jul 10;17(1):246. doi: 10.1186/s12888-017-1391-2.,1,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2398-4308'],,"['Ethical approval was independently gained from the West Midlands Research Ethics', 'Committee (WMREC Ref 08/H1208/44) and Birmingham City Council Ethics Committee.', 'Data was collected on Mental Health Act assessments rather than participants.', 'CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION: Not applicable.

A systematic search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Cochrane was conducted, using PRISMA guidelines. The search resulted in 17 articles to include in this review. A combined adjusted odds ratios of 1.65 (95% CI = 1.34, 2.05) for infant sleep problems leading to subsequent mental health symptoms resulted. A variety of outcome measures for both poor infant sleep and mental health symptoms/diagnosis were used, limiting the generalisability of results.

One of the objectives of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) is to reduce the financial burden for those with intensive mental health service needs. Few researchers to date have examined MHPAEA's effects on children with mental health conditions and those with particularly high mental health expenditures. METHODS: A difference-in-differences approach was used to compare commercially insured children ages 3 to 18 years (in 2008) who were continuously enrolled in plans newly subject to parity under MHPAEA to children continuously enrolled in plans never subject to parity. Data included inpatient, outpatient, and pharmaceutical claims for 2008-2012 from 3 national commercial insurers. We examined annual mental health service use and spending outcomes. RESULTS: Among children with mental health conditions who were enrolled in plans subject to parity, parity was associated with $140 (95% confidence interval: -$196 to -$84) lower average annual out-of-pocket (OOP) mental health spending than expected given changes in the comparison group. Among children who were >/=85th percentile in total mental health spending, parity was associated with $234 (-$391 to -$76) lower average annual OOP mental health spending. CONCLUSIONS: MHPAEA was associated with increased financial protection on average for children with mental health conditions and among those at the higher end of the spending distribution. However, estimated reductions in OOP spending were likely too modest to have substantially reduced financial burden on families of children with particularly high mental health expenditures.","['Kennedy-Hendricks, Alene', 'Epstein, Andrew J', 'Stuart, Elizabeth A', 'Haffajee, Rebecca L', 'McGinty, Emma E', 'Busch, Alisa B', 'Huskamp, Haiden A', 'Barry, Colleen L']","['Kennedy-Hendricks A', 'Epstein AJ', 'Stuart EA', 'Haffajee RL', 'McGinty EE', 'Busch AB', 'Huskamp HA', 'Barry CL']","['Departments of Health Policy and Management and alene@jhu.edu.', 'Center for Mental Health and Addiction Policy Research, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Leonard Davis Institute for Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Departments of Health Policy and Management and.', 'Center for Mental Health and Addiction Policy Research, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Mental Health, and.', 'Department of Health Management and Policy, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Departments of Health Policy and Management and.', 'Center for Mental Health and Addiction Policy Research, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Mental Health, and.', 'McLean Hospital, Belmont, Massachusetts; and.', 'Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Departments of Health Policy and Management and.', 'Center for Mental Health and Addiction Policy Research, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Leonard Davis Institute for Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Mental Health, and.']",['eng'],['R01 MH093414/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Health Expenditures/trends', 'Humans', 'Insurance Claim Reporting/economics/trends', 'Insurance, Health/*economics/trends', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*economics/epidemiology/therapy', 'Mental Health/economics/trends', 'Mental Health Services/*economics/trends', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC6317554,,,,2018/07/25 06:00,2019/05/03 06:00,['2018/07/25 06:00'],"['2018/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['peds.2017-2618 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2017-2618 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2018 Aug;142(2):e20172618. doi: 10.1542/peds.2017-2618.,2,,,"['POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Dr Epstein is an employee of Medicus Economics,', 'LLC, a consulting firm with clients in the biopharmaceutical industry; the other', 'authors have indicated they have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.']",['Copyright (c) 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They threaten harm or death to a large group of people; cause disruption of services and social networks and a communal loss of resources; and involve identifiable mental and physical health outcomes, among those affected. While majority of individuals who experience a traumatic event due to natural disasters do not develop psychopathology, natural disasters can threaten our psychological well-being in many ways and they can result in both short and long-term psychological distress and thus create a significant burden of mental health conditions on individuals and the community affected by them. In this paper we provide a narrative review that focuses on the mental health effects of natural disasters. We discuss effective, evidence-based interventions that can help enhance the sense of safety, hope, and optimism, as well as serve to promote social connectedness for those who are impacted. We describe how these interventions, developed by keeping in mind the cultural context and the needs of the community, can be provided pre, peri and post-disaster period to improve the adverse mental health effects of the disaster.","['Saeed, Sy Atezaz', 'Gargano, Steven P']","['Saeed SA', 'Gargano SP']","['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA.', 'Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20220215,England,Int Rev Psychiatry,"International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)",8918131,IM,"['*Disasters', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Natural Disasters', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/psychology/therapy']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Natural disasters', 'psychiatric disorders', 'psychopathology', 'resilience', 'stress diathesis model', 'trauma or stressor-related disorder']",2022/05/19 06:00,2022/05/21 06:00,['2022/05/18 13:03'],"['2022/05/18 13:03 [entrez]', '2022/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/09540261.2022.2037524 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Rev Psychiatry. 2022 Feb;34(1):16-25. doi: 10.1080/09540261.2022.2037524.

The purpose of this study was to identify rates of mental health disorders in patients with patellofemoral pain (PFP) and determine differences by sex and whether mental health copresence influences outcomes. METHODS: Eligible patients with a new PFP diagnosis were categorized according to sex and presence of mental health disorders. Outcomes included odds of mental health disorder before/after initial PFP diagnosis based on sex, and knee-related health care use between patients with/without mental health disorders. RESULTS: In 81,832 individuals with PFP (71.1% men; mean age 33; 91.5% active duty), copresence of any mental health disorders was common (18% men; 28% women). Women had more depression and anxiety; men had more post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse disorders. Concurrent mental health disorders after initial PFP diagnosis resulted in higher medical costs and odds of a recurrence (OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.20, 1.28; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Mental health disorders are common in military service members seeking care for patellofemoral pain. Differences in prevalence vary by sex, and presence of mental health disorders adversely affected long-term health care outcomes.","['Rhon, Daniel I', 'Roy, Tanja C', 'Oh, Robert C', 'Young, Jodi L']","['Rhon DI', 'Roy TC', 'Oh RC', 'Young JL']","['From the Primary Care Musculoskeletal Research Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, JBSA Fort Sam Houston, TX (DIR, JLY); Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD (DIR); U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Natick, MA (DIR, TCR): Department of Family Medicine, Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA (RCO): Doctor of Science in Physical Therapy Program, Bellin College, Green Bay, WI (DIR, JLY). daniel.i.rhon.ctr@mail.mil.', 'From the Primary Care Musculoskeletal Research Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, JBSA Fort Sam Houston, TX (DIR, JLY); Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD (DIR); U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Natick, MA (DIR, TCR): Department of Family Medicine, Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA (RCO): Doctor of Science in Physical Therapy Program, Bellin College, Green Bay, WI (DIR, JLY).', 'From the Primary Care Musculoskeletal Research Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, JBSA Fort Sam Houston, TX (DIR, JLY); Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD (DIR); U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Natick, MA (DIR, TCR): Department of Family Medicine, Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA (RCO): Doctor of Science in Physical Therapy Program, Bellin College, Green Bay, WI (DIR, JLY).', 'From the Primary Care Musculoskeletal Research Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, JBSA Fort Sam Houston, TX (DIR, JLY); Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD (DIR); U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Natick, MA (DIR, TCR): Department of Family Medicine, Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA (RCO): Doctor of Science in Physical Therapy Program, Bellin College, Green Bay, WI (DIR, JLY).']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Am Board Fam Med,Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,101256526,IM,"['Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health', '*Military Personnel', '*Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome/diagnosis/epidemiology', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Connective Tissue', 'Gender Differences', 'Health Services Research', 'Mental Health', 'Military Medicine', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome', 'Veterans Health']",2021/04/10 06:00,2021/09/11 06:00,['2021/04/09 05:49'],"['2020/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/09 05:49 [entrez]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['34/2/328 [pii]', '10.3122/jabfm.2021.02.200323 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Board Fam Med. 2021 Mar-Apr;34(2):328-337. doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2021.02.200323.,2,,,['Conflict of interest: None declared.'],['(c) Copyright 2021 by the American Board of Family Medicine.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The scarcity of these programs leads us to deepen students' perspective in order to boost the establishment of such sessions. Indeed, this type of prevention plan can improve the access to care and reduce the impact of such disorders. METHODOLOGY: We have developed a standardized questionnaire to be filled online by students between the ages of 18 and 25 years, reached using Facebook pages of student associations of universities from different regions of France. RESULTS: From the 3rd to the 20th of July 2017, 1852 students filled in the questionnaire. In total, 1672 (90%) of the young adults had not experienced mental health educational programs in their school career. However, 1652 (90%) requested that these programs be a part of their academic career. The majority of the young adults (n=590, 56%) would have chosen a psychologist as leader for these programs, preferably (>80%) in a discussion around a difficult imaginary situation, using role-playing or a board game. Furthermore, 1067 (57%) young adults reported having felt the need to talk to someone about mental health during their school career. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study highlights the lack of mental health educational programs in schools and the need expressed by students themselves. It suggests directions to think about how to develop these mental health preventive programs, evoking their limits and advantages.","['Bezard, G', 'Rouquette, A']","['Bezard G', 'Rouquette A']","[""Detection et intervention precoces des pathologies psychiatriques emergentes du jeune adulte et de l'adolescent, faculte de medecine, 15 rue de l'Ecole de Medecine, 75006 Paris, France.

This study used an archival data set of mental health patients that employed a multimethod design. A total of 214 individuals (and their nominated informants) completed various personality inventories indexing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-Fifth edition traditional and Alternative Model of Personality Disorders (AMPD) diagnostic criteria for OCPD, as well as other individual AMPD personality traits deemed conceptually relevant to the FFOCI. The results were generally quite supportive of construct validity. They showed that FFOCI scale scores converged with traditional measures of OCPD and AMPD-OCPD traits and impairment in a conceptually expected manner, with a few exceptions. Overall, it was clear from these findings that the FFOCI takes a broader and more comprehensive approach to the assessment of obsessive-compulsive than traditional Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and AMPD operationalizations.","['Hall-Jones, Miro', 'Liggett, Jacqueline', 'Sellbom, Martin']","['Hall-Jones M', 'Liggett J', 'Sellbom M']","['University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Australian National University, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia.', 'Private psychology practice.', 'University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20201217,United States,Assessment,Assessment,9431219,IM,"['Compulsive Personality Disorder/diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Humans', '*Mental Health', '*Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/diagnosis', 'Personality Inventory']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['DSM-5', 'OCPD', 'alternative model for personality disorders', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'personality disorder', 'personality traits']",2020/12/19 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/12/18 05:27'],"['2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/18 05:27 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1073191120976860 [doi]'],ppublish,Assessment. 2021 Jun;28(4):1147-1158. doi: 10.1177/1073191120976860.

Mental health was measured by the Ochanomizu University Health Examination, which includes mental health scales composed of somatic symptoms, eating disorders, depression, interpersonal relationships, powerlessness, and impulsiveness; self-resilience; familial relationships; friendships; a feeling of gloom during the previous month; current well-being; and counseling. The results of this study were as follows: first, Japanese students experienced more difficulties in interpersonal relationships and experienced more feelings of powerlessness than Korean and Chinese students. Korean students were vulnerable to somatic symptoms and impulsiveness, whereas Chinese students experienced more depression than Korean and Japanese students. Second, more female students were in the poor mental health group than male students. Third, Japanese female students ranked the lowest of all groups for the Resilience Index scores. Fourth, when in need of counseling, students solicited advice from teachers (classroom teachers, health teachers or club teachers) about their study-related problems, and asked for advice from friends regarding problems or worries about peer and family relations.

METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed to students from 4th-9th grade diagnosed with chronic diseases at Osaka Medical College Hospital and their parents or caregivers. Questionnaires from 286 families were returned by mail after the schools reopened. The students were divided into the ""psychosomatic disorder"" group (group P, n = 42), the ""developmental disorder"" group (group D, n = 89), and the ""other disease"" group (group O, n = 155). Using students' self-reports on the Questionnaire for Triage and Assessment with 30 items, we assessed the proportion of students with a high risk of psychosomatic disorder in three groups. We investigated how the students requiring the support of somatic symptom (SS) felt about school during school closure. Further, using parents' and caregivers' answers, SS scores were calculated before and during school closure and after school reopening. RESULTS: The proportion of students with a high risk of developing psychosomatic disorder increased in all groups. For the students in Group P, the response ""I did not want to think about school"" indicated an increase in SS scores, and for the students in Group O, ""I wanted to get back to school soon"" indicated a decrease. Furthermore, especially in Group P students, SS scores decreased transiently during school closure and increased after school reopening. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of school closure on mental health differed depending on students' diagnoses and feelings about school during school closures.","['Hayano, Chiaki', 'Shimakawa, Shuichi', 'Fukui, Miho', 'Yoshida, Seiji', 'Tsuda-Kitahara, Hikaru', 'Ashida, Akira']","['Hayano C', 'Shimakawa S', 'Fukui M', 'Yoshida S', 'Tsuda-Kitahara H', 'Ashida A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical Hospital, Takatsuki, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical Hospital, Takatsuki, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical Hospital, Takatsuki, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Education, Faculty of Education, Osaka Ohtani University, Tondabayashi, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical Hospital, Takatsuki, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical Hospital, Takatsuki, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical Hospital, Takatsuki, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,IM,"['COVID-19/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Developmental Disabilities/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Pandemics', 'Psychophysiologic Disorders/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', '*Schools', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'Japan', 'chronic disease', 'mental health', 'return to school']",2022/07/28 06:00,2022/07/30 06:00,['2022/07/27 12:52'],"['2021/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2022/07/27 12:52 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.15131 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2022 Jan;64(1):e15131. doi: 10.1111/ped.15131.,1,,,,['(c) 2022 Japan Pediatric Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We synthesised quantitative studies reporting outcomes for people with a 'personality disorder' diagnosis using crisis and acute mental health services. METHODS: We searched OVID Medline, PsycInfo, PsycExtra, Web of Science, HMIC, CINAHL Plus, Clinical Trials and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that reported at least one clinical or social outcome following use of crisis and acute care for people given a 'personality disorder' diagnosis. We performed a narrative synthesis of evidence for each model of care found. RESULTS: We screened 16,953 records resulting in 35 studies included in the review. Studies were published between 1987-2022 and conducted in 13 countries. Six studies were RCTs, the remainder were non randomised controlled studies or cohort studies reporting change over time. Studies were found reporting outcomes for crisis teams, acute hospital admission, acute day units, brief admission, crisis-focused psychotherapies in a number of settings, Mother and Baby units, an early intervention service and joint crisis planning.

Based on existing literature, we hypothesized that undocumented patients would have fewer psychiatric admissions than documented patients. We reviewed 2019 inpatient admission data for Hispanic/Latino patients at an urban hospital. Patients were coded as undocumented or documented using insurance proxies. Multivariable logistic regression was used to report odds ratio of admission diagnoses of interest by documentation status. There were no significant differences in psychiatric admissions between undocumented patients (2.1%) and documented patients (2.8%) (p=.77). Compared with documented counterparts, undocumented patients were more likely to be admitted for alcohol-related disorders (AOR=1.59, 95%CI=1.31-1.93) but had lower proportions of admission for substance-related disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and suicide and intentional self-inflicted injury among others.

We analyzed pre-treatment self-report questionnaires and clinical interviews from 318 refugees with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a specialized mental health clinic. Results show that twice as many females reported exposure to family violence (p = .001) and sexual abuse (p = .004), whereas men were at least three times as likely to report exposure to torture (p <0.001), imprisonment (p < .001), and combat (p < .001). Men reported exposure to more trauma types (p < .001). Women reported more depression (p = .001), anxiety (p = .008) and somatization (p = 0.001), whereas men were diagnosed significantly more with enduring personality change after catastrophic experience (p < .001). Additionally, trauma burden was significantly associated with PTSD (p = .001) and depression (p = .039) scores for women but not men, and imprisonment was associated with a higher PTSD score in women (p = 0.037) but not men. Our findings highlight sex differences in trauma exposure and symptomatology in trauma-affected refugees in host countries, that should be considered when developing mental health interventions for this underserved population.","['Mundy, Sara Skriver', 'Foss, Sara Louise Wilms', 'Poulsen, Stig', 'Hjorthoj, Carsten', 'Carlsson, Jessica']","['Mundy SS', 'Foss SLW', 'Poulsen S', 'Hjorthoj C', 'Carlsson J']","['Competence Centre for Transcultural Psychiatry (CTP), Mental Health Centre Ballerup, Mental Health Services of the Capital Region of Denmark, Ballerup, Denmark; Department of Psychology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Methods: This review adopted a rapid review methodology. Available literature was searched in three online databases January 1, 2005, to February 28, 2019. Studies were included if they (1) applied digital health technologies, (2) focused on immigrants, refugees, or asylum seekers without age and country limitation, (3) reported nonclinical and/or clinical outcomes, and (4) were published in English or Indonesian. Narrative synthesis was developed based on the data extraction and quality assessment. Results: A total of 16 studies were reviewed that applied software, website, and videoconferencing technologies. These applications were applied in various stages of MHC (screening, assessment, diagnosis, and intervention). Participants reported satisfaction and positive attitudes toward applications of digital health in MHC, and positive improvement on their anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. However, the ethical standards of these digital health applications were poorly implemented and reported. Stigma toward mental disorders and lack of technology literacy were the main challenges in scaling up digital health applications for immigrants and refugees. Conclusion: Digital health applications in MHC are promising innovations that can improve the wellbeing of immigrants and refugees. As these technologies expand, ethical standards of practice and reporting need to be improved in delivering scalable digital MHC for immigrants and refugees.","['Liem, Andrian', 'Natari, Rifani B', 'Jimmy', 'Hall, Brian J']","['Liem A', 'Natari RB', 'Jimmy', 'Hall BJ']","['Global and Community Mental Health Research Group, Department of Psychology, University of Macau, Macao (SAR), China.', 'School of Psychology and The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Jambi Regional Psychiatric Hospital, Jambi City, Indonesia.', 'School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Department of Computer Science, The University of Surabaya, Surabaya, Indonesia.', 'Global and Community Mental Health Research Group, Department of Psychology, University of Macau, Macao (SAR), China.', 'Department of Health, Behavior and Society, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200604,United States,Telemed J E Health,Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,100959949,IM,"['Anxiety', '*Emigrants and Immigrants', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Refugees', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/therapy']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['digital health', 'e-health', 'ethics', 'immigrant', 'mental health', 'refugee', 'telemedicine', 'telepsychiatry']",2020/06/06 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/06/06 06:00'],"['2020/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/tmj.2020.0012 [doi]'],ppublish,Telemed J E Health. 2021 Jan;27(1):3-16. doi: 10.1089/tmj.2020.0012.

Results showed overwhelming evidence of the paradox across lifetime and past-year disorders for women and men. In addition, blacks' mental health advantage over whites widened after adjusting for socioeconomic factors. There was one exception: Black women experienced higher risk of lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder compared with white women.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the time between an incident mood disorder diagnosis and the receipt of disability services during a follow-up period of as long as 20 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used health administrative and social service data from ICES for 1 902 792 adults aged 18 to 59 years living in Ontario, Canada. A narrow cohort of individuals who had a new diagnosis of a mood disorder between October 1, 1997, and March 31, 2007, matched by sex and age to individuals with no history of mood disorder, included 278 296 participants. A broader cohort of individuals who had a new diagnosis of other common mental disorders during the same period, matched by sex and age to individuals with no history of mental disorder diagnosis, included 1 624 496 individuals. All individuals were followed up to a maximum end date of March 31, 2017. Data analysis was conducted from November 2017 to June 2018. EXPOSURE: Incident diagnosis of mood or common mental disorder. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Disability outcomes were as follows: (1) entry into the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP), signifying long-term inability to work because of a disability, and (2) admission into a long-term care (LTC) residence, signifying the inability to live in independent housing. Cox proportional hazards models were used. RESULTS: In the full cohort of 1 902 792 individuals, 278 296 participants (14.6%) were included in the mood disorder cohort (mean [SD] age, 37.5 [11.9] years; 157 386 [56.6%] women), and 1 624 496 participants (85.4%) were included in the common mental disorder cohort (mean [SD], 36.5 [11.8] years; 932 545 [57.4%] women). The incidence of ODSP initiation was greater among individuals with mood disorders than those without (51.5 per 10 000 person-years vs 25.5 per 10 000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.03; 95% CI, 1.95-2.11) and for those with common mental disorders (45.0 per 10 000 person-years vs 27.6 per 10 000 person-years; aHR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.55-1.60). The aHR for admission to LTC was also higher among individuals with mood disorders compared with those without (aHR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.80-2.69) and those with common mental disorders compared with those without (aHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.29). Individuals with bipolar disorders had greater ODSP rates than individuals with major depressive disorders (crude rate ratio: 4.31 [95% CI, 3.56-5.17] vs 1.82 [95% CI, 1.36-2.43]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that mood disorders were associated with elevated and early rates of disability services. Effective early intervention strategies targeting functional impairment in this population are encouraged.","['Frey, Benicio N', 'Vigod, Simone', 'de Azevedo Cardoso, Taiane', 'Librenza-Garcia, Diego', 'Favotto, Lindsay', 'Perez, Richard', 'Kapczinski, Flavio']","['Frey BN', 'Vigod S', 'de Azevedo Cardoso T', 'Librenza-Garcia D', 'Favotto L', 'Perez R', 'Kapczinski F']","['Mood Disorders Program, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', ""Women's Health Concerns Clinic, St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", ""Women's College Hospital and Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Psychiatry and Institute for Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'ICES, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Mood Disorders Program, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Mood Disorders Program, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'ICES McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'ICES McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Mood Disorders Program, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201001,United States,JAMA Netw Open,JAMA network open,101729235,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Cohort Studies', 'Community Mental Health Services/*organization & administration', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Disabled Persons/*rehabilitation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Mental Health Services/*organization & administration', 'Middle Aged', 'Mood Disorders/*epidemiology/*rehabilitation', 'Ontario', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Young Adult']",PMC7588941,,,,2020/10/27 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2020/10/26 12:11'],"['2020/10/26 12:11 [entrez]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['2772159 [pii]', 'zoi200699 [pii]', '10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.20213 [doi]']",epublish,JAMA Netw Open. 2020 Oct 1;3(10):e2020213. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.20213.,10,,,"['Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Frey reported receiving a research grant', 'from Pfizer outside the submitted work.

Early detection of people at risk of developing any mental disorder is extremely important in the prevention of all mental disorders. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine depression predictors among adult residents in four Kosovo and Metohia municipalities predominantly inhabited by Serbian population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included the representative sample of adults in Leposavic, North Kosovska Mitrovica, Gnjilane and Pristina and was performed in October/November of 2009. The sample was selected from the list of citizens older than 18, received in the above mentioned municipalities. The Goldberg General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) was used as a research instrument. The methods of statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, simple and multiple logistic regression analysis, and analysis of variance, with a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: Problems with depression have been significantly associated with female sex (OR=2.24), older age (OR=1.01), lower levels of education (OR=0.50), unemployment (OR=1.09), poor financial situation (OR=0.45), abuse (OR=0.08) and assessment of the future political and security situation as a highly risky one (OR=3.01). CONCLUSION: To determine risk groups being in greater risk to suffer from depression is important for planning, enhancing, promoting and implementing the prevention strategies for this disease.","['Mirkovic, Momcilo', 'Djuric, Sladjana', 'Trajkovic, Goran', 'Milosevic, Jovana', 'Sojevic Timotijevic, Zorica']","['Mirkovic M', 'Djuric S', 'Trajkovic G', 'Milosevic J', 'Sojevic Timotijevic Z']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Armed Conflicts', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depression/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Serbia', 'Social Environment']",,,,,2016/01/06 06:00,2019/01/25 06:00,['2016/01/06 06:00'],"['2016/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/sarh1510584m [doi]'],ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2015 Sep-Oct;143(9-10):584-9. doi: 10.2298/sarh1510584m.,9-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Starting with the emergence of psychiatry with a humanizing stamp, in 1848, cover the six major periods of development of this speciality in Portugal, proposed by Barahona Fernandes, and add a seventh period that corresponds to the last quarter of the 20th century. They highlight the figures with greater emphasis during these periods, as well as their contributions to the speciality, not forgetting the essential role of Ordens Hospitaleiras (Hospitallers Orders). The transition period for mental health is examined in the light of the socio-political conditions of that time. The authors then describe both the teaching of psychiatry, and the actual training program of that medical speciality in Portugal. In this regard, the authors address the on-going mental health policies and their consequences on the current situation on the ground. Aspects such as the prevalence of mental disorders in Portugal, the current status of training in psychiatry, the sub-specialities of psychiatry and allied professions, the main areas of research, workforce issues and human rights issues are also analysed. Finally, the authors end with a few words about the future and the challenges of psychiatry in Portugal.","['Palha, Antonio', 'Marques-Teixeira, Joao']","['Palha A', 'Marques-Teixeira J']","['University of Porto, Portuguese Society of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Portugal. apalha@sapo.pt']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,England,Int Rev Psychiatry,"International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)",8918131,IM,"['History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', '*Mental Health/history', '*Mental Health Services/history', 'Portugal', '*Psychiatry/history']",,,,,2012/09/07 06:00,2013/02/15 06:00,['2012/09/07 06:00'],"['2012/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09540261.2012.695279 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Rev Psychiatry. 2012 Aug;24(4):334-40. doi: 10.3109/09540261.2012.695279.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It refers to what people know and believe about mental health disorders. People's knowledge and beliefs help them to recognize, manage and prevent mental disorders. Generally, older adults have lower health literacy compared to young and middle-aged adults. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This is the first study on the mental health literacy of Korean older adults. This study looks beyond peoples' ability to recognize mental health disorders and their opinions about them. It identifies factors that are associated with mental health literacy (level of education and social support, the number of people in one's social circles and how individuals rate their health). WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Older adults might get more out of mental health literacy programmes in group or social settings. Programmes that use older adult peer educators/supporters, such as the ""older people's champions"" of the Healthy Passport programme in England, might make the programmes more effective. Mental health campaigns, such as Australia's beyondblue, might increase mental health literacy of older adults. ABSTRACT: Introduction Korea is experiencing rapid population ageing, spurring an increased need for mental health services for the elderly. Approximately one-third of Korean older adults experience depressive symptoms, and Korea has the highest elder suicide rate among 34 developed nations. Mental health literacy is an important component of promoting mental health, yet studies on the concept have been conducted in few countries. Aim This study examines the level of mental health literacy among Korean older adults and identifies factors associated with their mental health literacy. Method A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 596 community-dwelling Korean adults aged 65 and older. Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use framed the study. Results Overall, participants displayed low levels of mental health literacy. They had difficulty recognizing their mental health issues and had limited knowledge about self-help strategies. Mental health literacy was positively associated with education, social support, social network and health status. Discussion and Implications This study highlights a need for efforts to increase mental health literacy among Korean older adults. Strategies that have the potential to empower this population to proactively attend to their mental health include community-based education and national mental health campaigns.","['Kim, Y S', 'Lee, H Y', 'Lee, M H', 'Simms, T', 'Park, B H']","['Kim YS', 'Lee HY', 'Lee MH', 'Simms T', 'Park BH']","['Graduate School of East-West Medicine Science, Kyunghee University, Yongin-Si, Gyeonggi-Do, South Korea.', 'The School of Social Work, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'The School of Social Work, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'The School of Social Work, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Social Welfare, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170803,England,J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs,Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing,9439514,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Literacy/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Republic of Korea']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Korea', 'Korean older adults', 'mental health', 'mental health literacy', 'social network', 'social support']",2017/05/06 06:00,2018/04/25 06:00,['2017/05/06 06:00'],"['2017/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jpm.12395 [doi]'],ppublish,J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs. 2017 Sep;24(7):523-533. doi: 10.1111/jpm.12395.

This systematic review synthesizes the empirical literature related to violence exposure for refugees resettled in high-income countries and the impact of that exposure on mental health symptoms. The authors reviewed quantitative studies published from 2000 to 2018 and found 12 studies met criteria for inclusion. Studies were excluded if the study did not include a measured mental health outcome, if violence exposure was not measured and reported on distinctly from nonviolent exposures, if the sample did not include a refugee population, or if the relationship between violence exposure and mental health of refugees was not empirically examined. Overall, studies found that resettled refugee populations were more likely to have higher rates of violence exposure than comparison groups. This violence exposure was significantly related to higher mental health symptoms, including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and, most commonly reported, posttraumatic stress disorder. However, there is substantial heterogeneity in measurement of violence exposure, particularly in the use of author-created scales. The vast majority of included studies examined only exposure to violence prior to resettlement. The review shows significant evidence for the effect of violence prior to resettlement on mental health after resettlement and reveals a need for improved measurement and definitions of violence exposure at different time points for resettled refugee populations. Assessing current exposure to violence is an important step for effective intervention related to mental health dilemmas for refugee populations.","['Scoglio, Arielle A J', 'Salhi, Carmel']","['Scoglio AAJ', 'Salhi C']","['Institute of Health Equity and Social Justice Research, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Bouve College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20200402,United States,Trauma Violence Abuse,"Trauma, violence & abuse",100890578,IM,"['Anxiety Disorders', '*Exposure to Violence', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Refugees', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['PTSD', 'mental health and violence', 'violence exposure', 'war']",2020/04/03 06:00,2022/01/28 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1524838020915584 [doi]'],ppublish,Trauma Violence Abuse. 2021 Dec;22(5):1192-1208. doi: 10.1177/1524838020915584.

However, the DSM-5 does not specify the number or type of symptoms needed to assign them. The purpose of the current study was to extend our understanding of subthreshold PTSD by comparing four commonly used definitions adapted to the DSM-5 PTSD criteria in an outpatient treatment-seeking sample. METHODS: Veterans (N = 193) presenting to PTSD clinics were assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). Participants reported a criterion A traumatic event, but did not meet criteria for threshold-PTSD. We hypothesized that the number of veterans captured would be highest when fewer specific criterion sets were required by the subthreshold definition. RESULTS: Our hypothesis was upheld in that the more criteria required by the subthreshold PTSD definition, the lower the number of veterans counted within the group. LIMITATIONS: The study consisted primarily of trauma treatment-seeking male veterans, with chronic PTSD symptoms. In addition, the sample size was small and was collected as part of routine clinical care. CONCLUSIONS: These results support previous contentions around careful decision making when defining what constitutes subthreshold PTSD in research and clinical work. It also points to the need for continued research to better understand the diagnostic and treatment implications of subthreshold PTSD.","['Franklin, C Laurel', 'Raines, Amanda M', 'Chambliss, Jessica L', 'Walton, Jessica L', 'Maieritsch, Kelly P']","['Franklin CL', 'Raines AM', 'Chambliss JL', 'Walton JL', 'Maieritsch KP']","['Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System, 2400 Canal Street, New Orleans, LA 70119, USA; South Central Mental Illness Research, Education & Clinical Center (MIRECC), New Orleans, LA 70119, USA; Tulane University School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.

It is estimated that one in 10 children in Japan experience difficulties in their school life. Using the QTA30 we evaluated mental health in children at an outpatient clinic in a local hospital. METHODS: All elementary and junior high school students (>/=9 years) who visited our institution between December 1 2019 and March 31 2020 were asked to complete the QTA30. RESULT: A total of 372 children responded. Half of the children with a psychosomatic disorder and 9% of children with other chronic disorders were suspected to have poor mental health. Suspected poor mental health was associated with higher odds of female gender (odds ratio [OR]: 1.89, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-3.39), junior high school students (OR: 3.73, 95% CI: 2.11-6.73), and not enjoying exercise (OR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.16-3.9). The mean +/- standard deviation total QTA30 score was significantly worse in children with psychosomatic disorders (38.0 +/- 19.1) among children with other chronic diseases; however, only the score in children with central precocious puberty (27.4 +/- 13.7) showed no difference. CONCLUSION: Based on our survey, the percentage of children suspected to have mental health problems manifesting as non-psychosomatic chronic disorders was similar to the proportion of children suspected to experience difficulties with their school life. Pediatricians should carefully consider the possibility of mental health problems when children are seen in regular visits to the outpatient clinic.","['Saito, Mari', 'Kikuchi, Yutaka', 'Lefor, Alan Kawarai', 'Hoshina, Masaru']","['Saito M', 'Kikuchi Y', 'Lefor AK', 'Hoshina M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Haga Red Cross Hospital, Mouka, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Haga Red Cross Hospital, Mouka, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Jichi Medical University, Simotsuke, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Haga Red Cross Hospital, Mouka, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210923,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Mental Health', 'Outpatient Clinics, Hospital', '*Schools', 'Students', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['child', 'mental health', 'psychosomatic disorder', 'questionnaires']",2021/04/09 06:00,2021/11/23 06:00,['2021/04/08 12:57'],"['2021/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/08 12:57 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.14723 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2021 Nov;63(11):1297-1302. doi: 10.1111/ped.14723.

Traditionally, the interrelationship between genome and environment has been a central theme in research on the etiopathogenesis of mental health problems and in the very conception of mental health. In its application to psychopathology and mental health, psychiatric enviromics was defined as <<the study of environmental conditions and processes that promote mental health or increase the risk of developing mental disorders>>. However, environmental health -at least in Spain and in connection with its powers within the Spanish General Health System- has paid attention to aspects pertaining to risks associated with the physical, chemical and biological pollution of the air, the water and the ground, as well as to its correlation with food pollution. Although environmental risks such as air quality, extreme temperatures, noise, climate change and various environmental toxicants can play a particularly important role, they can hardly be identified as single etiopathogenic elements. This work reviews the recent literature on environmental research and problems of psychiatric morbidity and mortality. Although the results are inconclusive, future lines of research should consider a more agile interdisciplinary collaboration, allowing, on the one hand, a better understanding of mental illness and, on the other hand, to be able to shift from ""traditional"" environmental health to an environmental health that takes social environmental factors into account and seriously addresses the still little studied concept of ""social pollution"".","['Ordonez-Iriarte, Jose Maria']",['Ordonez-Iriarte JM'],"['Direccion General de Salud Publica, Consejeria de Sanidad, Comunidad de Madrid; Departamento de Salud Publica, Universidad Francisco de Vitorid; Sociedad Espanola de Sanidad Ambiental (SESA), Madrid, Espana.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted via the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang and SinoMed. Studies on the prevalence of BD in the general population in China were identified. Statistical analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis program. RESULTS: Altogether 32 studies conducted between 1984 and 2013 with 470,411 participants met the inclusion criteria for the analysis; the median age was 44.6 years and 49.6% of participants were female. The estimated point, 12-month and lifetime prevalence of BD in China were 0.09% (95% Confidence interval [CI]: 0.06-0.12%), 0.17% (95% CI: 0.10-0.29%) and 0.11% (95% CI: 0.07-0.17%), respectively. For BD-I, the estimated point, 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates were 0.06% (95% CI: 0.04-0.10%), 0.08% (95% CI: 0.02-0.30%) and 0.09% (95% CI: 0.05-0.16%), respectively. For BD-II, the estimated point and lifetime prevalence rates were 0.04% (95% CI: 0.02-0.06%) and 0.04% (95% CI: 0.02-0.09%), respectively. The 12-month prevalence of BD before the year 2010 was significantly lower than that after 2010 (0.12% vs. 0.26%, P=0.04). Meta-regression analysis revealed that younger age was significantly associated with higher 12-month prevalence of BD (coefficient=0.096, 95% CI: 0.027, 0.164, P=0.006). CONCLUSION: This first meta-analysis of the pooled prevalence of BD in China found that rates are generally lower than those reported in Western countries. Future studies with more rigorous and refined methodology are needed.","['Zhang, Ling', 'Cao, Xiao-Lan', 'Wang, Shi-Bin', 'Zheng, Wei', 'Ungvari, Gabor S', 'Ng, Chee H', 'Zhong, Bao-Liang', 'Wang, Gang', 'Xiang, Yu-Tao']","['Zhang L', 'Cao XL', 'Wang SB', 'Zheng W', 'Ungvari GS', 'Ng CH', 'Zhong BL', 'Wang G', 'Xiang YT']","['The National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders, China & Center of Depression, Beijing Institute for Brain Disorders & Mood Disorders Center, Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Unit of Psychiatry, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macao SAR, China.', 'Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Psychological Healthcare & Shenzhen Institute of Mental Health, Shenzhen Kangning Hospital & Shenzhen Mental Health Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Unit of Psychiatry, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macao SAR, China.', 'The Affiliated Brain Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (Guangzhou Huiai Hospital), Guangzhou, China.', 'The University of Notre Dame Australia/Marian Centre, Perth, Australia; School of Psychiatry & Clinical Neurosciences, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Affiliated Mental Health Center, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'The National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders, China & Center of Depression, Beijing Institute for Brain Disorders & Mood Disorders Center, Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Unit of Psychiatry, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macao SAR, China.

Patients with anorexia nervosa of life threatening severity frequently refuse psychiatric hospitalization. Ambivalence toward treatment is characteristic of eating disorders and patients are often admitted to inpatient programs under pressure from family and doctors. In this article, we report research on the positive or negative impact of involuntary admission in the treatment of eating disorders, its application and effectiveness as well as the adverse consequences of coercive treatment in eating disorders. A literature review was done. From a total of 134 publications which were retrieved from the literature search, 50 studies were directly relevant to the scope of this review and fulfilled all inclusion criteria. There are trends and arguments for both sides; for and against involuntary treatment in anorexia nervosa. The scientific literature so far is inconclusive, although in the short term, involuntary hospitalization has benefits. This review has also shown that involuntary hospitalization can have adverse long-term consequences for the patient-therapist allegiance. We conclude that in some cases, involuntary treatment can save lives of young patients with anorexia nervosa; however, in other cases, it can break the psychotherapeutic relationship and make the patient abandon treatment. It is the clinician who has to decide for whom and when to approve involuntary treatment or not.","['Douzenis, Athanasios', 'Michopoulos, Ioannis']","['Douzenis A', 'Michopoulos I']","['Second Department of Psychiatry, Medical School, University of Athens, ""Attikon"" General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Second Department of Psychiatry, Medical School, University of Athens, ""Attikon"" General Hospital, Athens, Greece.

Currently, prevalence of mental health disorders (MHDs) at the primary care level in post-conflict areas within the Northern Province of Sri Lanka is unknown. We aimed to explore this prevalence in conflict-affected populations attending primary care, using a structured package of validated screening tools for MHDs. METHODS: This cross-sectional study aimed to determine factors related to mental health disorders at the primary care level in Northern Province, Sri Lanka. A structured interview was conducted with internally displaced adults attending 25 randomly selected primary care facilities across all districts of Northern Sri Lanka (Jaffna, Mannar, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya). Participants were screened for depression, anxiety, psychosis, PTSD, and somatoform symptoms. RESULTS: Among 533 female and 482 male participants (mean age 53.2 years), the prevalence rate for any MHD was 58.8% (95% CI, 53.8-61.4), with 42.4% screening positive for two or more disorders (95% CI, 38.6-46.1). Anxiety prevalence was reported at 46.7% (95% CI, 41.9-51.5), depression at 41.1% (95% CI, 38.7-44.5), PTSD at 13.7% (95% CI, 10.6-16.8), somatoform symptoms at 27.6% (95% CI, 23.6-31.5), and psychosis with hypomania at 17.6% (95% CI, 13.3-21.9). CONCLUSION: This is the first study at the primary care level to investigate prevalence of MHDs among conflict-affected populations in the Northern Province, Sri Lanka. Results highlight unmet mental health needs in the region. Training intervention to integrate mental health services into primary care is planned.","['Doherty, Shannon', 'Hulland, E', 'Lopes-Cardozo, B', 'Kirupakaran, S', 'Surenthirakumaran, R', 'Cookson, S', 'Siriwardhana, C']","['Doherty S', 'Hulland E', 'Lopes-Cardozo B', 'Kirupakaran S', 'Surenthirakumaran R', 'Cookson S', 'Siriwardhana C']","['Faculty of Health, Education, Medicine, and Social Care, Anglia Ruskin University, Bishop Hall Lane, Chelmsford, CM1 1SQ, UK. shannon.doherty@anglia.ac.uk.', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA, 30329, USA.', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA, 30329, USA.', 'THEME Institute, 81/7 Pagoda Rd, Nugegoda, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'University of Jaffna, Thirunelvely, Jaffna, 70140, Sri Lanka.', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA, 30329, USA.', 'London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel St, London, WC1E 7HT, UK.']",['eng'],"['U01 GH001654/GH/CGH CDC HHS/United States', 'U01GH001654/ACL HHS/United States', '5U01GH001654-03/CC/CDC HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20190304,England,BMC Psychiatry,BMC psychiatry,100968559,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anxiety/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depression/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care/*organization & administration', 'Psychotic Disorders/epidemiology', 'Sri Lanka/epidemiology', '*Warfare', 'Young Adult']",PMC6399832,,['NOTNLM'],"['Conflict-affected population', 'Mental disorder', 'Primary care', 'Sri Lanka']",2019/03/06 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/03/06 06:00'],"['2018/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12888-019-2064-0 [pii]', '2064 [pii]', '10.1186/s12888-019-2064-0 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Psychiatry. 2019 Mar 4;19(1):83. doi: 10.1186/s12888-019-2064-0.,1,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6123-1238'],,"['ETHICAL APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Ethical approvals were obtained from', 'the Faculty of Medical Science Research Ethics Panel, Anglia Ruskin University,', 'UK (ref NS/jc/FMSFREP/15/16035), and the Ethics Review Committee, University of', 'Jaffna, Sri Lanka (ref J/ERC/15/68/NDR/0137).

A systematic review.,1029-1039,10.1007/s00737-022-01251-7 [doi],"Mental disorders during pregnancy are common, with long-lasting negative effects on mother and child. Treatment of these women is challenging, because of the high incidence of additional psychosocial problems and barriers on population and healthcare level. Collaborative care, collaboration between mental health and obstetric care professionals, may help to overcome these problems. The aim of this review is to review antenatal mental health interventions and analyse the impact of collaborative care. Two independent reviewers searched for RCT's in PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO. Trials studying the effect of psychological or pharmacological interventions on the mental health of pregnant women with psychiatric symptoms (and psychosocial problems) were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed study quality and risk of bias. Each study was scored on collaborative care criteria: multi-professional approach to patient care, structured management plan, scheduled patient follow-ups and enhanced interprofessional communication. Thirty-five studies were included. Most trials studied the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy on antenatal depression. Almost all interventions met at least one collaborative care criteria. Interventions were mostly provided by multiple professionals, but interprofessional communication rarely took place. Interventions that met more criteria did not more often show a positive effect on maternal mental health. There is lack of research on antenatal psychiatric disorders other than depressive and on long-term treatment outcomes. Collaborative care is partly implemented in most current interventions, but more trials (including interprofessional communication) are needed to be conclusive whether collaborative care is a key component in antenatal mental healthcare.","['Klatter, Celine K', 'van Ravesteyn, Leontien M', 'Stekelenburg, Jelle']","['Klatter CK', 'van Ravesteyn LM', 'Stekelenburg J']","['Department of Global Health, Medical Sciences, University of Groningen/University Medical Centre Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ, Groningen, The Netherlands. celineklatter@gmail.com.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Medical Centre Leeuwarden, Henri Dunantweg 2, 8934 AD, Leeuwarden, The Netherlands. celineklatter@gmail.com.', 'Department of Global Health, Medical Sciences, University of Groningen/University Medical Centre Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Global Health, Medical Sciences, University of Groningen/University Medical Centre Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Medical Centre Leeuwarden, Henri Dunantweg 2, 8934 AD, Leeuwarden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20220926,Austria,Arch Womens Ment Health,Archives of women's mental health,9815663,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Pregnancy', '*Cognitive Behavioral Therapy', '*Depressive Disorder', '*Mental Disorders/therapy', 'Mental Health']",PMC9734206,,['NOTNLM'],"['Collaborative care', 'Mental disorders', 'Pregnancy', 'Psychosocial']",2022/09/28 06:00,2022/12/15 06:00,['2022/09/27 00:20'],"['2022/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2022/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2022/09/27 00:20 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00737-022-01251-7 [pii]', '1251 [pii]', '10.1007/s00737-022-01251-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Womens Ment Health. 2022 Dec;25(6):1029-1039. doi: 10.1007/s00737-022-01251-7.

To ensure practitioners in remote and rural areas have the necessary skills, the Remote and Rural Healthcare Educational Alliance (RRHEAL) were asked to develop a pre-hospital mental health care course. METHODS: Several mental health care experts were asked to express an opinion on the essential content of such a course. Stakeholder review informed the development of a survey to identify the priority areas for training. The first round of the survey process involved an expert group of 16; the second round used a survey of over 300 remote and rural practitioners involved with the British Association for Immediate Care, Scotland (BASICS). RESULTS: The stakeholder review identified key content, summarised under the following topics: risk assessment; patient assessment; crisis management; handling difficult situations; engagement skills; mental health law; management of retrieval; pharmacology; theory and classification of mental illness; and understanding your network. DISCUSSION: This article shares how the needs within a national pre-hospital mental health care programme were identified, and demonstrates how consensus over the content of a national course was achieved through the use of a modified Delphi approach. The Clinical Skills Managed Educational Network (CSMEN), Self-Harm Mitigation Training (STORM(R)) and BASICS, alongside RRHEAL, contributed to this development. Using blended learning techniques the resulting course encourages a contextual approach to user needs, specifically teaching generic mental health care skills to staff who are often working single-handed, and are required to respond appropriately, locally and safely as they work towards achieving National Mental Health crisis standards.","['de Mello, Greg', 'Fraser, Fiona', 'Nicoll, Pam', 'Ker, Jean', 'Green, Gill', 'Laird, Colville']","['de Mello G', 'Fraser F', 'Nicoll P', 'Ker J', 'Green G', 'Laird C']","['NHS Education for Scotland, Remote and Rural Healthcare Educational Alliance, Inverness, UKClinical Skills Centre, University of Dundee, UKSelf-Harm Mitigation Training (STORM(R)) Project, University of Manchester, UKBritish Association for Immediate Care, Scotland (BASICS), Aberuthven, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Clin Teach,The clinical teacher,101227511,IM,"['Curriculum', 'Delphi Technique', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/diagnosis/therapy', 'Mental Health/*education', 'Needs Assessment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rural Health/*education', 'Scotland']",,,,,2013/11/14 06:00,2014/07/26 06:00,['2013/11/14 06:00'],"['2013/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tct.12054 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Teach. 2013 Dec;10(6):384-8. doi: 10.1111/tct.12054.,6,,,,['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies from around the world have shown that the rates of burnout appear to be high. It is also well recognized that individuals with mental illnesses frequently avoid seeking help for fear of stigma, affecting their careers and being rejected or treated differently by their peers, or due to the perception that they will be deemed unfit for practice or rejected from their preferred specialty. Students who are open about their mental health conditions are often ostracized by their own peers and dismissed or even mistreated by teachers who consider mental 'toughness' to be a requirement for success in the medical arena. The impact of socioeconomic conditions cannot be under-estimated. We carried out a survey of mental health and wellbeing of medical students in the National University of Asuncion. A sample of 180 students across different years showed that 21% had sought help and 4% had been diagnosed with a mental condition before entering medical school; 3% had been previously diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or Autism Spectrum Disorders; 14% currently consult with a health professional specifically about their mental health; and 8% reported currently taking medication for their mental health. The most common medication was Escitalopram at 21%, followed by Sertraline with 11%. Various sources of stress were identified, all of which were noted to be concerning four specific domains: financial difficulties, familial issues, housing issues, and difficulties surrounding studies. Of these students, 20% were CAGE positive and 9.4% reported using substances to feel better. These findings indicate that medical students need better support to ensure that they function better. They require in-depth exploration of the potential causes of their illnesses.","['Torales, Julio', 'Kadhum, Murtaza', 'Zarate, Gabriel', 'Barrios, Ivan', 'Gonzalez, Israel', 'Farrell, Sarah Marie', 'Ventriglio, Antonio', 'Arce, Andres']","['Torales J', 'Kadhum M', 'Zarate G', 'Barrios I', 'Gonzalez I', 'Farrell SM', 'Ventriglio A', 'Arce A']","['Department of Psychiatry, School of Medical Sciences, National University of Asuncion, San Lorenzo, Paraguay.', 'Oxford University Clinical Academic, Graduate School, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Psychiatry, School of Medical Sciences, National University of Asuncion, San Lorenzo, Paraguay.', 'Department of Psychiatry, School of Medical Sciences, National University of Asuncion, San Lorenzo, Paraguay.', 'Department of Psychiatry, School of Medical Sciences, National University of Asuncion, San Lorenzo, Paraguay.', 'Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy.', 'Department of Psychiatry, School of Medical Sciences, National University of Asuncion, San Lorenzo, Paraguay.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191008,England,Int Rev Psychiatry,"International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)",8918131,IM,"['Burnout, Professional/psychology', 'Education, Medical', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Paraguay', '*Social Stigma', 'Stress, Psychological/psychology', 'Students, Medical/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mental health', 'Paraguay', 'alcohol', 'medical students', 'wellbeing']",2019/10/09 06:00,2020/04/23 06:00,['2019/10/09 06:00'],"['2019/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/10/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09540261.2019.1667172 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Rev Psychiatry. 2019 Nov-Dec;31(7-8):598-602. doi: 10.1080/09540261.2019.1667172.

METHODS: We interviewed 200 adults under treatment in a university mental health outpatient clinic. The PTSD diagnoses obtained using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV) were compared with the patients' medical records. RESULTS: Forty-one patients (20.5%) were diagnosed with current PTSD, but only one of them (2.4%) had previously received this diagnosis. This study confirms that although PTSD is highly prevalent among mental health outpatients, it is remarkably underdiagnosed in teaching hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that psychiatrists in training may be failing to investigate traumatic events and their consequences and strongly indicate that trauma-related issues should be given more prominence in psychiatry curricula and psychiatrist training.","['da Silva, Herika C', 'Furtado da Rosa, Maisa M', 'Berger, William', 'Luz, Mariana P', 'Mendlowicz, Mauro', 'Coutinho, Evandro S F', 'Portella, Carla M', 'Marques, Pamela I S', 'Mograbi, Daniel C', 'Figueira, Ivan', 'Ventura, Paula']","['da Silva HC', 'Furtado da Rosa MM', 'Berger W', 'Luz MP', 'Mendlowicz M', 'Coutinho ESF', 'Portella CM', 'Marques PIS', 'Mograbi DC', 'Figueira I', 'Ventura P']","['Instituto de Psiquiatria, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Psiquiatria, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Psiquiatria, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Psiquiatria, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Psiquiatria, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Psiquiatria e Saude Mental, Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Epidemiologia e Metodos Quantitativos em Saude (DEMQS), Escola Nacional de Saude Publica (ENSP), Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Psiquiatria, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Psicologia, Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Psicologia, Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Psiquiatria, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Psiquiatria, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Psicologia, UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181011,Brazil,Braz J Psychiatry,"Revista brasileira de psiquiatria (Sao Paulo, Brazil : 1999)",100895975,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/education', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry/*education', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",PMC6794137,,,,2018/10/18 06:00,2019/07/28 06:00,['2018/10/18 06:00'],"['2017/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['S1516-44462018005007105 [pii]', '10.1590/1516-4446-2017-0025 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Psychiatry. 2019 May-Jun;41(3):213-217. doi: 10.1590/1516-4446-2017-0025.

Socio-demographic characteristics were examined as well. The presenting problem was accurate regarding a physical basis in only two-thirds and the disorder could, in some way, be related to a psychiatric diagnosis in 75% of the patients.

Based on reviews of the literature, papers from international conferences, and communication between researchers in various countries, different perspectives have emerged on classifying distress and disorders and designing treatment programs. The origins of these differences lie in philosophical, historical, and political developments in the West and the CIS. These different approaches often have made it difficult for mental health professionals from the CIS and the West to work together. The goal of this paper is 2-fold: to identify and recognize the main differences in these approaches and to propose specific solutions for bridging the gap. The basic approach of mental health professionals in the CIS is a physiological, nosological one--it focuses on the etiology of the illness. Although their main diagnostic tool is the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, it has undergone adaptations that reflect the Soviet medical and physiological attitude toward psychiatry. These changes have resulted in the abrogation and addition of disorder categories. For example, in the CIS edition of the ICD-9, there is no mention of post traumatic stress disorder as a distinct disorder. In contrast, in the West, the dominant approach is a symptomatic, phenomenologic one. Emphasis is placed on a dynamic understanding of the disorder and treatment is conducted by mental health professional (psychologists, social workers, psychiatrists). This contrasts with the approach used in the CIS, where psychological distress often is somaticized and treatment undertaken by physicians rather than mental health professionals. The authors of this paper call on researchers to come together and work jointly on the recognition and resolution of these differences. Then both groups will be able to offer concrete solutions and build tools that can benefit both sides. It is hoped that these new approaches will receive worldwide recognition and prove useful for other mental health professionals working with persons affected by the accident at Chernobyl.","['Yevelson, I I', 'Abdelgani, A', 'Cwikel, J', 'Yevelson, I S']","['Yevelson II', 'Abdelgani A', 'Cwikel J', 'Yevelson IS']","['Spitzer Department of Social Work, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Commonwealth of Independent States', 'Humans', '*International Cooperation', '*Mental Health', 'Radioactive Hazard Release/*psychology', 'Research']",PMC1469916,,,,1998/02/19 00:00,1998/02/19 00:01,['1998/02/19 00:00'],"['1998/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.97105s61551 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1997 Dec;105 Suppl 6(Suppl 6):1551-6. doi: 10.1289/ehp.97105s61551.,Suppl 6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted in the nationwide group of occupationally active people aged 19-65 years. The interview questionnaire comprised an extensive socio-demographic part and a psychometric part, containing questionnaires measuring the status of mental health, work ability, work satisfaction and family functioning. RESULTS: Slightly more than half of the respondents (54%) worked in occupations related to their profession. The majority (88%) worked full-time, 8 h a day (65%) being employed by 1 employer (92%). Most respondents were satisfied with their job (apart from the financial aspect) and family life; 59% of employees were stressed by their job, including 15% of those who experienced strong stress. The family situation was emphasized by 31% of the respondents. At least one health disorder was diagnosed in 42% of the respondents. Musculoskeletal disorders (19%), cardiovascular diseases (13%) and respiratory disorders (11%) were most frequently reported. At the same time 76% of respondents assessed their health as rather good and good. The mental health index fell within the average values, but 12% of patients reached the score indicating the risk of serious mental health problems. Most of employees assessed their work ability as rather good and good. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented show the direction of the activities that need to be undertaken in the workplace, namely prevention of occupational stress, musculo-skeletal, cardiovascular and respiratory disorders, which significantly limit work ability. It is also necessary to implement educational programs in the workplace. Such activities, if organized on a regular basis, bring the best results.","['Merecz-Kot, Dorota', 'Andysz, Aleksandra']","['Merecz-Kot D', 'Andysz A']",,['pol'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Med Pr,Medycyna pracy,0376642,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Family Relations', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', '*Job Satisfaction', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Occupations/statistics & numerical data', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Urban Population/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2014/01/01 00:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2015/04/24 06:00'],"['2015/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Med Pr. 2014;65(6):785-97.,6,,,,,"Kondycja zawodowa, rodzinna i zdrowotna pracujacych polakow, mieszkancow miast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several Criterion A measures exist, but few studies have compared these measures with each other. Moreover, debates about whether the constructs of Criteria A and B are redundant (i.e., weak incremental validity) should be framed around how different Criterion A measures perform relative to others. This study of 204 undergraduate students evaluated multiple measures of Criterion A. These measures were strongly correlated with Criterion B, but evidenced incremental validity (39% of outcomes, 5% average additional variance explained) with outcomes of psychopathology and interpersonal impairments, and less consistent incremental validity with suicidality, aggression, and mental health utilization. We discuss how these results inform the construct of Criterion A relative to Criterion B and evaluate strengths/weaknesses of Criterion A measures.","['Roche, Michael J', 'Jaweed, Sarah']","['Roche MJ', 'Jaweed S']","['West Chester University of Pennsylvania, USA.', 'West Chester University of Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211217,United States,Assessment,Assessment,9431219,IM,"['Humans', '*Personality Disorders/diagnosis', '*Personality', 'Aggression', 'Individuality', 'Mental Health']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Criterion A', 'DSM-5 alternative personality disorder model', 'Level of Personality Functioning Scale', 'multi-method', 'personality disorders', 'personality inventory for DSM-5']",2021/12/18 06:00,2023/03/10 06:00,['2021/12/17 08:38'],"['2021/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/17 08:38 [entrez]']",['10.1177/10731911211059763 [doi]'],ppublish,Assessment. 2023 Apr;30(3):689-705. doi: 10.1177/10731911211059763.

Describing the postwar psychosocial burden on medical care can help direct public health interventions. We performed an emergency department (ED)-based assessment of the mental health status of ethnic Albanian patients 2 years after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization-led bombing of Serbia and Kosovo in 1999. METHODS: This study was conducted July 30, 2001, to August 30, 2001, in the ED of a hospital in Pristina, Kosovo. Investigators collected data through systematic sampling of every sixth nonacute ED patient presenting for care; 87.7% of patients agreed to participate. Respondents completed a structured questionnaire, including demographic characteristics, the Short Form-36, and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. RESULTS: All 306 respondents were ethnic Albanians; mean age was 39 years (SD 17.9 years). Of respondents, 58% had become refugees during the war. Two hundred ninety-six (97%) reported experiencing at least one traumatic event during the war; the average number of traumatic events encountered by participants was 6.6. Forty-three (14%) reported symptoms that met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder; mean Short Form-36 Mental Component Summary score was 42.1 (SD 12.5). Separate multivariable linear regression models confirmed our belief that older age, female sex, less than a high school education, and having experienced a greater number of traumatic events would be associated with more posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and lower Mental Component Summary scores. CONCLUSION: Mental health problems among ED patients in Kosovo, particularly among specific vulnerable populations, are a significant public health concern 2 years after the conflict.","['Fernandez, William G', 'Galea, Sandro', 'Ahern, Jennifer', 'Sisco, Sarah', 'Waldman, Ronald J', 'Koci, Bajram', 'Vlahov, David']","['Fernandez WG', 'Galea S', 'Ahern J', 'Sisco S', 'Waldman RJ', 'Koci B', 'Vlahov D']","['Division of Emergency Medicine, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ann Emerg Med,Annals of emergency medicine,8002646,IM,"['Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Refugees/psychology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*epidemiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Warfare', 'Yugoslavia/epidemiology']",,,,,2004/01/30 05:00,2004/09/04 05:00,['2004/01/30 05:00'],"['2004/01/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/01/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0196064403009880 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annemergmed.2003.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Emerg Med. 2004 Feb;43(2):E1-8. doi: 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2003.09.012.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data from the CZEch Mental health Study, a nationally representative study of community-dwelling adults in the Czech Republic were used. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview assessed the presence of mental disorders. 659 participants with current affective, anxiety, alcohol use and substance use disorders were studied. RESULTS: The treatment gap for mental disorders ranged from 61% for affective to 93% for alcohol use disorders. Mental health service use was associated with greater disability (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.02-1.05; p < 0.001), female gender (OR 3.31; 95% CI 1.97-5.57; p < 0.001), urban residence (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.12-3.04; p < 0.05) and a higher number of somatic diseases (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.03-1.67; p < 0.05). Self-identification as having a mental illness was associated with greater willingness to seek a psychiatrist and a psychologist.

Because persons with mental health disorders experience significant disease burden but often underutilize mental health treatment or experience poor treatment outcomes, they would likely benefit from increases in activation. No systematic reviews have been conducted to summarize and synthesize research on patient activation in persons with mental health disorders. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review to identify factors associated with activation and interventions that have shown to be effective in persons with mental health disorders. This integrative review indicates that better health status, less depression, positive health attitudes and behaviours, and higher quality therapeutic relationships may be associated with higher levels of activation in persons with mental health disorders. This review also indicates that a variety of interventions, most notably educational programs, are effective in increasing levels of patient activation in persons with mental health disorders. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Psychiatric mental health nurses and other clinicians should consider routine assessment of patient activation to inform individualized treatment plans for their clients. Clinicians should aim to form high-quality therapeutic relationships with clients as a way to promote higher levels of activation. Interventions that have been found to be effective in improving activation could be offered in a variety of mental health settings. ABSTRACT: Introduction Patient activation is understanding one's role in the healthcare process and having confidence, knowledge, and skills to self-manage one's health and health care. Researchers have begun to investigate patient activation in persons with mental health disorders, but no systematic reviews have been conducted to summarize and synthesize this research. For psychiatric mental health nurses and other clinicians to develop strategies to increase patient activation in this population, more information is needed about factors associated with activation and interventions that increase activation. Review Questions (1) What factors are associated with levels of activation in persons diagnosed with mental health disorders? (2) What interventions have shown to be effective at increasing levels of activation in persons diagnosed with mental health disorders? Method A 5-stage integrative review as described by Whittemore & Knafl. Results Twenty-nine articles were included in the review. Ten provided correlations between activation and other factors, and 20 examined the effects of interventions on activation. Some studies revealed significant correlations between a variety of health and treatment-related factors, and others revealed that some interventions, most notably educational programs, were shown to increase activation. Discussion The findings of this comprehensive review can inform psychiatric mental health nurses and other clinicians in developing strategies to increase activation in the patients with whom they work. More research is needed to provide a deeper understanding of the role of activation in the recovery and treatment of persons with mental health disorders. Implications for Practice Psychiatric nurses and other clinicians should assess for patient activation and incorporate strategies to increase levels of activation in patients in their practice. Positive therapeutic relationships likely enhance activation in persons with mental health disorders.","['Keen, Alyson', 'Lu, Yvonne', 'Oruche, Ukamaka M', 'Mazurenko, Olena', 'Draucker, Claire Burke']","['Keen A', 'Lu Y', 'Oruche UM', 'Mazurenko O', 'Draucker CB']","['Indiana University School of Nursing, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Indiana University School of Nursing, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Indiana University School of Nursing, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Department of Health Policy and Management, Indiana University Richard M.

In China, the current states of medical education and healthcare workplaces differ in certain areas from those in Western or other Asian countries. However, the mental health status of Chinese medical students has not been systematically analyzed. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to summarize the prevalence of mental health problems in Chinese medical students. METHODS: All cross-sectional studies that investigated the prevalence of any mental health problem among Chinese medical students were retrieved from the following databases: EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, OVID, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We accepted each individual trial's inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants. The National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies was adopted to appraise the methodological quality of each study. RevMan (version 5.3) was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Ten cross-sectional studies involving a total of 30,817 Chinese medical students were included. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and eating disorders were 29%, 21%, 11%, and 2%, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant differences in the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation between genders and no significant difference in the prevalence of depression between individuals of different ages (20 years and older or younger than 20 years). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Chinese medical students have relatively high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation but a low prevalence of eating disorders. Mental health problems in Chinese medical students should be taken seriously, and timely screening of and proper intervention in these mental health problems are highly recommended.","['Zeng, Wen', 'Chen, Ruiqi', 'Wang, Xingyue', 'Zhang, Qin', 'Deng, Wei']","['Zeng W', 'Chen R', 'Wang X', 'Zhang Q', 'Deng W']","['Department of Graduate Medical Education.', 'Department of Neurosurgery.', 'Department of Graduate Medical Education.', 'Department of Graduate Medical Education.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychiatric Laboratory, West China Brain Research Centre, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety/epidemiology', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depression/epidemiology', 'Education, Medical/standards', 'Feeding and Eating Disorders/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Mental Health/*ethnology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', 'Students, Medical/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Suicidal Ideation', 'Workplace/standards', 'Young Adult']",PMC6504335,,,,2019/05/03 06:00,2019/05/17 06:00,['2019/05/03 06:00'],"['2019/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['00005792-201905030-00019 [pii]', 'MD-D-18-07165 [pii]', '10.1097/MD.0000000000015337 [doi]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 May;98(18):e15337. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000015337.,18,,,['The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An investigation of this incident found that the pilot had a depressive disorder.METHODS: This systematic review investigated peer reviewed studies of pilot mental health published since 1980. A total of 58 papers were identified.RESULTS: Two main methodologies have been employed: questionnaires and database record searches. Anxiety, depression, and suicide were the most commonly investigated mental health conditions. There were almost an equal number of studies that found a higher prevalence of psychological symptoms in pilots as those that found a lower prevalence, relative to controls or the general population. Prevalence rates were higher in studies relying solely on questionnaires than in studies employing database record searches.DISCUSSION: Prevalence estimates are closely associated with methodology, so it is difficult to determine the true rate. Factors that might account for low prevalence estimates include under-reporting of symptoms by pilots and a reluctance to diagnose on the part of health professionals. Factors that might account for high prevalence estimates include anonymous assessment, the use of questionnaires that do not align with clinical disorders, and inconsistent cut-off scores. It is recommended that future studies on prevalence use well-validated clinical measures, and that more research be conducted on the effects of particular disorders on job performance.Ackland CA, Molesworth BRC, Grisham JR, Lovibond PF.

Although psychiatric advance directives are legally binding in Germany and their benefits are widely acknowledged, they are still infrequently used in German psychiatric practice. AIMS: The aim of this study is to assess psychiatrists' attitudes toward the use of advance statements in mental health care. METHODS: A postal survey of psychiatrists in Germany was carried out to examine their views on advance statements in psychiatry. The survey addressed psychiatrists' experiences of and attitudes toward different types of advance statements, including psychiatric advance statements written by patients without any specific assistance, and joint crisis plans ( 'Behandlungsvereinbarungen'), where involvement of the clinical team is required. A total of 396 responded. RESULTS: Results suggest that generally speaking, respondents held favorable views on joint crisis plans for mental health care. In all, 80.7% of participants agreed that more frequent use of joint crisis plans in clinical practice would be desirable. However, clinicians' attitudes differ largely depending on the type of advance statement. Implications for the use of advance statements in psychiatry are discussed. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that increasing the support structures available to train physicians and inform patients could lead to increased adoption of advance statements.","['Gieselmann, Astrid', 'Simon, Alfred', 'Vollmann, Jochen', 'Schone-Seifert, Bettina']","['Gieselmann A', 'Simon A', 'Vollmann J', 'Schone-Seifert B']","['Ruhr University Bochum, Institute for Medical Ethics and History of Medicine, Germany.', 'Academy for Ethics in Medicine, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Ruhr University Bochum, Institute for Medical Ethics and History of Medicine, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Ethics, History and Philosophy of Medicine, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181029,England,Int J Soc Psychiatry,The International journal of social psychiatry,0374726,IM,"['Advance Directives/*psychology', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Decision Making', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Living Wills/*psychology', 'Male', '*Mental Competency', 'Mental Disorders/*psychology', '*Mental Health/ethics/standards', '*Mental Health Services/ethics/organization & administration', 'Middle Aged', 'Needs Assessment', 'Psychiatry/statistics & numerical data', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Advance directives', 'Germany', 'implementation', 'joint crisis plans', 'psychiatry']",2018/10/30 06:00,2020/06/13 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0020764018808328 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Soc Psychiatry. 2018 Dec;64(8):737-744. doi: 10.1177/0020764018808328.

This naturalistic study aimed to investigate well-being in the context of care-as-usual treatment for PTSD. Patients with PTSD attending a community mental health center (N = 318) completed measures of well-being and PTSD symptoms before and after symptom-focused treatment. Following treatment, well-being increased among patients with PTSD, with emotional, d = -0.25, and psychological well-being, d = -0.24, showing the largest improvements relative to social well-being, d = -0.15. Although levels of well-being improved overall within the sample, participant scores on measures of well-being remained low compared with the general population. Well-being predicted treatment efficiency such that participants with more severe PTSD symptoms benefitted more from care-as-usual treatment when they reported relatively high levels of well-being at the start of treatment. The findings suggest a benefit to including well-being as a pretreatment and outcome variable when evaluating PTSD treatments.","['Radstaak, Mirjam', 'Huning, Laura', 'Lamers, Sanne', 'Bohlmeijer, Ernst T']","['Radstaak M', 'Huning L', 'Lamers S', 'Bohlmeijer ET']","['Department of Psychology, Health and Technology, University of Twente, Enschede, the Netherlands.', 'Mediant, Community Mental Health Center, Enschede, the Netherlands.', 'GGNet, Apeldoorn, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Psychology, Health and Technology, University of Twente, Enschede, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20220219,United States,J Trauma Stress,Journal of traumatic stress,8809259,IM,"['Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC9306808,,,,2022/02/20 06:00,2022/06/18 06:00,['2022/02/19 17:03'],"['2021/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2022/02/19 17:03 [entrez]']","['JTS22798 [pii]', '10.1002/jts.22798 [doi]']",ppublish,J Trauma Stress. 2022 Jun;35(3):914-925. doi: 10.1002/jts.22798.

A similarly high prevalence of mental health problems in patients hospitalized with acute illness would have significant public health implications because acute illness and injury are both common, and mental health problems of depression, anxiety, and PTSD are highly debilitating. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In patients admitted after emergency care for Acute Illness (N = 656) or Injury (N = 661) to three hospitals across the United States, symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress were compared acutely (Acute Stress Disorder) and two months post-admission (PTSD). Patients were ethnically/racially diverse and 54% female. No differences were found between the Acute Illness and Injury groups in levels of any symptoms acutely or two months post-admission. At two months post-admission, at least one symptom type was elevated for 37% of the Acute Illness group and 39% of the Injury group. Within racial/ethnic groups, PTSD symptoms were higher in Black patients with injuries than for Black patients with acute illness. A disproportionate number of Black patients had been assaulted. CONCLUSIONS: This study found comparable levels of mental health sequelae in patients hospitalized after emergency care for acute illness as in patients hospitalized after emergency care for injury. Findings of significantly higher symptoms and interpersonal violence injuries in Black patients with injury suggest that there may be important and actionable differences in mental health sequelae across ethnic/racial identities and/or mechanisms of injury or illness. Routine screening for mental health risk for all patients admitted after emergency care could foster preventive care and reduce ethnic/racial disparities in mental health responses to acute illness or injury.","['Carlson, Eve B', 'Shieh, Lisa', 'Barlow, M Rose', 'Palmieri, Patrick A', 'Yen, Felicia', 'Mellman, Thomas A', 'Williams, Mallory', 'Williams, Michelle Y', 'Chandran, Mayuri', 'Spain, David A']","['Carlson EB', 'Shieh L', 'Barlow MR', 'Palmieri PA', 'Yen F', 'Mellman TA', 'Williams M', 'Williams MY', 'Chandran M', 'Spain DA']","['Dissemination and Training Division, National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Department of Veterans Affairs, Menlo Park, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hospital Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Dissemination and Training Division, National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Department of Veterans Affairs, Menlo Park, California, United States of America.', 'Traumatic Stress Center, Summa Health, Akron, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Department of Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Georgetown Howard Universities Center for Clinical Translational Research, Washington, DC, United States of America.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, DC, United States of America.', 'Department of Surgery, Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, DC, United States of America.', 'Center of Excellence in Trauma and Violence Prevention, Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, DC, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hospital Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hospital Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 MD012273/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001085/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20230920,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Humans', 'Female', 'Male', '*Mental Health', 'Acute Disease', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Anxiety/epidemiology', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology', 'Disease Progression']",PMC10511104,,,,2023/09/20 18:42,2023/09/22 06:43,['2023/09/20 13:35'],"['2023/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2023/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/09/22 06:43 [medline]', '2023/09/20 18:42 [pubmed]', '2023/09/20 13:35 [entrez]']","['PONE-D-23-00672 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pone.0286563 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2023 Sep 20;18(9):e0286563. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0286563. eCollection 2023.,9,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4431-2415', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6361-3176']",,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],"['Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be', 'freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise', 'used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Some groups of migrants are at higher risk of both mental disorder and sickness absence. Yet, research on sickness absence in relation to mental disorders among migrants is limited. This study investigates differences in sickness absence in the twelve-month period around contact with outpatient mental health services between non-migrants and various migrant groups with different length of stays. It also considers whether these differences are similar for men and women. METHODS: Using linked Norwegian register data, we followed 146,785 individuals, aged 18-66 years, who had attended outpatient mental health services and who had, or had recently had, a stable workforce attachment. The number of days of sickness absence was calculated for the 12-month period surrounding contact with outpatient mental health services. We applied logistic regression and zero-truncated negative binomial regression to assess differences in any sickness absence and number of days of absence between non-migrants and migrants, including refugees and non-refugees. We included interaction terms between migrant category and sex. RESULTS: Refugee men and other migrant men from countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) had a higher probability of any sickness absence in the period surrounding contact with outpatient mental health services than their non-migrant counterparts. Women from EEA countries with stays of less than 15 years had a lower probability than non-migrant women. Additionally, refugees, both men and women, with 6-14 years in Norway had more days of absence while EEA migrants had fewer days than their non-migrant counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Refugee men and other non-EEA migrant men appear to have higher sickness absence than non-migrant men around the time of contact with services. This finding does not apply to women. Several probable reasons for this are discussed, though further research is required to understand why. Targeted strategies to reduce sickness absence and support the return to work for refugees and other non-EEA migrant men are needed. Barriers to timely help-seeking should also be addressed.","['Straiton, Melanie', 'Liefbroer, Aart C', 'Hollander, Anna-Clara', 'Hauge, Lars Johan']","['Straiton M', 'Liefbroer AC', 'Hollander AC', 'Hauge LJ']","['Department of Mental Health and Suicide, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, PO Box 222, Skoyen, 0213, Oslo, Norway.

Nursing faculty members are required to develop and implement educational innovations that achieve effective learning outcomes, while using fewer resources. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the effectiveness of a constructivism-based learning project to achieve specific learning outcomes and to supplement approximately 30 clinical hours in a psychiatric-mental health nursing course. Students participated in a 10-week, multistage project that examined life histories, treatment resources, and evidence-based practice, as applied to a single individual with a mental illness. Students reported increased understanding of mental health and illness, developed personal relevance associated with the knowledge gained, and learned to problem solve with regard to nursing care of individuals diagnosed with mental illness. For many students, there also appeared to be a reduction in stigmatized attitudes towards mental illness. Constructivism-based learning is a promising alternative to supplement clinical hours, while effectively achieving learning outcomes. Future research is needed to further validate the use of this method for the learning of course content, as well as the reduction of stigma.","['DeCoux Hampton, Michelle']",['DeCoux Hampton M'],"['School of Nursing, Samuel Merritt University, Oakland, California 94609, USA. mhampton@samuelmerritt.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20110616,Australia,Int J Ment Health Nurs,International journal of mental health nursing,101140527,,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/nursing', 'Mental Health/education', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychiatric Nursing/*education', 'Teaching/methods']",,,,,2011/06/17 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/06/17 06:00'],"['2011/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1447-0349.2011.00755.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Ment Health Nurs. 2012 Feb;21(1):60-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1447-0349.2011.00755.x.

To gain a glimpse into this area of interest, we aimed to explore the characteristics of mental health research in North Korea and to identify the emphasis therein. In this context, four North Korean medical journals were selected from the Information Center on North Korea, with publication dates 2006-2017 (inclusive). For this bibliographic study's scope, we targeted studies on psychiatric problems in humans. We first selected articles based on their titles, and then finalized the study sample after reviewing the full text of primary sample articles. For main outcome measures, we used the absolute number and proportion of mental health research articles relative to total publications and the distribution of papers by research themes as defined by ICD-10 categories. Collectively, four journals published 162 mental health research articles from 2006 to 2017. The yearly volume and proportion varied between two and twenty-four and between 0.3 % and 2.7 %, respectively. The most frequently addressed ICD-10 category was F40-48, namely 'Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders,' and the most frequently investigated condition was somatoform disorders. In conclusion, there has been a slow but steady increase in the research volume of psychiatry and mental health problems since 2011. The finding that the highest amount of research was conducted on somatoform disorders may suggest that mental disorder symptoms may be represented differently under the influence of socialism in North Korea.","['Kim, Hae Won', 'Jeon, Woo Taek']","['Kim HW', 'Jeon WT']","['Department of Medical Education, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Institute of Behavioral Science in Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

However, less attention has been paid to examine possible mechanisms of transmission, which is critical to inform prevention and intervention efforts. The current study tested (1) whether the association between parental CM exposure and offspring CM exposure was mediated by (a) parental exposure to violence in adulthood or (b) other emotional stressors/adversities in adulthood and (2) the indirect effects from parental CM exposure to offspring mental health outcomes through parental adversity and offspring CM exposure. Data came from a longitudinal study of maltreatment on adolescent development, and analyses focused on adolescents living with a biological parent (N = 185, 51% female). Biological parents (95% mothers) reported on their history of CM and exposure to other adversities across their lifetime. Adolescents self-reported lifetime CM experiences and current depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and externalizing behaviors in late adolescence (M(age) = 18.49). Results showed a significant indirect effect of parent CM exposure on offspring's CM exposure and mental health through parental emotional stressors/adversities, but not physical violence. These findings highlight different types of stressors that may impact the risk for intergenerational transmission of CM and subsequent offspring mental health.","['Negriff, Sonya', 'Palmer Molina, Abigail', 'Hackman, Daniel A']","['Negriff S', 'Palmer Molina A', 'Hackman DA']","['166700Kaiser Permanente Southern California, USA.', 'USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, 5116University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, 5116University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 DA024569/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD039129/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200325,United States,Child Maltreat,Child maltreatment,9602869,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adult Survivors of Child Abuse/*psychology', 'Child Abuse/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', '*Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*psychology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['abusive parents', 'adverse childhood experiences', 'child maltreatment', 'psychopathology']",2020/03/27 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2020/03/27 06:00'],"['2020/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1077559520912342 [doi]'],ppublish,Child Maltreat. 2020 Nov;25(4):422-432. doi: 10.1177/1077559520912342.

Today, with ever-increasing access to the Internet and use of technology, the potential to provide all young people with access (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) to the support they require to improve their mental health and well-being is promising. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use participatory design (PD) as research methodologies with end users (young people aged between 16 and 25 years and youth health professionals) and our research team to develop the Mental Health eClinic (a Web-based mental health clinic) to improve timely access to, and better quality, mental health care for young people across Australia. METHODS: A research and development (R&D) cycle for the codesign and build of the Mental Health eClinic included several iterative PD phases: PD workshops; translation of knowledge and ideas generated during workshops to produce mockups of webpages either as hand-drawn sketches or as wireframes (simple layout of a webpage before visual design and content is added); rapid prototyping; and one-on-one consultations with end users to assess the usability of the alpha build of the Mental Health eClinic. RESULTS: Four PD workshops were held with 28 end users (young people n=18, youth health professionals n=10) and our research team (n=8). Each PD workshop was followed by a knowledge translation session. At the conclusion of this cycle, the alpha prototype was built, and one round of one-on-one end user consultation sessions was conducted (n=6; all new participants, young people n=4, youth health professionals n=2). The R&D cycle revealed the importance of five key components for the Mental Health eClinic: a home page with a visible triage system for those requiring urgent help; a comprehensive online physical and mental health assessment; a detailed dashboard of results; a booking and videoconferencing system to enable video visits; and the generation of a personalized well-being plan that includes links to evidence-based, and health professional-recommended, apps and etools. CONCLUSIONS: The Mental Health eClinic provides health promotion, triage protocols, screening, assessment, a video visit system, the development of personalized well-being plans, and self-directed mental health support for young people. It presents a technologically advanced and clinically efficient system that can be adapted to suit a variety of settings in which there is an opportunity to connect with young people. This will enable all young people, and especially those currently not able or willing to connect with face-to-face services, to receive best practice clinical services by breaking down traditional barriers to care and making health care more personalized, accessible, affordable, and available.","['Ospina-Pinillos, Laura', 'Davenport, Tracey A', 'Ricci, Cristina S', 'Milton, Alyssa C', 'Scott, Elizabeth M', 'Hickie, Ian B']","['Ospina-Pinillos L', 'Davenport TA', 'Ricci CS', 'Milton AC', 'Scott EM', 'Hickie IB']","['Brain and Mind Centre, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Brain and Mind Centre, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Brain and Mind Centre, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Brain and Mind Centre, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Notre Dame, Sydney, Australia.', 'Brain and Mind Centre, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180528,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Internet/*instrumentation', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', 'Research Design/*standards', 'Young Adult']",PMC5996175,,['NOTNLM'],"['community-based participatory research', 'eHealth', 'mental health']",2018/05/29 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/05/30 06:00'],"['2017/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['v20i5e188 [pii]', '10.2196/jmir.9716 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2018 May 28;20(5):e188. doi: 10.2196/jmir.9716.,5,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7929-1511', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4218-9238', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9555-5281', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4326-0123', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3907-0324', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8832-9895']",,"['Conflicts of Interest: LOP, TAD, CSR, and ACM have no conflicts of interest to', 'declare.

Sedentary behavior (SB) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Given the potential for physical activity (PA) to improve health and well-being in people with SMI, we developed a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate a group intervention aimed at reducing SB and increasing PA of inpatients with SMI. Our primary aim is to assess the acceptability and feasibility of Men.Phys protocol, a new integrated treatment protocol for psychiatric inpatients. Secondary aims are to verify if the Men.Phys protocol decreased sedentary behavior and increased well-being, in terms of quality sleep, quality of life, and psychopathological symptoms and other measures. METHODS: Will be enrolled people with SMI consecutively admitted to the emergency psychiatric ward in Colleferro, near Rome. Participant's physical activity, health, psychiatric and psychological status will be assessed at baseline. Randomised participants will receive treatment as usual (TAU) or the Men.Phys intervention. Men.Phys involves a group activity conducted by a mental health practitioner, during which patients repeat exercises that showed through a monitor. The protocol provides that, during hospitalization, the patient follow at least 3 sessions consecutively. Lazio 1 ethics Committee approved this research protocol. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, Men.Phys is the first RCT to investigate the impact of a group intervention targeting sedentary behavior in people with SMI during psychiatric hospitalization. If the intervention should be feasible and acceptable, further large-scale study can be developed and then implemented in routine care.","['Flocco, P', 'Pompili, E', 'Riggio, F', 'Nicolo, G', 'Bernabei, L']","['Flocco P', 'Pompili E', 'Riggio F', 'Nicolo G', 'Bernabei L']","['Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Mental Health Department, Asl Roma5, Rome, Italy.', 'Mental Health Department, Asl Roma5, Rome, Italy.', 'Mental Health Department, Asl Roma5, Rome, Italy.', 'Mental Health Department, Asl Roma5, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial Protocol', 'Observational Study']",,Italy,Clin Ter,La Clinica terapeutica,0372604,IM,"['Male', 'Humans', 'Sedentary Behavior', '*Cardiovascular Diseases', '*Mental Disorders/complications/therapy/diagnosis', 'Exercise', 'Mental Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bipolar Disorder', 'Physical activity', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severe mental illness', 'psychiatric ward']",2023/05/18 13:09,2023/05/19 06:42,['2023/05/18 07:23'],"['2023/05/19 06:42 [medline]', '2023/05/18 13:09 [pubmed]', '2023/05/18 07:23 [entrez]']",['10.7417/CT.2023.2536 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Ter. 2023 May-Jun;174(3):287-295. doi: 10.7417/CT.2023.2536.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: We outline the emerging research in the integration of digital tools in clinical care, known as blended care, and provide case examples of mental health technology platforms currently in use, summarise findings regarding novel technologies such as virtual reality, and outline real-world implementation challenges and potential solutions. RESULTS: Recent evidence shows that blended care approaches are clinically effective and improve service efficiency. Youth-specific technologies such as moderated online social therapy (MOST) are achieving a range of positive clinical and functional outcomes, while emerging technologies like virtual reality have strong evidence in anxiety disorder, and accumulating evidence in psychotic conditions. Implementation science frameworks show promise in helping overcome the common challenges faced in real-world adoption and ongoing use. CONCLUSION: The integrated, blended use of digital mental health technologies with face-to-face clinical care has the potential to improve care quality for young people while helping overcome the growing challenges faced by youth mental health service providers.","['Cross, Shane P', 'Nicholas, Jennifer', 'Bell, Imogen H', 'Mangelsdorf, Shaminka', 'Valentine, Lee', 'Thompson, Andrew', 'Gleeson, John F', 'Alvarez-Jimenez, Mario']","['Cross SP', 'Nicholas J', 'Bell IH', 'Mangelsdorf S', 'Valentine L', 'Thompson A', 'Gleeson JF', 'Alvarez-Jimenez M']","['Orygen, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and Centre for Youth Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Orygen, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and Centre for Youth Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Orygen, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and Centre for Youth Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Orygen, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and Centre for Youth Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Orygen, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and Centre for Youth Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Orygen, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; Centre for Youth Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and University of Warwick - Division of Mental Health and Wellbeing, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK.', 'Healthy Brain and Mind Research Centre and School of Behavioural and Health Sciences, Australian Catholic University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Orygen, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and Centre for Youth Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20230418,England,Australas Psychiatry,Australasian psychiatry : bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists,9613603,IM,"['Humans', 'Adolescent', '*Mental Health Services', 'Mental Health', '*Psychotic Disorders/therapy', 'Anxiety Disorders']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['blended care', 'digital mental health', 'youth mental health']",2023/04/19 00:41,2023/06/09 06:42,['2023/04/18 22:22'],"['2023/06/09 06:42 [medline]', '2023/04/19 00:41 [pubmed]', '2023/04/18 22:22 [entrez]']",['10.1177/10398562231169365 [doi]'],ppublish,Australas Psychiatry. 2023 Jun;31(3):302-305. doi: 10.1177/10398562231169365.

METHODS: Data were drawn from the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health for 2005 to 2014, which are annual cross-sectional surveys of the US general population. Participants included 172 495 adolescents aged 12 to 17 and 178 755 adults aged 18 to 25. Time trends in 12-month prevalence of MDEs were examined overall and in different subgroups, as were time trends in the use of treatment services. RESULTS: The 12-month prevalence of MDEs increased from 8.7% in 2005 to 11.3% in 2014 in adolescents and from 8.8% to 9.6% in young adults (both P < .001). The increase was larger and statistically significant only in the age range of 12 to 20 years. The trends remained significant after adjustment for substance use disorders and sociodemographic factors. Mental health care contacts overall did not change over time; however, the use of specialty mental health providers increased in adolescents and young adults, and the use of prescription medications and inpatient hospitalizations increased in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression in adolescents and young adults has increased in recent years. In the context of little change in mental health treatments, trends in prevalence translate into a growing number of young people with untreated depression. The findings call for renewed efforts to expand service capacity to best meet the mental health care needs of this age group.","['Mojtabai, Ramin', 'Olfson, Mark', 'Han, Beth']","['Mojtabai R', 'Olfson M', 'Han B']","['Departments of Mental Health, Bloomberg School of Public Health, and rmojtab1@jhu.edu.', 'Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University.', 'New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York; and.', 'Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Rockville, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['R01 DA019606/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 HS021112/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20161114,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depressive Disorder, Major/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*trends', 'Mental Health Services/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Prevalence', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",PMC5127071,,,,2016/12/13 06:00,2017/06/27 06:00,['2016/12/13 06:00'],"['2016/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2016-1878 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2016-1878 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2016 Dec;138(6):e20161878. doi: 10.1542/peds.2016-1878.

A multivariate logistic regression model identified current employment to increase the odds of HT (p < 0.001). A primary diagnosis of anxiety or stress-related disorder (p < 0.001), other rare primary diagnoses such as personality disorders (p < 0.001), and more pronounced clinician-rated social problems (p = 0.041) decreased the odds of HT. Overall, it remained difficult to clearly specify suitability for HT based on available sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.

Although located predominantly on mucosal surfaces, these microorganisms have profound effects on brain functioning through the gut-brain axis. METHOD: The content of the chapter is based on a study group session at the annual meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP). The objective was to discuss the emerging relationship between the human microbiome and mental health as relevant to ACNP's interests in developing and evaluating novel neuropsychiatric treatment strategies. The focus is on specific brain disorders, such as schizophrenia, substance use, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as on broader clinical issues such as suicidality, loneliness and wisdom in old age, and longevity. RESULTS: Studies of schizophrenia indicate that the microbiome of individuals with this disorder differs from that of non-psychiatric comparison groups in terms of diversity and composition. Differences are also found in microbial metabolic pathways. An early study in substance use disorders found that individuals with this disorder have lower levels of beta diversity in their oral microbiome than a comparison group. This measure, along with others, was used to distinguish individuals with substance use disorders from controls. In terms of suicidality, there is preliminary evidence that persons who have made a suicide attempt differ from psychiatric and non-psychiatric comparison groups in measures of beta diversity. Exploratory studies in Alzheimer's disease indicate that gut microbes may contribute to disease pathogenesis by regulating innate immunity and neuroinflammation and thus influencing brain function. In another study looking at the microbiome in older adults, positive associations were found between wisdom and alpha diversity and negative associations with subjective loneliness. In other studies of older adults, here with a focus on longevity, individuals with healthy aging and unusually long lives had an abundance of specific microorganisms which distinguished them from other individuals. DISCUSSION: Future studies would benefit from standardizing methods of sample collection, processing, and analysis. There is also a need for the standardized collection of relevant demographic and clinical data, including diet, medications, cigarette smoking, and other potentially confounding factors. While still in its infancy, research to date indicates a role for the microbiome in mental health disorders and conditions. Interventions are available which can modulate the microbiome and lead to clinical improvements. These include microbiome-altering medications as well as probiotic microorganisms capable of modulating the inflammation in the brain through the gut-brain axis. This research holds great promise in terms of developing new methods for the prevention and treatment of a range of human brain disorders.","['Dickerson, Faith', 'Dilmore, Amanda Hazel', 'Godoy-Vitorino, Filipa', 'Nguyen, Tanya T', 'Paulus, Martin', 'Pinto-Tomas, Adrian A', 'Moya-Roman, Cristofer', 'Zuniga-Chaves, Ibrahim', 'Severance, Emily G', 'Jeste, Dilip V']","['Dickerson F', 'Dilmore AH', 'Godoy-Vitorino F', 'Nguyen TT', 'Paulus M', 'Pinto-Tomas AA', 'Moya-Roman C', 'Zuniga-Chaves I', 'Severance EG', 'Jeste DV']","['Sheppard Pratt, Baltimore, MD, USA. fdickerson@sheppardpratt.org.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA. fdickerson@sheppardpratt.org.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Medical Zoology, University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine, San Juan, PR, USA.', 'Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, OK, USA.', 'University of Costa Rica, San Jose, CR, USA.', 'University of Costa Rica, San Jose, CR, USA.', 'Department of Bacteriology, Microbial Doctoral Training Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Stanley Neurovirology Laboratory, Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Curr Top Behav Neurosci,Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,101535383,IM,"['Humans', 'Aged', 'Longevity', 'Mental Health', '*Alzheimer Disease', '*Microbiota', '*Schizophrenia']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aging', 'Beta diversity', 'Mental health', 'Microbiome', 'Microorganisms', 'Probiotics']",2022/08/11 06:00,2023/02/25 06:00,['2022/08/10 11:33'],"['2022/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2022/08/10 11:33 [entrez]']",['10.1007/7854_2022_384 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Behav Neurosci. 2023;61:119-140. doi: 10.1007/7854_2022_384.,,,,,"['(c) 2022.

Past research in refugee mental health has reported wide variation in mental illness prevalence data, partially attributable to methodological limitations. This systematic review aims to summarise the current body of evidence for the prevalence of mental illness in global refugee populations and overcome methodological limitations of individual studies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A comprehensive search of electronic databases was undertaken from 1 January 2003 to 4 February 2020 (MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EBM Reviews, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, PILOTS, Web of Science). Quantitative studies were included if diagnosis of mental illness involved a clinical interview and use of a validated assessment measure and reported at least 50 participants. Study quality was assessed using a descriptive approach based on a template according to study design (modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale). Random-effects models, based on inverse variance weights, were conducted. Subgroup analyses were performed for sex, sample size, displacement duration, visa status, country of origin, current residence, type of interview (interpreter-assisted or native language), and diagnostic measure. The systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD) 42016046349. The search yielded a result of 21,842 records. Twenty-six studies, which included one randomised controlled trial and 25 observational studies, provided results for 5,143 adult refugees and asylum seekers. Studies were undertaken across 15 countries: Australia (652 refugees), Austria (150), China (65), Germany (1,104), Italy (297), Lebanon (646), Nepal (574), Norway (64), South Korea (200), Sweden (86), Switzerland (164), Turkey (238), Uganda (77), United Kingdom (420), and the United States of America (406). The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was 31.46% (95% CI 24.43-38.5), the prevalence of depression was 31.5% (95% CI 22.64-40.38), the prevalence of anxiety disorders was 11% (95% CI 6.75-15.43), and the prevalence of psychosis was 1.51% (95% CI 0.63-2.40). A limitation of the study is that substantial heterogeneity was present in the prevalence estimates of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and limited covariates were reported in the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive review generates current prevalence estimates for not only PTSD but also depression, anxiety, and psychosis. Refugees and asylum seekers have high and persistent rates of PTSD and depression, and the results of this review highlight the need for ongoing, long-term mental health care beyond the initial period of resettlement.","['Blackmore, Rebecca', 'Boyle, Jacqueline A', 'Fazel, Mina', 'Ranasinha, Sanjeeva', 'Gray, Kylie M', 'Fitzgerald, Grace', 'Misso, Marie', 'Gibson-Helm, Melanie']","['Blackmore R', 'Boyle JA', 'Fazel M', 'Ranasinha S', 'Gray KM', 'Fitzgerald G', 'Misso M', 'Gibson-Helm M']","['Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Centre for Developmental Psychiatry & Psychology, Department of Psychiatry, School of Clinical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Centre for Educational Development, Appraisal and Research (CEDAR), University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom.', 'Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20200921,United States,PLoS Med,PLoS medicine,101231360,IM,"['Anxiety/epidemiology', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Depression/epidemiology', 'Depressive Disorder', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Mental Health/trends', 'Prevalence', 'Refugees/*psychology', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology']",PMC7505461,,,,2020/09/22 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/09/21 17:14'],"['2019/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/21 17:14 [entrez]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['PMEDICINE-D-19-02869 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pmed.1003337 [doi]']",epublish,PLoS Med. 2020 Sep 21;17(9):e1003337. doi: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1003337. eCollection 2020 Sep.,9,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4617-0609', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3616-1637', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9342-2365', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6131-5741', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5043-8786']",,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to address this issue, a change in how health care professionals are trained may be essential. However, the majority of the few reports published on this field's training programs do not discuss the characteristics associated with the success or failure of these strategies. The purpose of this review was to systematically examine the literature about mental health training programs designed for health care professionals in order to identify the relevant factors associated with their effective implementation. METHODS: The MEDLINE/PubMed, SciELO, and Virtual Health Library databases were used to search for articles published before February 2017 and reviewed by two double-blind reviewers. RESULTS: We found 77 original papers about mental health educational programs. Many of these studies were conducted in the USA (39%), addressed depression as the main subject (34%), and applied a quasi-experimental design (52%). Effective interventions were associated with the following characteristics: the use of learner-centered and interactive methodological approaches; a curriculum based on challenges in the trainees' daily routines; the involvement of experts in the program's development; the enrollment of experienced participants; interdisciplinary group work; flexible timing; the use of e-learning resources; and optimizing the implementation of knowledge into the participants' routine work practices. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These results will be helpful for planning and improving the quality of future educational programs in mental health.","['Blanco-Vieira, Thiago', 'Ramos, Fernando Augusto da Cunha', 'Lauridsen-Ribeiro, Edith', 'Ribeiro, Marcos Vinicius Vieira', 'Meireles, Elisa Andrade', 'Nobrega, Brunno Araujo', 'Motta Palma, Sonia Maria', 'Ratto, Maria de Fatima', 'Caetano, Sheila Cavalcante', 'Ribeiro, Wagner Silva', 'Rosario, Maria Conceicao do']","['Blanco-Vieira T', 'Ramos FADC', 'Lauridsen-Ribeiro E', 'Ribeiro MVV', 'Meireles EA', 'Nobrega BA', 'Motta Palma SM', 'Ratto MF', 'Caetano SC', 'Ribeiro WS', 'Rosario MCD']","['Dr. Blanco-Vieira: Child Psychiatrist, Post Graduation Student, Department of Psychiatry, UNIFESP, and Collaborator Professor at the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Specialization Course (CESMIA), Federal University of Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Due to the myriad of underlying causes and subsequent effects of mental illness, these conditions often trigger fear and misunderstanding among the general population. Common mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety disorders often affect an individual's thoughts, feelings, abilities, and behaviours. Anxiety disorder is characterized by an irrational fear of certain things or events. It is often attributed as the feeling of worry about anticipated events and fear in response to current events. This work has identified several related research efforts on the general well-being and psychological distress using data mining. However, there is inadequate research done using a similar method on specific mental health issues, especially related to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). In view of this gap, this study focuses on implementing a novel feature selection and data mining classifier system. Under the proposed method, Shapley value will be implemented as the feature selection of the data mining classifier on the mental health data. The approach is used to predict GAD among women. The methodology for this research is adapted from the process of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). This methodology consists of 5 main phases; namely data acquisition, data pre-processing, feature selection, classification prediction, and evaluation. Using this enhanced prediction algorithm, any women can get help if they are perceived to be suffering from GAD. By designing an effective way of identifying individuals who may be suffering from mental illnesses, we hope that our work would improve the awareness surrounding mental health issues especially among women and enable them to undertake autonomous decision in seeking mental health services.","['Jothi, Neesha', 'Husain, Wahidah', ""Rashid, Nur'Aini Abdul""]","['Jothi N', 'Husain W', 'Rashid NA']","['School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800 Penang, Malaysia.', 'School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800 Penang, Malaysia.', 'School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800 Penang, Malaysia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200406,England,J Infect Public Health,Journal of infection and public health,101487384,IM,"['*Anxiety', '*Anxiety Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Fear', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Data mining', 'Data mining in healthcare', 'Feature selection', 'Generalized anxiety disorder', 'Shapley value']",2020/04/11 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/04/11 06:00'],"['2018/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['S1876-0341(20)30401-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jiph.2020.02.042 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect Public Health. 2021 Jan;14(1):103-108. doi: 10.1016/j.jiph.2020.02.042.

METHOD: The longitudinal Beyond Bushfires study included 1017 respondents (Wave 1; 3-4 years after the fires), 736 (76.1%) at Wave 2 (5 years after the fires) and 525 (51.6%) at Wave 3 (10 years after the fires). The survey indexed fire-related and subsequent stressful events, probable posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, alcohol use, severe distress and receipt of health services for mental health problems. RESULTS: Relative to their status 3-4 years after the fires, there were reduced rates of fire-related posttraumatic stress disorder (6.2% vs 12.2%), general posttraumatic stress disorder (14.9% vs 18.7%) and severe distress (4.4% vs 7.5%) at 10 years. There were comparable rates between Wave 1 and Wave 3 for depression (10.9% vs 8.3%) and alcohol abuse (21.8% vs 18.5%). Of people in high-affected regions, 22.1% had posttraumatic stress disorder, depression or severe distress at Wave 3. One-third to one-half of participants who reported probable posttraumatic stress disorder or depression at any assessment did not display the disorder at the next assessment. Worsening of mental health at Wave 3 was associated with the extent of property loss, exposure to recent traumatic events or recent stressful life events. Only 24.6% of those with a probable disorder had sought professional help for this in the previous 6 months. CONCLUSION: Approximately one-fifth of people from high-affected areas have a probable psychological disorder a decade after the fires. Mental health appears to fluctuate for those who are not consistently resilient, apparently as a result of ongoing stressors. The observation that most people with probable disorder are not receiving care highlights the need for further planning about managing long-term mental health needs of disaster-affected communities.","['Bryant, Richard A', 'Gibbs, Lisa', 'Colin Gallagher, H', 'Pattison, Phillipa', 'Lusher, Dean', 'MacDougall, Colin', 'Harms, Louise', 'Block, Karen', 'Ireton, Greg', 'Richardson, John', 'Forbes, David', 'Molyneaux, Robyn', ""O'Donnell, Meaghan""]","['Bryant RA', 'Gibbs L', 'Colin Gallagher H', 'Pattison P', 'Lusher D', 'MacDougall C', 'Harms L', 'Block K', 'Ireton G', 'Richardson J', 'Forbes D', 'Molyneaux R', ""O'Donnell M""]","['School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Child and Community Wellbeing Unit, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Centre for Transformative Innovation, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Chancellory, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Centre for Transformative Innovation, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Child and Community Wellbeing Unit, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Social Work, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Child and Community Wellbeing Unit, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Child and Community Wellbeing Unit, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Child and Community Wellbeing Unit, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Emergency Services, Australian Red Cross, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Phoenix Australia, Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Child and Community Wellbeing Unit, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Phoenix Australia, Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20201111,England,Aust N Z J Psychiatry,The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,0111052,IM,"['*Depressive Disorder, Major/epidemiology', '*Disasters', '*Fires', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Black Saturday', 'Posttraumatic stress disorder', 'bushfires', 'disaster', 'resilience']",2020/11/13 06:00,2021/09/07 06:00,['2020/11/12 05:28'],"['2020/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/12 05:28 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0004867420969815 [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Psychiatry. 2021 Jul;55(7):666-677. doi: 10.1177/0004867420969815.

The model of CD found in current diagnostic systems is not without its flaws. The criteria for CD have often been criticised for lacking developmental sensitivity with regard to young children, and questions concerning the subtyping of the disorder and its overlap with comorbid conditions remain contentious. Compelling evidence nonetheless supports the view that this 'behaviour disorder' represents a complex mental health issue that belongs in these diagnostic systems. Most importantly, it identifies a group of children and adolescents for whom early intervention appears to be particularly critical and may serve to divert chronic trajectories of poor mental health.

OBJECTIVES: The article investigated the relationship between mental health and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms after orthopaedic trauma, and attempted to understand whether social support moderates the relationship between mental health and PTSD. METHOD: A cross-sectional research model was used. Two hundred participants were selected using simple randomisation within a hospital complex in Gauteng, South Africa. The sample consisted of 110 men and 90 women (x̄=37.8 years, s.d.=12.9 years). Data were collected using the Revised Civilian Mississippi Scale for PTSD, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and the General Health Questionnaire version 28. RESULTS: The findings of the study indicated that there is a statistically significant relationship between mental health and PTSD after orthopaedic trauma, and a positive correlation between poor mental health and PTSD (r=0.52, n=200, p<0.05). However, perceived social support did not moderate mental health or PTSD, indicating that perceived social support did not significantly influence mental health or PTSD, (MSPSS B=0.07, p=0.66). Those with high scores on social support had a lower regression coefficient (B=0.19) for mental health and PTSD than those who reported low social support (B=0.26). CONCLUSION: There is a significant relationship between mental health and PTSD of orthopaedic patients, and social support did not moderate the relationship between mental health and PTSD.","['Maselesele, Vhuhwavho M', 'Idemudia, Erhabor S']","['Maselesele VM', 'Idemudia ES']","['Department of Psychology, North West University, Mafikeng. vmaselesele@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130524,South Africa,Curationis,Curationis,7901092,,"['Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', '*Mental Health', 'Orthopedics', 'Social Support', 'South Africa', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic']",,,,,2013/05/31 06:00,2016/04/23 06:00,['2013/05/31 06:00'],"['2012/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4102/curationis.v36i1.122 [doi]'],epublish,Curationis. 2013 May 24;36(1):E1-7. doi: 10.4102/curationis.v36i1.122.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Data from 12,330 participants of the International SCI community survey (InSCI) from 22 countries were analyzed. Structural (partnership status, living situation) and functional aspects of social relationships (belongingness, relationship satisfaction, problems with social interactions) were regressed on the SF-36 mental health index (MHI-5), stratified by countries and for the total sample using multilevel models. Results: Functional aspects of social relationships were consistently related to clinically relevant higher MHI-5 scores and lower risk of mental health disorders (MHI-5 >56). Structural social relationships were inconsistently associated with mental health in our sample. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that functional aspects of social relationships are important resources for mental health. Interventions to establish and maintain high quality relationships should be considered in public health interventions and rehabilitation programs to reduce long-term mental health problems in persons experiencing physical disabilities.","['Fekete, Christine', 'Tough, Hannah', 'Arora, Mohit', 'Hasnan, Nazirah', 'Joseph, Conran', 'Popa, Daiana', 'Strom, Vegard', 'Middleton, James']","['Fekete C', 'Tough H', 'Arora M', 'Hasnan N', 'Joseph C', 'Popa D', 'Strom V', 'Middleton J']","['Swiss Paraplegic Research, Nottwil, Switzerland.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Medicine, University of Lucerne, Lucerne, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Paraplegic Research, Nottwil, Switzerland.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Medicine, University of Lucerne, Lucerne, Switzerland.', 'John Walsh Centre for Rehabilitation Research, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, St. Leonards, NSW, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School - Northern, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya and UM Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Department of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Physiotherapy Division, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa.', 'Clinical Rehabilitation Hospital Felix-Spa Bihor County, Oradea, Romania.', 'Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital, Nesoddtangen, Norway.', 'John Walsh Centre for Rehabilitation Research, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, St. Leonards, NSW, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School - Northern, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210416,Switzerland,Int J Public Health,International journal of public health,101304551,IM,"['*Disabled Persons/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Global Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', '*Interpersonal Relations', '*Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Observation', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC8565297,,['NOTNLM'],"['MHI-5', 'insci community survey', 'mental health', 'physical disabilities', 'social relationships', 'spinal cord injury']",2021/11/09 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/11/08 06:33'],"['2020/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/08 06:33 [entrez]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['619823 [pii]', '10.3389/ijph.2021.619823 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Public Health. 2021 Apr 16;66:619823. doi: 10.3389/ijph.2021.619823. eCollection 2021.,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Fekete, Tough, Arora, Hasnan, Joseph, Popa, Strom and Middleton.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concurrently there has been a policy focus on prevention and early intervention, suicide reduction and 'hard-to-target' groups such as Indigenous groups. It is not clear, however, whether research funding targeting health services or prevention or promotion has been prioritized, or whether funding priorities in general have shifted over the last decade. METHODS: A total of 1008 Australian-authored research publications and 126 competitive research grants in 2008 were coded in terms of their target of research, research goal setting and target group. These characteristics were compared with the research priorities of 570 stakeholders, burden of disease estimates and similar data collected 10 years earlier. RESULTS: The proportion of research funding for affective disorders, dementia and psychosis has increased, but not for anxiety disorders or suicide. Funding for childhood disorders has decreased. Funding for prevention and promotion is low and decreasing. With respect to research publications, substance abuse was associated with the most publications, followed by affective disorders, anxiety disorders and psychosis. When publications and funding are compared to stakeholder priorities and the burden of disease, the areas of suicide and self-harm, personality disorders, anxiety disorders, childhood conditions and dementia are all insufficiently funded. CONCLUSION: Despite mental health policy reforms through the last decade, there has been little change in the focus of research funding or publication output. There is modest evidence for a shift in support towards affective disorders as a major focus for research. However, the remaining gaps were very similar to those identified 10 years earlier showing that suicide, personality disorders and anxiety disorders are under-researched.","['Christensen, Helen', 'Batterham, Philip J', 'Griffiths, Kathleen M', 'Gosling, John', 'Hehir, Kanupriya Kalia']","['Christensen H', 'Batterham PJ', 'Griffiths KM', 'Gosling J', 'Hehir KK']","['Black Dog Institute, The University of New South Wales, Australia. h.christensen@blackdog.org.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130201,England,Aust N Z J Psychiatry,The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,0111052,IM,"['Australia', 'Biomedical Research/*trends', 'Cost of Illness', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/economics', 'Mental Health/*trends', 'Periodicals as Topic/trends', 'Research/*trends', 'Research Support as Topic/trends']",,,,,2013/02/05 06:00,2014/01/17 06:00,['2013/02/05 06:00'],"['2013/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['0004867412474072 [pii]', '10.1177/0004867412474072 [doi]']",ppublish,Aust N Z J Psychiatry. 2013 Apr;47(4):355-62. doi: 10.1177/0004867412474072.

Treatment gaps have been described, but a worldwide evaluation is lacking. We estimated, among individuals with a 12-month DSM-IV (where DSM is Diagnostic Statistical Manual) anxiety disorder in 21 countries, the proportion who (i) perceived a need for treatment; (ii) received any treatment; and (iii) received possibly adequate treatment. METHODS: Data from 23 community surveys in 21 countries of the World Mental Health (WMH) surveys. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed (WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview, CIDI 3.0). DSM-IV included posttraumatic stress disorder among anxiety disorders, while it is not considered so in the DSM-5. We asked if, in the previous 12 months, respondents felt they needed professional treatment and if they obtained professional treatment (specialized/general medical, complementary alternative medical, or nonmedical professional) for ""problems with emotions, nerves, mental health, or use of alcohol or drugs."" Possibly adequate treatment was defined as receiving pharmacotherapy (1+ months of medication and 4+ visits to a medical doctor) or psychotherapy, complementary alternative medicine or nonmedical care (8+ visits). RESULTS: Of 51,547 respondents (response = 71.3%), 9.8% had a 12-month DSM-IV anxiety disorder, 27.6% of whom received any treatment, and only 9.8% received possibly adequate treatment. Of those with 12-month anxiety only 41.3% perceived a need for care. Lower treatment levels were found for lower income countries. CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of service use and a high proportion of those receiving services not meeting adequacy standards for anxiety disorders exist worldwide. Results suggest the need for improving recognition of anxiety disorders and the quality of treatment.","['Alonso, Jordi', 'Liu, Zhaorui', 'Evans-Lacko, Sara', 'Sadikova, Ekaterina', 'Sampson, Nancy', 'Chatterji, Somnath', 'Abdulmalik, Jibril', 'Aguilar-Gaxiola, Sergio', 'Al-Hamzawi, Ali', 'Andrade, Laura H', 'Bruffaerts, Ronny', 'Cardoso, Graca', 'Cia, Alfredo', 'Florescu, Silvia', 'de Girolamo, Giovanni', 'Gureje, Oye', 'Haro, Josep M', 'He, Yanling', 'de Jonge, Peter', 'Karam, Elie G', 'Kawakami, Norito', 'Kovess-Masfety, Viviane', 'Lee, Sing', 'Levinson, Daphna', 'Medina-Mora, Maria Elena', 'Navarro-Mateu, Fernando', 'Pennell, Beth-Ellen', 'Piazza, Marina', 'Posada-Villa, Jose', 'Ten Have, Margreet', 'Zarkov, Zahari', 'Kessler, Ronald C', 'Thornicroft, Graham']","['Alonso J', 'Liu Z', 'Evans-Lacko S', 'Sadikova E', 'Sampson N', 'Chatterji S', 'Abdulmalik J', 'Aguilar-Gaxiola S', 'Al-Hamzawi A', 'Andrade LH', 'Bruffaerts R', 'Cardoso G', 'Cia A', 'Florescu S', 'de Girolamo G', 'Gureje O', 'Haro JM', 'He Y', 'de Jonge P', 'Karam EG', 'Kawakami N', 'Kovess-Masfety V', 'Lee S', 'Levinson D', 'Medina-Mora ME', 'Navarro-Mateu F', 'Pennell BE', 'Piazza M', 'Posada-Villa J', 'Ten Have M', 'Zarkov Z', 'Kessler RC', 'Thornicroft G']","['Health Services Research Unit, IMIM-Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Pompeu Fabra University (UPF), Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER en Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Mental Health, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'PSSRU, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Information, Evidence and Research, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria.', 'Center for Reducing Health Disparities, UC Davis Health System, Sacramento, CA, USA.', 'College of Medicine, Al-Qadisiya University, Diwaniya governorate, Iraq.', 'Nucleo de Epidemiologia Psiquiatrica - LIM 23, Instituto de Psiquiatria Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Universitair Psychiatrisch Centrum-Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (UPC-KUL), Campus Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Mental Health, Faculdades de Ciencias Medicas, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Anxiety Disorders Center, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'National School of Public Health, Management and Development, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Unit of Epidemiological and Evaluation Psychiatry, IRCCS-St. John of God Clinical Research Centre, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria.', 'Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Deu, CIBERSAM, Universitat de Barcelona, Sant Boi de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Shanghai Mental Health Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Developmental Psychology, Department of Psychology, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Interdisciplinary Center Psychopathology and Emotion Regulation, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology, Faculty of Medicine, St George Hospital University Medical Center, Balamand University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Institute for Development, Research, Advocacy and Applied Care (IDRAAC), Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Mental Health, School of Public Health, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sante Publique (EHESP), EA 4057, Paris Descartes University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Tai Po, Hong Kong.', 'Mental Health Services, Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'UDIF-SM, Subdireccion General de Planificacion, Innovacion y Cronicidad, Servicio Murciano de Salud.

Primary care physicians play a key role in the pharmacological treatment of mental health disorders among adolescents, however, little is known about the impact of these treatments on SU outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review summarizes the evidence regarding commonly used pharmacotherapy interventions for mental health and their impact on adolescent SU. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted across five databases as part of a larger systematic review of adolescent SU interventions. Studies were screened for eligibility by two researchers, and study data were extracted regarding study design, patient and treatment characteristics and results. Risk of bias analyses and qualitative syntheses were completed to evaluate the strength of the evidence and the impact of pharmacotherapy on SU outcomes. RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials exploring seven pharmacotherapies met criteria for inclusion. All studies had low to moderate risk of bias. Four studies evaluated pharmacotherapy for co-occurring depression and SU, three evaluated attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and SU, and three evaluated bipolar disorder and SU. Five of the 10 studies also included a behavioural intervention. We found no evidence that pharmacotherapy for co-occurring mental health diagnoses impacted SU. CONCLUSION: Family medicine clinicians prescribing pharmacotherapy for mental health should be aware that additional interventions will likely be needed to address co-occurring SU.","['Scott, Kelli', 'Becker, Sara J', 'Helseth, Sarah A', 'Saldanha, Ian J', 'Balk, Ethan M', 'Adam, Gaelen P', 'Konnyu, Kristin J', 'Steele, Dale W']","['Scott K', 'Becker SJ', 'Helseth SA', 'Saldanha IJ', 'Balk EM', 'Adam GP', 'Konnyu KJ', 'Steele DW']","['Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Health Services, Policy, and Practice, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Health Services, Policy, and Practice, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Health Services, Policy, and Practice, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Health Services, Policy, and Practice, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Health Services, Policy, and Practice, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.']",['eng'],"['K23 DA048062/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 DA050729/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Systematic Review']",,England,Fam Pract,Family practice,8500875,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity', 'Behavior Therapy', '*Bipolar Disorder', 'Humans', '*Mental Disorders/complications/drug therapy', 'Mental Health', '*Substance-Related Disorders/drug therapy']",PMC9126201,,['NOTNLM'],"['adolescent medicine', 'co-occurring disorders', 'mental health', 'pharmacotherapy', 'substance use', 'systematic review']",2021/08/28 06:00,2022/05/06 06:00,['2021/08/27 12:23'],"['2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/27 12:23 [entrez]']","['6358606 [pii]', 'cmab096 [pii]', '10.1093/fampra/cmab096 [doi]']",ppublish,Fam Pract. 2022 Mar 24;39(2):301-310. doi: 10.1093/fampra/cmab096.,2,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4511-8825'],,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

In the field of psychiatry, health economic evaluation is a recent method that can assist in choosing interventions with different cost and/or effectiveness for specific populations or conditions. This article introduces clinicians to the fundamental concepts required for critical assessment of health economic evaluations. METHODS: The authors conducted a review with systematic methods to assess the essential theoretical framework of health economic evaluation and mental health in Brazil through textbooks and studies indexed in the PubMed, Cochrane Central, LILACS, NHS CRD, and REBRATS databases. A total of 334 studies were found using the specified terms (MeSH - Mental Health AND Economic, Medical) and filters (Brazil AND Humans); however, only five Brazilian economic evaluations were found. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Economic evaluation studies are growing exponentially in the medical literature. Publications focusing on health economics as applied to psychiatry are increasingly common, but Brazilian data are still very incipient. In a country where financial resources are so scarce, economic analyses are necessary to ensure better use of public resources and wider population access to effective health technologies.","['Lima, Ana Flavia Barros da Silva', 'Cruz, Luciane Nascimento', 'Polanczyk, Carisi Anne', 'Maia, Carlos Renato Moreira']","['Lima AF', 'Cruz LN', 'Polanczyk CA', 'Maia CR']","['Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. afbslima@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Brazil,Braz J Psychiatry,"Revista brasileira de psiquiatria (Sao Paulo, Brazil : 1999)",100895975,IM,"['Biomedical Technology/*economics', 'Brazil', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*economics/therapy', 'Mental Health/*economics', 'Quality of Life']",,,,,2013/08/02 06:00,2014/01/16 06:00,['2013/08/02 06:00'],"['2012/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1516-44462013000200186 [pii]', '10.1590/1516-4446-2012-0989 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Psychiatry. 2013 Apr-Jun;35(2):186-92. doi: 10.1590/1516-4446-2012-0989.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mental health nurses (MHNs) are professionally the appropriate target group to support maintaining and increasing oral health. We aimed to develop and validate personas that reflect the attitudes and needs of MHNs regarding oral health in patients with a psychotic disorder. We used a human-centered design with contextual interviews (n = 10) to address the key issues of the problems and needs of MHNs working with patients with a psychotic disorder. We analyzed the data thematically and reflected on insights into unique personas, which were then validated by conducting semi-structured interviews (n = 19) and member checking. Four personas were found based on attitudes and perspectives, barriers, needs, suggestions for interventions, and site conditions regarding practicing oral care in this patient group. Our findings were as follows: the attitudes and perspectives differed from not feeling any responsibility to a holistic obligation, including oral health; suggestions for interventions for MHNs ranged from interventions focusing on improving skills and knowledge to using practical tools; most MHNs recognized themselves within a persona that had a holistic obligation that included oral health; in addition, the MHNs indicated that they considered the issue of oral health in this patient group important, but, in practice, took little responsibility for that role. These findings suggest that a toolkit with interventions for MHNs that are tailored to the personas that emerged from our research should be developed by MHNs in co-creation with designers. The differences between the perceived role and MHNs' practice in oral health highlighted the need for role clarification and professional leadership of MHNs regarding oral health, which should be considered when developing interventions.","['Kuipers, Sonja', 'Castelein, Stynke', 'Kronenberg, Linda', ""Veer, Job van 't"", 'Boonstra, Nynke']","['Kuipers S', 'Castelein S', 'Kronenberg L', ""Veer JV'"", 'Boonstra N']","['Research Group Healthcare & Innovation in Psychiatry, Department of Healthcare, NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences, Rengerslaan 8-10, 8900 CG Leeuwarden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Psychopathology and Clinical Psychology, Faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences, University of Groningen, Grote Kruisstraat 2/1, 9712 TS Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Psychopathology and Clinical Psychology, Faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences, University of Groningen, Grote Kruisstraat 2/1, 9712 TS Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Lentis Research, Lentis Psychiatric Institute, Hereweg 80, 9725 AG Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Dimence Mental Health Care, Burgemeester Roelenweg 9, 8021 EV Zwolle, The Netherlands.', 'Research Group Digital Innovation in Care and Welfare, Department of Healthcare, NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences, Rengerslaan 8-10, 8900 CG Leeuwarden, The Netherlands.', 'Research Group Healthcare & Innovation in Psychiatry, Department of Healthcare, NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences, Rengerslaan 8-10, 8900 CG Leeuwarden, The Netherlands.', 'KieN Early Intervention Service, Oosterkade 72, 8911 KJ Leeuwarden, The Netherlands.', 'UMC Utrecht Brain Center, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20230216,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,IM,"['Humans', 'Oral Health', '*Psychotic Disorders', 'Mental Health', '*Psychiatric Nursing', 'Social Behavior']",PMC9960686,,['NOTNLM'],"['human-centered design', 'mental health', 'nursing', 'oral health', 'personas', 'psychotic disorder', 'schizophrenia']",2023/02/26 06:00,2023/03/03 06:00,['2023/02/25 02:30'],"['2023/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2023/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2023/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/02/25 02:30 [entrez]', '2023/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph20043475 [pii]', 'ijerph-20-03475 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph20043475 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2023 Feb 16;20(4):3475. doi: 10.3390/ijerph20043475.,4,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9014-3408', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3592-1953']",,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inadequacies in mental health care delivery result in prolonged illness, disease progression, poorer prognosis, and greater likelihood of relapse, highlighting the need for a new approach to detect mental health problems and engage college students in services. We have developed a transdiagnostic, low-cost mobile mental health targeted prevention and intervention platform that uses population-level screening to engage college students in tailored services that address common mental health problems. We will test the impact of this mobile mental health platform for service delivery in a large-scale trial across 20+ colleges. Students who screen positive or at high-risk for clinical anxiety, depression, or an eating disorder and who are not currently engaged in mental health services (N = 7884) will be randomly assigned to: 1) intervention via the mobile mental health platform; or 2) referral to usual care (i.e., campus health or counseling center). We will test whether the mobile mental health platform, compared to referral, is associated with improved uptake, reduced clinical cases, disorder-specific symptoms, and improved quality of life and functioning. We will also test mediators, predictors, and moderators of improved mental health outcomes, as well as stakeholder-relevant outcomes, including cost-effectiveness and academic performance. This population-level approach to service engagement has the potential to improve mental health outcomes for the millions of students enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities.","['Fitzsimmons-Craft, Ellen E', 'Taylor, C Barr', 'Newman, Michelle G', 'Zainal, Nur Hani', 'Rojas-Ashe, Elsa E', 'Lipson, Sarah Ketchen', 'Firebaugh, Marie-Laure', 'Ceglarek, Peter', 'Topooco, Naira', 'Jacobson, Nicholas C', 'Graham, Andrea K', 'Kim, Hyungjin Myra', 'Eisenberg, Daniel', 'Wilfley, Denise E']","['Fitzsimmons-Craft EE', 'Taylor CB', 'Newman MG', 'Zainal NH', 'Rojas-Ashe EE', 'Lipson SK', 'Firebaugh ML', 'Ceglarek P', 'Topooco N', 'Jacobson NC', 'Graham AK', 'Kim HM', 'Eisenberg D', 'Wilfley DE']","['Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, Mailstop 8134-29-2100, 660 S.

We studied the relationships between anxiety, depression and emotional difficulties, and school absence (total, authorised and unauthorised) using data from the 2004 British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Survey (BCAMHS). The BCAMHS was a cross-sectional, community survey of 7977 5- to 16-year-olds. Emotional disorder was assessed using the Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA), and emotional difficulties using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) completed by teachers and parents. Teachers reported days absent in the previous school term. Multivariable negative binomial regression was used to examine the impact of emotional disorder and difficulties on absence. Age, gender and general health were explored as moderators. Anxiety, depression and emotional difficulties were associated with higher rates of all types of absence [rate ratios for total absence: anxiety 1.69 (1.39-2.06) p < 0.001; depression 3.40 (2.46-4.69) p < 0.001; parent-reported emotional difficulties 1.07 (1.05-1.10) p < 0.001; teacher-reported emotional difficulties 1.10 (1.08-1.13) p < 0.001]. The strongest association was observed for depression and unauthorised absence. Relationships were stronger for secondary compared to primary school children. Health and educational professionals should be aware that children with poor attendance may be experiencing emotional ill health, regardless of absence type. The absence may provide a useful tool to identify those who require additional mental health support. Findings highlight the widespread burden of emotional disorder and the need to support those with emotional ill health in continuing to access education.","['Finning, Katie', 'Ford, Tamsin', 'Moore, Darren A', 'Ukoumunne, Obioha C']","['Finning K', 'Ford T', 'Moore DA', 'Ukoumunne OC']","[""University of Exeter School of Medicine and Health, College House, St Luke's Campus, Exeter, EX1 2LU, UK. k.finning@exeter.ac.uk."", ""University of Exeter School of Medicine and Health, College House, St Luke's Campus, Exeter, EX1 2LU, UK."", ""Graduate School of Education, University of Exeter, St Luke's Campus, Heavitree Road, Exeter, EX1 2LU, UK."", ""School of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus, Exeter, EX1 2LU, UK.""]",['eng'],"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '104908/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '104908/Z/14/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",20190503,Germany,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,European child & adolescent psychiatry,9212296,IM,"['Absenteeism', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*standards', '*Psychological Distress', 'Schools', 'United Kingdom']",PMC7024694,['EMS83364'],['NOTNLM'],"['Absenteeism', 'Anxiety', 'Depression', 'Emotional disorder', 'School attendance', 'Truancy']",2019/05/06 06:00,2020/06/04 06:00,['2019/05/05 06:00'],"['2019/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/05/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00787-019-01342-4 [pii]', '1342 [pii]', '10.1007/s00787-019-01342-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2020 Feb;29(2):187-198. doi: 10.1007/s00787-019-01342-4.

Trauma has immediate and long-term effects on emotional wellbeing. Moreover, the experiences of one generation may influence subsequent generations via social and biological pathways. Poor mental health and emotion dysregulation associated with trauma may affect parenting behaviours, which may have long-lasting effects on children's development. METHODS: We use longitudinal data from a unique sample of 732 caregivers of children aged 6-36 months living in extremely poor rural households in Rwanda to examine associations of caregiver lifetime trauma, recent daily hardships, mental health, and emotion dysregulation with parenting behaviours reflecting parental acceptance and rejection of their offspring. RESULTS: Cumulative trauma exposure (beta = .234, p < .001) and recent daily hardships (beta = .323, p < .001) are associated with higher levels of internalising symptoms. Trauma (beta = .257, p < .001) and daily hardships (beta = .323, p < 0.001) are also associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Internalising symptoms predict more rejection (beta = .177, p = .001), but show no association with acceptance. Caregiver PTSD symptoms predict more rejection (beta = .277, p < .001) and less acceptance (beta = -.190, p = .003). Both internalising symptoms (beta = .557, p < .001) and PTSD symptoms (beta = .606, p < .001) are strongly associated with poor emotion regulation. Indirect effects suggest that caregiver trauma and hardships affect parenting indirectly via elevated caregiver internalising symptoms and PTSD and that some of these effects are accounted for by emotion dysregulation. CONCLUSIONS: Caregiver internalising and PTSD symptoms are important mechanisms through which caregiver trauma and hardship affect parenting behaviours. Emotion dysregulation is a shared mechanism linking caregivers' mental health problems with parenting behaviours that reflect acceptance and rejection of the child. Emotion regulation is indicated as a key target for prevention of adverse effects of caregiver trauma on mental health and child wellbeing.","['Jensen, Sarah K G', 'Sezibera, Vincent', 'Murray, Shauna M', 'Brennan, Robert T', 'Betancourt, Theresa S']","['Jensen SKG', 'Sezibera V', 'Murray SM', 'Brennan RT', 'Betancourt TS']","['Boston College School of Social Work, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA, USA.', 'Centre for Mental Health, University of Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda.', 'Boston College School of Social Work, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA, USA.', 'Boston College School of Social Work, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA, USA.', ""Women's Study Research Center, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA."", 'Boston College School of Social Work, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20201207,England,J Child Psychol Psychiatry,"Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",0375361,IM,"['*Emotional Regulation', 'Emotions', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Parenting', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Parenting', 'emotional dysregulation', 'internalising disorder', 'post-traumatic stress disorder', 'trauma']",2020/12/08 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2020/12/07 17:12'],"['2020/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/07 17:12 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcpp.13359 [doi]'],ppublish,J Child Psychol Psychiatry. 2021 Aug;62(8):989-999. doi: 10.1111/jcpp.13359.

However, normative responses tend to fall within two camps: on one hand, those oriented towards the biomedical model of psychiatry stress the abuses and superstition of such healing, whilst critics adopting a more 'local' perspective have fundamentally challenged the universalist claims of biomedical diagnostic categories and psychiatric treatments. What seemingly emerges is a dichotomy between those who endorse more 'universalist' or 'relativist' approaches as an analytical lens to the challenges of the diverse healing strands within African contexts. In this article, we draw upon the resources of philosophy and existing empirical work to challenge the notion that constructive dialogue cannot be had between seemingly incommensurable healing practices in global mental health. First, we suggest the need for much-needed conceptual clarity to explore the hermeneutics of meaning, practice, and understanding, in order to forge constructive normative pathways of dialogue between seemingly incommensurable values and conceptual schemas around mental disorder and healing. Second, we contextualise the complex motives to emphasise difference amongst health practitioners within a competitive healing economy. Finally, we appeal to the notion of recovery as discovery as a fruitful conceptual framework which incorporates dialogue, comparative evaluation, and cross-cultural enrichment across divergent conceptualisations of mental health.","['Kong, Camillia', 'Campbell, Megan', 'Kpobi, Lily', 'Swartz, Leslie', 'Atuire, Caesar']","['Kong C', 'Campbell M', 'Kpobi L', 'Swartz L', 'Atuire C']","['Birkbeck College, London, United Kingdom.', 'Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa.', 'University of Ghana, Accra, Ghana.', 'Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, South Africa.', 'University of Ghana, Accra, Ghana.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210324,England,Transcult Psychiatry,Transcultural psychiatry,9708119,IM,"['Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Hermeneutics', '*Mental Disorders/therapy', '*Mental Health Services', '*Psychiatry', '*Psychotic Disorders']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Africa', 'faith healers', 'global mental health', 'hermeneutics', 'recovery']",2021/03/26 06:00,2023/09/08 06:42,['2021/03/25 05:31'],"['2023/09/08 06:42 [medline]', '2021/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/25 05:31 [entrez]']",['10.1177/13634615211000549 [doi]'],ppublish,Transcult Psychiatry. 2023 Jun;60(3):428-442. doi: 10.1177/13634615211000549.

The mental health of younger prisoners has been well researched but this is not the case for older inmates. The aim of this paper is to provide a review of the existing literature on the mental health of older prisoners. METHODS: Relevant papers were identified through database searches and an examination of cited references in the selected papers. The literature was divided into different sections in order to examine the contributing factors and rates of mental illness in older prisoners. RESULTS: The first section looks at demographic factors relevant to older prisoners. Subsequent sections examine psychosocial factors, environmental factors and physical health factors that may have a detrimental effect on mental health. The final sections look at the prevalence of mental illness in older offenders before and after sentencing. CONCLUSIONS: Mental illness in older prisoners is a result of complex interactions between numerous individual and environmental factors. It currently remains poorly researched and service provision for older prisoners with mental illness is poorly developed. Further research is needed, with a particular focus on the different groups of older prisoners and the most beneficial service models, because the number of older prisoners, including those with mental illness, is likely to increase in the future.","['Kakoullis, Alexander', 'Le Mesurier, Nick', 'Kingston, Paul']","['Kakoullis A', 'Le Mesurier N', 'Kingston P']","['Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust, The Caludon Centre, Coventry, UK. alex.kakoullis@nhs.net']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100518,England,Int Psychogeriatr,International psychogeriatrics,9007918,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Environment', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/epidemiology/psychology', '*Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Prisoners/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Psychology']",,,,,2010/05/19 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/05/19 06:00'],"['2010/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S1041610210000359 [pii]', '10.1017/S1041610210000359 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Psychogeriatr. 2010 Aug;22(5):693-701. doi: 10.1017/S1041610210000359.

In this paper, we propose a bootstrapping approach for the development of a digital mental health conversational agent (i.e., chatbot). We start from a basic rule-based expert system and iteratively move towards a more sophisticated platform composed of specialized chatbots each aiming to assess and pre-diagnose a specific mental health disorder using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. During each iteration, user feedback from psychiatrists and patients are incorporated into the iterative design process. A survival of the fittest approach is also used to assess the continuation or removal of a specialized mental health chatbot in each generational design. We anticipate that our unique and novel approach can be used for the development of conversational mental health agents with the ultimate goal of designing a smart chatbot that delivers evidence-based care and contributes to scaling up services while decreasing the pressure on mental health care providers.","['Househ, Mowafa', 'Schneider, Jens', 'Ahmad, Kashif', 'Alam, Tanvir', 'Al-Thani, Dena', 'Siddig, Mohamed Ali', 'Fernandez-Luque, Luis', 'Qaraqe, Marwa', 'Alfuquha, Ala', 'Saxena, Shekhar']","['Househ M', 'Schneider J', 'Ahmad K', 'Alam T', 'Al-Thani D', 'Siddig MA', 'Fernandez-Luque L', 'Qaraqe M', 'Alfuquha A', 'Saxena S']","['Information and Computing Technology Division, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Doha, Qatar.', 'Information and Computing Technology Division, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Doha, Qatar.', 'Information and Computing Technology Division, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Doha, Qatar.', 'Information and Computing Technology Division, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Doha, Qatar.', 'Information and Computing Technology Division, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Doha, Qatar.', 'Community Mental Health Services, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Doha, Qatar.', 'Information and Computing Technology Division, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Doha, Qatar.', 'Information and Computing Technology Division, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Doha, Qatar.', 'Global Health and Population, Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University, United States of America.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Stud Health Technol Inform,Studies in health technology and informatics,9214582,,"['Communication', 'Humans', '*Mental Disorders/diagnosis/therapy', 'Mental Health', '*Mental Health Services', 'Natural Language Processing', '*User-Computer Interface']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Arab world', 'Mental health', 'Qatar', 'anxiety', 'conversational agent', 'depression']",2019/07/28 06:00,2019/09/03 06:00,['2019/07/27 06:00'],"['2019/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['SHTI190060 [pii]', '10.3233/SHTI190060 [doi]']",ppublish,Stud Health Technol Inform. 2019 Jul 4;262:228-231. doi: 10.3233/SHTI190060.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A national cohort of 120,852 Veterans with diabetes and at least one mental health diagnosis (i.e., substance abuse, depression or psychoses) in 2002 was followed through 2006. Outcomes were pharmacy, inpatient and outpatient costs in 2012 dollars. RESULTS: Least-square covariate adjusted estimates from the joint model of total VA costs of the number of MHV using December 31, 2012 value dollars indicate that relative to those with fewer MHV, those with 3+ MHV had the lowest mean inpatient cost ($21,406), but the highest mean outpatient and pharmacy cost ($9,727 and $2,015, respectively). If all Veterans who received zero MHV actually received 3+ MHV, we estimate through simulated scenarios that between $32,272,329 and $181,460,247 in inpatient costs would be saved. However, these savings would be offset by additional expenditures of between $1,166,017,547 and $1,166,224,787 in outpatient costs and between $151,604,683 and $161,439,632 in pharmacy costs. CONCLUSIONS: Among Veterans with diabetes and comorbid mental disorders having three or more mental health visits is associated with marginally decreased inpatient cost, but these potential savings seem to be offset by increased outpatient and pharmacy costs.","['Egede, Leonard E', 'Gebregziabher, Mulugeta', 'Zhao, Yumin', 'Dismuke, Clara E', 'Walker, Rebekah J', 'Hunt, Kelly J', 'Axon, R Neal']","['Egede LE', 'Gebregziabher M', 'Zhao Y', 'Dismuke CE', 'Walker RJ', 'Hunt KJ', 'Axon RN']","['Center for Health Disparities Research, Division of General Internal Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, United States of America.', 'Health Equity and Rural Outreach Innovation Center, Ralph H.

Compared with the national population norms of university students in 2014, our study participants had higher scores in SCL-90. There were statistically significant difference in the Global Severity index (GSI) and all nine subscales scores (p<0.05). Poorer self-rated health, higher study pressure, and lower social support were significant predictors of higher SCL-90 scores (p<0.05) after adjustment for variations in other variables. CONCLUSIONS: College students in Hubei, China may experience a range of different mental health problems, which are associated with their individual, study, and social circumstances.","['Lei, Xiaosheng', 'Liu, Chaojie', 'Jiang, Heng']","['Lei X', 'Liu C', 'Jiang H']","['School of Management, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, P.

The interventions targeted to early-life stress may improve the effectiveness of treating and preventing psychiatric disorders. Brain regions associated with mood and cognition develop rapidly and own heightened plasticity during adolescence. So, manipulating nonpharmacological interventions in fewer side effects and higher acceptance during adolescence, which is a probable window of opportunity, may ameliorate or even reverse the constantly deteriorating impact of early-life stress. The present article reviews animal and people studies about adolescent nonpharmacological interventions for early-life stress. We aim to discuss whether those adolescent nonpharmacological interventions can promote individuals' psychological health who expose to early-life stress.","['Li, Yi', 'Shi, Dong-Dong', 'Wang, Zhen']","['Li Y', 'Shi DD', 'Wang Z']","['Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Psychotic Disorders, Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Psychotic Disorders, Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Institute of Psychological and Behavioral Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.

Unfortunately, the stigma associated with treatment can prevent many service members from seeking and receiving treatment designed to help them recover. Previous studies have examined the impacts of stigma among military personnel as well as civilians; however, stigma among service members currently receiving mental health treatment is unknown. The purpose of this study is to understand the relationships between stigma, demographic variables, and mental health symptoms in a sample of active duty service members receiving mental health services in a partial hospitalization program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional, correlational study collected data from participants in the Psychiatric Continuity Services clinic at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, which offers a four-week partial hospitalization program specializing in trauma recovery for active duty service members of all branches. The data from behavioral health assessments were gathered over a 6-month timespan, including the Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale-24, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5). Stigma was measured using the Military Stigma Scale (MSS). The demographic data collected included military rank and ethnicity. Pearson correlations, t-tests, and linear regression were used to further explore the relationships between the MSS scores, demographic covariates, and behavioral health measures. RESULTS: In unadjusted linear regression models, non-white ethnicity and higher behavioral health assessment intake measures were associated with higher MSS scores. However, after adjusting for gender, military rank, race, and all mental health questionnaires, only Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 intake scores remained associated with MSS scores. No relationship between gender or military rank and average stigma score was observed in either the unadjusted or adjusted regression models. One-way analysis of variance detected a statistically significant difference between the white/Caucasian group and Asian/Pacific Islander group and a near significant difference between white/Caucasian group and black/African American group. The rates of stigma were higher in non-whites than whites. CONCLUSIONS: In this active duty military cohort, greater mental health stigma was associated with greater severity of mental health symptoms, especially post-traumatic stress symptoms. Some evidence found that ethnicity may also play a role in stigma score differences, particularly in the Asian/Pacific Islander group. Service providers could consider assessing mental health stigma to meet the clinical needs of their patients within the context of their willingness to obtain and adhere to treatment. Anti-stigma efforts to reduce stigma and its impacts on mental health are discussed. Additional research investigating the effect stigma has on treatment outcomes would help guide the relative importance of assessing stigma, in addition to other behavioral health realms.","['Zumwalde, Jennifer K', 'Hawkins, Brent L', 'Young, Kathleen M']","['Zumwalde JK', 'Hawkins BL', 'Young KM']","['Recreational Therapist, Psychiatric Continuity Services, Directorate of Behavioral Health, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD 20889-5611, USA.', 'Professor, Recreation Therapy Degree Program, School of Applied Health and Human Sciences, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, NC 28403-5625, USA.', 'Former Service Chief of Psychiatric Continuity Services Clinic, Directorate of Behavioral Health, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD 20889-5611, USA.', 'Currently the Clinical Manager, Psychiatry Department, Acadia Hospital, Bangor, ME 0440, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Mil Med,Military medicine,2984771R,IM,"['Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/psychology', '*Military Personnel', '*Mental Health Services']",,,,,2023/05/16 19:10,2023/08/31 06:41,['2023/05/16 13:34'],"['2022/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2023/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2023/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/08/31 06:41 [medline]', '2023/05/16 19:10 [pubmed]', '2023/05/16 13:34 [entrez]']","['7165305 [pii]', '10.1093/milmed/usad159 [doi]']",ppublish,Mil Med. 2023 Aug 29;188(9-10):e3152-e3159. doi: 10.1093/milmed/usad159.,9-10,,,,"['(c) The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2023.

This increased attention is due, in part, to research documenting higher rates of psychiatric problems, including depression, substance abuse, sleep disturbances, posttraumatic stress disorder, and suicidality in fire rescue personnel compared to civilians. Similarly, the National Institute for Occupation Safety and Health (2014) has identified disturbingly elevated rates of physical health difficulties in firefighters, most notably high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, death due heart attacks, as well as different forms of cancer. Despite the heightened awareness of the mental and physical health challenges in this population, behavioral research specifically targeting firefighters is limited. With this is mind, we asked prominent researchers and clinicians working in this area to present results of their early investigative efforts in our Special Issue on ""First Responder Stress and Mental Health"". In this Introduction, we provide brief summaries of the studies comprising the Issue. Articles in this issue address topics of sleep, PTSD, substance use, physical health concerns, and provide assessment and treatment considerations. A primary goal of the Issue is to stimulate further behavioral research with this group of deserving yet underserved first responders. Moreover, the Issue serves as a tribute to the men and women of the fire service who dedicate and risk their lives to serve their community.","['Van Hasselt, Vincent B', 'Bourke, Michael L', 'Schuhmann, Bailee B']","['Van Hasselt VB', 'Bourke ML', 'Schuhmann BB']","['Nova Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA.', 'Private practice, Springfield, VA, USA.', 'Nova Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211231,United States,Behav Modif,Behavior modification,7803043,IM,"['Female', '*Firefighters/psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health', '*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/psychology/therapy', 'Suicidal Ideation']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Firefighters', 'behavioral health', 'first responders', 'mental health', 'stress']",2022/01/01 06:00,2022/05/06 06:00,['2021/12/31 12:06'],"['2022/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/31 12:06 [entrez]']",['10.1177/01454455211064955 [doi]'],ppublish,Behav Modif. 2022 Mar;46(2):259-266. doi: 10.1177/01454455211064955.
